Wood Siding railway station

Wood Siding railway station was a <a href="Train%20station%23Halt">halt</a> in <a href="Bernwood%20Forest">Bernwood Forest</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, England. It opened in 1871 as a terminus of a short <a href="horsecar">horse-drawn</a> <a href="tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> built to assist the transport of goods from and around the <a href="Richard%20Temple-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Duke of Buckingham</a>'s <a href="Stowe%20House">extensive estates</a> in Buckinghamshire and to connect the Duke's estates to the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>.

In 1872, a lobbying campaign by residents of the town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended a short distance beyond Wood Siding to <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a>, becoming known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. The railway was cheaply built and <a href="land%20grading">ungraded</a>, and used poor quality <a href="steam%20locomotive">locomotives</a>; services were very slow, initially limited to a speed of . In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> in 1899. Between 1908 and 1910 the station was completely rebuilt on a bridge over the newly built <a href="Chiltern%20Main%20Line">Chiltern Main Line</a> of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, which passed directly beneath the station.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the <a href="Metropolitan%20line%20%281933%E2%80%9388%29">Metropolitan line</a> of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>. As a result, Wood Siding became a station on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network, despite being over from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. London Transport's new management aimed to move away from goods services to concentrate on passenger services. As the line served a very lightly populated rural area, the new management believed it very unlikely that it could ever be made viable. Wood Siding was closed, along with the rest of the line, from 30 November 1935. All infrastructure associated with the station was removed in 1936; the remains of the bridge which supported the station are still in place.

On 23 September 1868 the small <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&BR) opened, linking the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>'s station at <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity%20Line">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a>. On 1 September 1894 London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a> commenced on 1 January 1897.

<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">The Duke of Buckingham</a> had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> to carry freight from his <a href="Stowe%20House">estates in Buckinghamshire</a> to the A&BR's line at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>. Because the proposed line ran on land owned by the Duke of Buckingham and by the Winwood Charity Trust, who consented to its construction, the line did not need <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliamentary</a> approval and construction could begin immediately.

The first stage of the line, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Wotton Tramway</a>, was a line from Quainton Road via <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a> to a coal <a href="siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a> at <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by <a href="horsecar">horse trams</a>, the line was built with <a href="baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a> to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers. In November 1871 the tramway was extended to Wood Siding, in a surviving fragment of <a href="Bernwood%20Forest">Bernwood Forest</a> from the town of Brill and from the nearest settlement at <a href="Dorton">Dorton</a>.

Lobbying from residents and businesses in Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to a further extension from Wood Siding to <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a>, at the foot of <a href="Brill%20Hill">Brill Hill</a> of a mile (1.2 km) from the hilltop town of Brill itself, in mid-1872. Two <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s ran each day in each direction, and the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced.
The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built it would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London. The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, and from then on the MR (the <a href="Metropolitan%20line%20%281933%E2%80%9388%29">Metropolitan line</a> of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> from July 1933) operated all services on the line. Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.

The station was positioned on the southern edge of Rushbeds Wood, a surviving part of the Bernwood Forest. It was on the western side of the <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a> over Kingswood Lane. Intended primarily for goods use, Wood Siding initially had no facilities for passengers, and the platform was simply a raised earth bank.

Despite the lack of passenger facilities, Wood Siding was the starting point for the first passenger service to operate on the line. On 26 August 1871 an excursion service ran from Wood Siding to London hauled by the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of 105 passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood Siding and Quainton Road and by <a href="Locomotives%20of%20the%20Great%20Western%20Railway">locomotive</a> from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30 am GWR service via <a href="Princes%20Risborough%20railway%20station">Princes Risborough</a> to London, arriving at 10.00 am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches along the route posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in the week before the excursion. The day itself was extremely rainy, and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return train from London to Quainton Road was delayed in <a href="Slough">Slough</a>, and the excursion eventually arrived back at Wood Siding at 2.00 am.

In 1894 the crude stations on the Brill Tramway were rebuilt in anticipation of the extension to Oxford. The other stations on the line were provided with buildings containing a booking office, waiting rooms and toilets, but Wood Siding station was equipped with a small <a href="corrugated%20iron">corrugated iron</a> waiting room "with shelf and drawer" for passengers. A low passenger platform was also built. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a <a href="buffer%20stop">buffer stop</a> for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single <a href="porter%20%28railroad%29">porter</a>, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. The original Aveling & Porter locomotives were slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before their arrival, but the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway%20A%20Class">more advanced locomotives</a> introduced by the Metropolitan Railway were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large <a href="oak">oak</a> for the porter to watch for oncoming trains.

After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown Marshall</a> passenger carriage on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised at this time to accommodate the new carriage. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.

Limited by poor quality locomotives and <a href="land%20grading">ungraded</a>, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and stopping at four intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly. In 1887 trains took between 15 and 20 minutes to travel approximately one mile from Wood Siding to Brill, and a little over 1 hour 20 minutes from Wood Siding to the <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> with the main line at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Wood Siding to Quainton Road to about 30 minutes.

In 1910 the new <a href="Bicester%20cut-off">Bicester cut-off</a> line of the Great Western Railway <a href="Chiltern%20Main%20Line">Chiltern Main Line</a> was routed directly through Wood Siding, but no interchange station was built. The GWR was to run in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908 and 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line.

With trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, and serving a lightly populated area, the stations at Wood Siding and Brill saw relatively little passenger use, and Wood Siding was removed from the passenger timetable by 1931; trains continued to stop on request. In 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill and Wood Siding stations saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only £191 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the small <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). Thus, despite it being over and over two hours travel from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, Wood Siding became a <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> station. As a cost-cutting measure Wood Siding became unstaffed and the porter's hut was sold as a <a href="garden%20shed">garden shed</a>; from then on, the train crew would work the crossing gate. It was now officially a part of the London Underground network, but Wood Siding—in common with all Metropolitan line stations north of Aylesbury—was never shown on the <a href="tube%20map">tube map</a>.

<a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2000 (about £ in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November. Services on the Brill Tramway were withdrawn completely following the transfer to public ownership; the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a <a href="detour">diversionary route</a>, and they continued to maintain the line and operate freight services until 6 September 1947.

Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services, the lease expired and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&ATC was unable to operate the line. On 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold piecemeal at auction; excluding track, the buildings and structures at Wood Siding fetched a total of £9 2s 6d (about £ in 2019). Aside from the station houses at <a href="Westcott%20railway%20station">Westcott</a> and Brill, which were sold separately, the auction raised £112 10s (about £ in 2019) in total. Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure; the <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact.

With the stations at Wood Siding and Brill closed, and the Great Western Railway's <a href="Brill%20and%20Ludgershall%20railway%20station">Brill and Ludgershall railway station</a> inconveniently sited, the GWR opened a new station on the Chiltern Main Line nearby at <a href="Dorton%20Halt%20railway%20station">Dorton Halt</a> on 21 June 1937. Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963; the line remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and <a href="Bicester%20North%20railway%20station">Bicester North</a>. There are no longer any open railway stations in the vicinity of Brill and Wood Siding.

SMS "Hessen" was the third of five <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the . She was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in 1902, was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in September 1903, and was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) in September 1905. Named after the state of <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a>, the ship was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, "Hessen" was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, she saw only limited service with the German fleet.

"Hessen"s peacetime career centered on <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> and fleet exercises and training cruises. She was involved in two accidental collisions, with a Danish <a href="steamship">steamship</a> in 1911 and a German <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> in 1913. "Hessen" was slated to be withdrawn from service in August 1914, but the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July interrupted that plan and she remained in service with the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. She performed a variety of roles in the first two years, serving as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>, patrolling the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>, and supporting attacks on the British coast, including the <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> in December 1914 and the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a> in April 1916. The following month, "Hessen" was present at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, the largest naval battle of the war. In the last daytime action between capital ships on 31 May, "Hessen" and the other pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron covered the retreat of the battered German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s away from the British battlecruiser squadron.

Jutland revealed how inadequate pre-dreadnoughts like "Hessen" were in the face of more modern weapons, so she and the rest of II Squadron ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. She was decommissioned in December 1916, disarmed and used as a depot ship for the rest of the war. "Hessen" was one of the few obsolete battleships Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Rearmed, she served with the fleet in the 1920s and early 1930s, though she was withdrawn from front-line service in 1934. The following year, "Hessen" was converted into a radio-controlled <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>. She served in this capacity through <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, also working as an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>s. The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the war, renamed Tsel, and served until she was scrapped in 1960.

With the passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, the supplier of naval artillery to the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy), had developed <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a>, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the "Wittelsbach"s. The Design Department of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s as torpedoes became more effective.

Though the "Braunschweig" class marked a significant improvement over earlier German battleships, its design fell victim to the rapid pace of technological development in the early 1900s. The British battleship —armed with ten 30.5 cm (12 in) guns—was commissioned in December 1906, just over a year after "Hessen" entered service. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Hessen" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s.

"Hessen" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. At full load, she <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> . Her crew consisted of 35 <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and 708 <a href="Enlisted%20rank">enlisted men</a>. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">Scotch marine boiler</a>s, all of which burned coal. "Hessen"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of .

"Hessen"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm SK L/40 gun</a>s in twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and eighteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted in the hull below the waterline. One tube was in the bow, two were on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, and the final tube was in the stern. "Hessen" was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick; the heavier armor in the central portion protected her magazines and propulsion machinery, with thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.

"Hessen"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 15 January 1902, at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> under <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 100. The third unit of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "L" as a new unit for the fleet. "Hessen" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 18 September 1903; the vessel was christened by <a href="Princess%20Irene%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Irene of Hesse</a>, and her brother, <a href="Ernest%20Louis%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, gave a speech. The ship began shipyard <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> on 16 May 1905, and was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 19 September. The "Kaiserliche Marine" then began its own sea trials on the ship, which was assigned to <a href="II%20Squadron">II Squadron</a> of the Active Battle Fleet. Trials lasted until 4 March 1906, at which point "Hessen" joined her unit, bringing the squadron to its prescribed strength of eight <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s. The year was spent conducting squadron and fleet training exercises, including a summer cruise in July and August to Norwegian waters. During the fleet maneuvers held every autumn in late August and September, the fleet conducted landing operations at <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde">Eckernförde</a>. Further exercises took place in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> in November.

On 16 February 1907, the fleet was renamed the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. Maneuvers in the North Sea followed in early 1907, which included a cruise to <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> and mock attacks on the main naval base at Kiel. Further exercises followed in May and June, after which the fleet went on a cruise to Norway. After returning, "Hessen" went to <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a> in early August, where <a href="Czar">Czar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a> of Russia met the German fleet in his <a href="yacht">yacht</a> . Afterward, the fleet assembled for the maneuvers that were held every August and September. This year, the maneuvers were delayed to allow for a large <a href="fleet%20review">fleet review</a>, including 112 warships, for <a href="German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> in the <a href="Schillig">Schillig</a> roadstead. In the autumn maneuvers that followed, the fleet conducted exercises in the North Sea and then joint maneuvers with the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Army Corps</a> around <a href="Apenrade">Apenrade</a>. "Hessen" was the II Squadron winner of the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting; at the time, her gunnery officer was then-"<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" (Captain Lieutenant) <a href="Adolf%20von%20Trotha">Adolf von Trotha</a>. In November, the ship took part in unit training in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>.
"Hessen" participated in fleet maneuvers in February 1908 in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and more fleet training off <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> in May and June. In July, "Hessen" and the rest of the fleet sailed into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to conduct a major training cruise. <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a> were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. During the cruise, "Hessen" stopped at <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern as in 1908. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which "Hessen" stopped in <a href="El%20Ferrol">El Ferrol</a>, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. Late in the year, Admiral <a href="Henning%20von%20Holtzendorff">Henning von Holtzendorff</a> became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat posed by the latest underwater weapons like <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s, and to the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.

In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat, between Norway and Denmark. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters in the Kattegat. The annual summer cruise went to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held at <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 29 August. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In March 1911, the fleet conducted exercises in the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and Kattegat. "Hessen" and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons in Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat. During fleet exercises on 23 August 1911, "Hessen" accidentally rammed and sank the Danish steamer . The crew of the steamer was rescued and there were no reported injuries; "Hessen" herself was undamaged in the collision. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a>.

In February, during the very cold winter of 1911–1912, "Hessen" was employed as an emergency <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> in the <a href="Little%20Belt">Little Belt</a> to rescue ships that were threatened by the heavy ice. In mid-1912, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. In July 1913, "Hessen" collided with the torpedo boat . The torpedo boat suffered significant damage and three of its crew were killed, though it did not sink. The boat, along with the rest of her crew, was towed back to Kiel. "Hessen" was not significantly damaged in the accident. The annual summer cruise for 1913 returned to Norwegian waters, as did the cruise the following year. The year 1914 began quietly, with the only event of note being "Hessen"s visit to <a href="Sonderburg">Sonderburg</a> on 2 May to participate in the 50th anniversary celebrations commemorating the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dybb%C3%B8l">Battle of Dybbøl</a> of the <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a>.

Beginning in late 1909, the navy had begun to replace the oldest <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s with the more modern <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, starting with the "Nassau" class. As part of this process, "Hessen" was scheduled to be withdrawn into the reserve on 26 August 1914, with her place in II Squadron taken by the new dreadnought , but the rising tensions in Europe during the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a>, which led to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, interrupted that plan. "Hessen" therefore remained in service with the squadron, the oldest battleship in service with the main fleet. Following Germany's entry into the war in early August, "Hessen" and the rest of the squadron were sent to the <a href="Altenbruch">Altenbruch</a> <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> to support the defense of the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. In October, the squadron went to the Baltic for maneuvers, and while transiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on 26 October, she ran aground and had to be pulled free by <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s. The squadron returned to the North Sea on 17 November, having completed the training exercises.

II Squadron joined the rest of the High Seas Fleet for offensive operations against Britain. The first of these was the <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> on 15 December. The <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> attacked the towns in an attempt to lure out part of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, while the battleships of the High Seas Fleet waited in support in the hopes of ambushing and destroying any British forces that sortied out. During the night of 15–16 December, the German battle fleet of twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens convinced the German commander, Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet, and so he broke off the engagement and turned for home.

"Hessen" was in the shipyard in Kiel for maintenance from 22 February 1915 to 6 March, after which she returned to guard duties off Altenbruch, starting on 10 March. Squadron exercises in the Baltic took place from 18 March to 1 April, and further short periods of maintenance in Kiel followed on 17–18 May, 29–30 May, and 4–26 June; during the last stay, she had supplementary oil-burning equipment installed for her boilers. She spent the rest of the year in the North Sea, taking part in sorties on 11–12 September and 23–24 October. From 6 to 23 December, she went to Wilhelmshaven for maintenance, which was followed by squadron training in the Baltic from 25 December to 20 January 1916. She immediately went to the <a href="Reiherstieg%20Schiffswerfte%20%26amp%3B%20Maschinenfabrik">Reiherstiegwerft</a> in Hamburg for more repair work, which lasted from 22 January to 15 March. On 26 March, after more Baltic exercises, "Hessen" was pronounced ready for further offensive operations.

On 5 April, the "<a href="Admiralstab">Admiralstab</a>" (Admiralty Staff) determined that ships of II Squadron should be periodically sent to guard the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>. "Hessen" performed this duty from 10 to 20 April, when she was replaced by . "Hessen" returned to the North Sea, and was present for another attack on the British coast on 24–25 April. This time, the battlecruisers <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombarded Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a>. During this operation, the battlecruiser was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Visibility was poor, so the operation was quickly called off before the British fleet could intervene and inflict further losses. "Hessen" relieved "Preussen" in the straits on 4 May, remaining there until the 20th. She returned to the rest of the squadron at Altenbruch on 23 May to begin preparing for the next major fleet operation.

"Hessen" took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May–1 June 1916. "Hessen" and the five ships of the formed II Battle Squadron, under the command of "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Franz%20Mauve">Franz Mauve</a>. On 31 May, at 02:00 <a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a>, "VAdm" <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruisers of I Scouting Group steamed out towards the Skagerrak, followed by the rest of the High Seas Fleet an hour and a half later. During the "Run to the North", Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower "Deutschland"-class ships quickly fell behind the faster dreadnoughts. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene, confronting Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower "Deutschland"-class ships; ordering an immediate turn towards Germany would have sacrificed the slower ships.

Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the "Gefechtskehrtwendung", a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. The six ships of II Battle Squadron, having fallen behind, could not conform to the new course following the turn, and fell back to the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.

Late in the day, "Hessen" and the "Deutschland"-class ships performed a vital blocking action that covered the withdrawal of the German battlecruisers. Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>'s battlecruisers had attacked the German ships in the darkness, which had turned westward to evade their attackers, and Mauve had continued in a southerly course, which placed his ships between the British and German battlecruisers. The British battlecruisers turned their attention to the pre-dreadnoughts, which in turn altered their course to the southwest in order to bring all of their guns to bear on the British ships. In the darkness, only muzzle flashes from the British ships could be seen; as a result "Hessen" and the other II Squadron ships held their fire.

At approximately 03:00 on 1 June, a group of British destroyers launched a torpedo attack against the German battle line. At 03:07, "Hessen" narrowly avoided a torpedo, but directly ahead, was struck by at least one at 03:10. The torpedo is believed to have detonated one of the ship's 17 cm (6.7 in) shell magazines, destroying the ship. Aboard "Hessen", it was assumed that a submarine had destroyed "Pommern"; at 03:12 "Hessen" fired her main battery at an imagined submarine. She and several other battleships engaged imaginary submarines again at 05:06, and again at 05:13. Gunfire from "Hessen" and during the latter incident nearly hit the light cruisers and ; Scheer ordered them to cease fire. At 06:55, "Hessen" and mistook a mine buoy dropped by the battleship for a periscope and attacked it. In the course of the battle, "Hessen" had fired five 28 cm rounds, thirty-four 17 cm shells, and twenty-four 8.8 cm rounds. She was not damaged in the engagement.

The experience at Jutland proved that the pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron were a hindrance to the more modern units of the fleet, and so the "Admiralstab" decided that the ships should be withdrawn from service, as their crews could be used more effectively elsewhere. "Hessen" spent the remainder of 1916 alternating between guard duty off Altenbruch and the Danish straits. On 18 November, she went to <a href="Krautsand">Krautsand</a> to assist the dreadnought , which had run aground there. Starting in December, "Hessen" was employed as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> in the Baltic; this was to be her last active service during the war. On 12 December, she was decommissioned and disarmed, after eleven years of service with the fleet.

"Hessen" was thereafter used as a depot ship in <a href="Brunsb%C3%BCttel">Brunsbüttel</a> for I Submarine Flotilla, along with the old <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> . While in reserve at Brunsbüttel, "Hessen" was jokingly referred to as SMS "Kleinste Fahrt" (SMS "Shortest Voyage") because of a warning that had been painted on the ship's hull. The ship's four 28 cm guns were re-mounted as railroad guns and employed on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. The Australian Army captured one of the guns on 8 August 1918; it is preserved as the <a href="Amiens%20Gun">Amiens Gun</a> at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, Australia.

Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under —two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. "Hessen" was among the battleships retained, initially as one of the vessels in reserve. After being refitted, rearmed, and slightly modernized, "Hessen" returned to service with the "Reichsmarine" on 5 January 1925. She received her old gun armament back, with the exception her tertiary battery; she received only four of the 8.8 cm guns, with another four in high-angle anti-aircraft mounts. Four torpedo tubes were installed in above-water casemates in the main deck. Her coal-fired cylindrical boilers were replaced with a pair of new <a href="fuel%20oil">oil</a>-fired models. After spending the first half of the year conducting sea trials and individual training, "Hessen" joined the fleet for a voyage to Norway in June, reminiscent of the old peacetime summer cruises of the Imperial fleet. Fleet training exercises followed later in the year.

At the start of 1926, "Hessen" was tasked with clearing paths for merchant vessels in the iced-over Baltic. She also made visits to the ports of <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>, Latvia, and <a href="Reval">Reval</a>, Estonia, during this period. The ship joined the pre-dreadnought , the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of "VAdm" <a href="Konrad%20Mommsen">Konrad Mommsen</a>, for a trip to Spain that lasted from 12 May to 19 June. During the cruise, "Hessen" visited the Canary Islands and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> in the central Atlantic. In July, "Hessen" and the torpedo boat <a href="SMS%20V190">"T190"</a> visited <a href="Neufahrwasser">Neufahrwasser</a>; they were the first German warships to visit Danzig since Germany lost control of the city to Poland after the war. The next two years passed uneventfully, and in July 1928, "Hessen" visited Norway with Admiral <a href="Hans%20Zenker">Hans Zenker</a>, the chief of the "Reichsmarine", aboard. Another cruise to Spain took place from 18 April to 9 May 1929, with "VAdm" <a href="Iwan%20Christian%20Hermann%20Oldekop">Iwan Oldekop</a> flying his flag aboard "Schleswig-Holstein". "Hessen" visited <a href="A%20Pobra%20do%20Carami%C3%B1al">Caraminal</a>, <a href="Vilagarc%C3%ADa%20de%20Arousa">Villagarcia</a>, and El Ferrol, Spain, during the trip. "Hessen" steamed to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden, on 30 August, remaining there until 5 September.

A major fleet training cruise to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> took place in 1930, lasting from 3 April to 16 June. During the tour, "Hessen" stopped in numerous ports, including <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>, <a href="Alicante">Alicante</a> and <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> in Spain, <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> and <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, and <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, Italy. Following the fleet training exercises in August and September that year, she visited <a href="Kristiansand">Kristiansand</a>, Norway. The fleet visited <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Świnoujście</a>, Poland, on 18 and 19 April 1931 before returning to Hamburg. She cruised off Norway from 15 June to 3 July. At some point in 1931, "Hessen" had two of her 17 cm guns and all four of the low-angle 8.8 cm guns removed. The following year, she visited <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>, <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, and Danzig, and in 1933 she made another trip to Reval. "Hessen" paid a visit to <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> and <a href="Sognefjord">Sognefjord</a>, Norway, in July 1934 before participating in what would be her final annual fleet maneuvers later that year. She departed Kiel on 25 September and steamed to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 12 November. Her crew were sent to the new armored ship , which replaced "Hessen" in the fleet.

On 31 March 1935, "Hessen" was struck from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a> and converted into a target ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed room for two additional <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; "Hessen" retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s for the main battery turrets. Her reciprocating machinery was replaced with <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by remote control when being used as a target. The work lasted from 11 April 1935 to 1 April 1937; beginning in April, she conducted sea trials, and on 12 July she was formally assigned to the gunnery training unit, in what had previously been renamed the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>". The first ship to use "Hessen" as a target was the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> on 30 August that year.

"Hessen" served in this capacity through <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. On 31 March 1940, "Hessen" acted as an icebreaker for the <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a>s , , and , on their trip from Kiel to the North Sea. She and her control ship, the ex-destroyer "Blitz", were ceded to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> on 2 January 1946 in Wilhelmshaven. She was recommissioned on 3 June 1946 as "Tsel" (with "Blitz" being renamed "Wystrel"), and continued to operate as a target ship until she was scrapped in 1960.

SMS Deutschland (1904)

SMS "Deutschland (His Majesty's Ship "Germany) was the first of five <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). The ship was armed with a main battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> in two twin turrets. She was built at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, where she was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in June 1903 and <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in November 1904. She was commissioned on 3 August 1906, a few months ahead of . The latter, armed with ten large-caliber guns, was the first of a revolutionary new standard of <a href="dreadnought">"all-big-gun" battleships</a> that rendered "Deutschland" and the rest of her class obsolete.

"Deutschland" served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> until 1913, when she was transferred to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a>. With the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July 1914, she and her sister ships were tasked with defending the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> and the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> from possible British incursions. "Deutschland" and the other ships of the II Battle Squadron participated in most of the large-scale fleet operations in the first two years of the war, culminating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916. Late on the first day of the battle, "Deutschland" and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s before retreating.

After the battle, in which pre-dreadnoughts proved too vulnerable against more modern battleships, "Deutschland" and her three surviving sisters were assigned to coastal defense duties. By 1917, they had been withdrawn from combat service completely, disarmed, and tasked with auxiliary roles. "Deutschland" was used as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> until the end of the war. She was struck from the naval register on 25 January 1920, sold to ship breakers that year, and <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap by 1922.

The passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> in 1900 under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s, and shortly thereafter design work began on a follow-on design, which became the . The "Deutschland"-class ships were broadly similar to the "Braunschweig"s, featuring incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s to save weight. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Deutschland".

"Deutschland" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal loading, and up to at full loading. The ship was equipped with two heavy <a href="military%20mast">military mast</a>s. Her crew numbered 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. Powered by three <a href="triple%20expansion%20steam%20engine">triple expansion steam engine</a>s that each drove a <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a>, "Deutschland" was capable of a top speed of from . Twelve coal-fired <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">Scotch marine boiler</a>s provided steam for the engines; three <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> vented smoke from burning coal in the boilers. "Deutschland" had a fuel capacity of up to of coal. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for .

"Deutschland"s primary armament consisted of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns in two twin turrets. Her offensive armament was rounded out with fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns mounted individually in casemates. A battery of twenty <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45</a> guns in single mounts provided defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. As was customary for <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of the period, she was also equipped with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, which were in the submerged part of the hull. <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a> protected the ship. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick. Heavy armor amidships protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces, while thinner plating covered the ends of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">main-deck</a> armor was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Deutschland" was the second naval vessel to bear that name—after the 1874 armored frigate . The modern ship was intended to fight in the German <a href="line%20of%20battle">battle line</a> with other battleships of the Imperial German Navy. She was laid down on 20 July 1903 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, and launched on 19 November 1904. Her trials lasted from 3 August 1906 until the end of September. "Deutschland" replaced the battleship as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Active Battle Fleet on 26 September, when Admiral <a href="Prince%20Heinrich%20of%20Prussia">Prince Heinrich</a> hoisted his flag aboard. Her first commander was "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" ("KzS"—Captain at Sea) <a href="Wilhelm%20Becker%20%28Admiral%29">Wilhelm Becker</a>, though he served aboard the ship for just a month and was replaced by "KzS" in September. She was tactically assigned to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a>, displacing the older battleship , though as the fleet flagship she was not subordinate to the squadron commander. Prince Heinrich was new to the command, and he set about to train the fleet, with an emphasis on accurate gunfire and maneuvering as a unit.

She took part in training exercises in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, in December 1906, before returning to Kiel. On 16 February 1907, the fleet was renamed the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. Fleet maneuvers in the North Sea followed, in early 1907, with a cruise to <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a>, Denmark, followed by mock attacks on the main naval base at Kiel. Further exercises followed in May–June. In June, a cruise to Norway followed the fleet training. After returning from Norway, "Deutschland" went to <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a> in early August, where Czar <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a> of Russia met the German fleet in his <a href="yacht">yacht</a> . Afterward, the fleet assembled for the annual autumn fleet maneuvers, held with the bulk of the fleet every August and September. This year, the maneuvers were delayed to allow for a large <a href="fleet%20review">fleet review</a>, including 112 warships, for <a href="German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> in the <a href="Schillig">Schillig</a> roadstead. In the autumn maneuvers that followed, the fleet conducted exercises in the North Sea and then joint maneuvers with the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Army Corps</a> around <a href="Apenrade">Apenrade</a>. "Deutschland" returned to Kiel on 14 September, after the conclusion of the maneuvers. In November, she took part in unit training in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, before she was taken into <a href="dry-dock">dry-dock</a> for an annual refit.

In February 1908, "Deutschland" participated in fleet maneuvers in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. With Wilhelm II aboard, she was present for the launch of the first German <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>, , on 7 March, and afterward carried the Kaiser to visit the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, accompanied by the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> . In May–June, fleet training was conducted off Helgoland; <a href="Wilhelm%2C%20German%20Crown%20Prince">Crown Prince Wilhelm</a>, the Kaiser's son, observed the exercises aboard "Deutschland". In July 1908, "Deutschland" and the rest of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a> were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. During the cruise, "Deutschland" stopped at <a href="Funchal">Funchal</a>, Portugal and <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures.

The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern. "KzS" <a href="Ehler%20Behring">Ehler Behring</a> replaced von Krosigk in April. In June, "Deutschland" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting in the II Squadron. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which "Deutschland" stopped in <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. After another round of exercises, "Deutschland" went in for a periodic overhaul. During the refit, she was given additional pedestal-mounted searchlights and became the first ship in the German navy to be equipped with an X-ray machine. In late 1909, Prince Heinrich was replaced by Admiral <a href="Henning%20von%20Holtzendorff">Henning von Holtzendorff</a>, who kept "Deutschland" as his flagship. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.

In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 29 August. "Deutschland" again won the "Schießpreis" that year. In November, "Deutschland", accompanied by the <a href="aviso">aviso</a> and the <a href="dispatch%20boat">dispatch boat</a> , hosted Wilhelm II during the celebration of the opening of the <a href="Naval%20Academy%20M%C3%BCrwik">Naval Academy Mürwik</a> in <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>. "Deutschland" had too deep a draft to enter <a href="Gelting%20Bay">Gelting Bay</a> outside the <a href="Flensburg%20Firth">Flensburg Firth</a>, so Wilhelm II transferred to "Sleipner". A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In early March 1911, "Deutschland" again carried Wilhelm II to Helgoland; this trip was followed by fleet exercises in the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and Kattegat that month. "Deutschland" and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat, and "Deutschland" won the "Schießpreis" a third time. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a>. <a href="Theobald%20von%20Bethmann-Hollweg">Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg</a>, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor of Germany</a>, also attended the review, aboard "Deutschland". On 1 October, "Deutschland" was relieved of her tactical assignment to the II Squadron, as the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet) authorized the fleet to keep a 17th battleship in commission—the I and II Squadrons comprising eight battleships each, so the fleet could now keep two full squadrons in addition to the flagship.

In mid-1912, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. In September, following the autumn maneuvers, "Deutschland" suffered a <a href="Ship%20grounding">grounding</a> while in the Baltic. The resulting damage necessitated dry-docking, and repairs were completed by November, allowing the ship to take part in the winter cruise in the Baltic. In October, during the repair period, "KzS" <a href="Hugo%20Meurer">Hugo Meurer</a> took command of the ship. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part due to Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision. "VAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a> took Holtzendorff's place that day; but only one day later, on the 31st, he lowered his flag aboard "Deutschland" to transfer to the new dreadnought , which replaced "Deutschland" as flagship. The golden bow ornament that denoted the flagship was removed, and "Deutschland" returned to the ranks of the II Battle Squadron. The year's training proceeded in much the same pattern as in previous years. "Deutschland" briefly resumed flagship duties in late 1913, as "Friedrich der Grosse" was in dry-dock for periodic maintenance.

On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. The threat of war during the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> caused Kaiser Wilhelm II to end the cruise early, after only two weeks; and by the end of July the fleet was back in port. "Deutschland" reached Kiel on the 29th, and moved to Wilhelmshaven on 1 August. With the outbreak of war, "Deutschland" and the rest of the II Squadron was tasked with coastal defense at the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. This duty was interrupted from 2 to 23 October, when the ship returned to Wilhelmshaven, and from 27 October to 4 November, for an overhaul in Kiel. On 10 November, she took part in a sweep into the Baltic toward <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>, which concluded uneventfully two days later. By 17 November, the ship was again stationed off the coast near the Elbe. While her sisters covered the <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on the English coast</a> on 15–16 December, "Deutschland" remained on picket duty at the mouth of the Elbe.

"Deutschland" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 21 January, where, two days later, Ingenohl temporarily made the ship his flagship while "Friedrich der Grosse" was transferred to the Baltic for training exercises. During this period, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> took place, where the German <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> was sunk and the battleships of the High Seas Fleet failed to intervene. Ingenohl, who had returned to "Friedrich der Grosse" on 1 February, was relieved of command and replaced by "VAdm" <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a>. "Deutschland" returned to her coastal patrol duties off the Elbe. On 21 February 1915, "Deutschland" went into dock in Kiel, where work lasted until 12 March. Afterward, "Deutschland" returned to the Elbe for guard duty, and on 14 March she became the II Squadron flagship under "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Felix%20Funke">Felix Funke</a>, though he was replaced by "KAdm" on 12 August. On 21 September, the ship went to the Baltic for training, which was completed by 11 October, after which she went into the dockyard in Kiel again for maintenance.

Coastal defense duty continued into early 1916. "Deutschland" was transferred to the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> dry-dock in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> for further maintenance that took place from 27 February to 1 April 1916. On 24–25 April 1916, "Deutschland" and her four sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet—which was now commanded by "VAdm" <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>—to support the battlecruisers of the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> on a raid of the English coast. En route to the target, the battlecruiser was damaged by a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a>; she was detached to return home while the operation proceeded. The battlecruisers conducted a short <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a>. Visibility was poor, and the operation was called off before the British fleet could intervene. On 4 May, "Deutschland" took part in a sortie against British ships off <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a>, without result. Squadron exercises in the Baltic followed from 11 to 22 May.

Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to "Seydlitz" delayed the operation until the end of May. The II Battle Squadron—possessing the weakest battleships involved in the battle, and under-strength owing to the absence of , guarding the mouth of the Elbe, and , worn out and removed from active service—was positioned at the rear of the German line. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> under the command of <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that resulted the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. Upon realizing that the German fleet was coming into range, Beatty turned his ships back toward the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British <a href="5th%20Battle%20Squadron">5th Battle Squadron</a> at top speed. "Deutschland" and the other pre-dreadnoughts were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts, and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet's maneuverability was severely hampered by the presence of the pre-dreadnoughts; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape.

Scheer reversed the course of the fleet via a "Gefechtskehrtwendung" (battle about turn), a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. Having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. "Deutschland" and the other five ships of the squadron were therefore on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line. Later in the day, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British counterparts. "Deutschland" and the other so-called "five-minute ships" came to their aid by steaming between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Poor visibility made the subsequent engagement brief. "Deutschland" fired only one round from her 28 cm guns during this period. Mauve decided it would be inadvisable to continue the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers, and so ordered an <a href="Points%20of%20the%20compass">8-point</a> turn to starboard.

Late on the 31st, the fleet organized for the night march back to Germany; "Deutschland", "Pommern", and "Hannover" fell in behind and the other dreadnoughts of the III Battle Squadron towards the rear of the line. British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which targeted "Deutschland". In the melee, "Deutschland" and "König" turned away from the attacking destroyers, but could not make out targets clearly enough to engage them effectively, "Deutschland" firing only a few 8.8 cm shells in the mist without effect. Soon after, "Pommern" exploded after she was struck by at least one torpedo. Fragments of the ship rained down around "Deutschland". Regardless, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the "Nassau" and es took up defensive positions while the damaged ships and the survivors of the II Squadron retreated within the harbor. In the course of the battle, "Deutschland" had expended only a single 28 cm shell and five 8.8 cm rounds. She had not been damaged in the engagement.

After Jutland, "Deutschland" and her three surviving sisters returned to picket duty at the mouth of the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">on 18 August</a>. In July, "KzS" <a href="Rudolf%20Bartels">Rudolf Bartels</a> replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by "Deutschland"s final commander, "KzS" Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, "Deutschland" lay idle in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kiel">Bay of Kiel</a>. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, "Deutschland" had her forwardmost pair of 8.8 cm guns in the aft <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> removed and two 8.8 cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.

"Deutschland" sailed out of the Altenbruch <a href="roadstead">roads</a> at the mouth of the Elbe on 28 July and then to the Baltic for continued guard duty. During this period, she briefly served as the flagship of the coastal defense command in the western Baltic, though on 10 September the cruiser replaced her. On 15 August, the II Battle Squadron was disbanded. Two weeks later, on 31 August, "Deutschland" arrived in Kiel. She was decommissioned on 10 September. "Deutschland" then had her guns removed before she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven to serve as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>. Many of her guns were converted for use ashore, either as <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a>, <a href="field%20gun">field gun</a>s, or <a href="railway%20gun">railway gun</a>s. On 25 January 1920 the ship was struck from the naval register and sold for scrapping, which was completed by 1922. The ship's bow ornament is on display at the <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde">Eckernförde</a> underwater weapons school, and her bell is in the mausoleum of Prince Heinrich at the Hemmelmark estate.

Turbinellus floccosus

Turbinellus floccosus, sometimes known as the shaggy, scaly, or woolly chanterelle, is a <a href="Basidiocarp%23Types">cantharelloid</a> mushroom of the family <a href="Gomphaceae">Gomphaceae</a> native to Asia and North America. It was known as Gomphus floccosus until 2011, when it was found to be only distantly related to the genus's <a href="type%20species">type</a> species, "<a href="Gomphus%20clavatus">G. clavatus</a>". It was consequently transferred from "<a href="Gomphus%20%28fungus%29">Gomphus</a>" to "<a href="Turbinellus">Turbinellus</a>". The orange-capped vase- or trumpet-shaped <a href="basidiocarp">fruiting bodies</a> may reach 30 cm (12 in) high and 30 cm (12 in) wide. The lower surface, the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> or pores, and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish.

"T. floccosus" forms symbiotic (<a href="Mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a>) relationships with various types of <a href="conifer">conifer</a>, growing in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from North Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, in late summer and autumn. Though mild-tasting, they generally cause <a href="Human%20digestive%20system">gastrointestinal</a> symptoms of <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a> and <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> when consumed. "T. floccosus" is eaten by local people in northeastern India, Nepal and Mexico.

This species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Cantherellus floccosus" in 1834 by American mycologist <a href="Lewis%20David%20de%20Schweinitz">Lewis David de Schweinitz</a>, who reported it growing in beech woods in <a href="Mount%20Pocono%2C%20Pennsylvania">Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania</a>. Its <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "floccus", meaning "tuft, or flock, of wool". In 1839, <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> named a specimen from Canada as "Cantharellus canadensis" based on a manuscript by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Klotzsch">Johann Friedrich Klotzsch</a>, noting its affinity to "C. clavatus". A large specimen collected in Maine by <a href="Charles%20James%20Sprague">Charles James Sprague</a> was described as "Cantharellus princeps" in 1859 by Berkeley and <a href="Moses%20Ashley%20Curtis">Moses Ashley Curtis</a>. In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> renamed "Cantharellus canadensis" as "Trombetta canadensis", and "C. floccosus" as "Merulius floccosus".

<a href="Franklin%20Sumner%20Earle">Franklin Sumner Earle</a> made "C. floccosus" the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the new genus "<a href="Turbinellus">Turbinellus</a>" in 1909, in which he placed two other North American species. He remarked that the three "constitute a striking and well-marked genus which seems to have more in common with the club-shaped species of "<a href="Craterellus">Craterellus</a>" than with the following genus where they have always been placed." This was not widely taken up, as Earle's <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> was not published <a href="valid%20name%20%28botany%29">validly</a> according to <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">nomenclatural rules</a>.

American mycologist <a href="Elizabeth%20Eaton%20Morse">Elizabeth Eaton Morse</a> described "Cantharellus bonarii" in 1930. The <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> was <a href="General%20Grant%20National%20Park">General Grant National Park</a> in <a href="Fresno%20County%2C%20California">Fresno County, California</a>. In 1945 "C. floccosus" and Morse's "C. bonarii" were transferred to "<a href="Gomphus%20%28fungus%29">Gomphus</a>" by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>. The generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> γομφος, "gomphos", meaning "plug" or "large wedge-shaped nail". <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alex H. Smith</a> treated the members of "Gomphus" as two <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a>s—"Gomphus" and "Excavatus"—within "Cantharellus" in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the genera. The shaggy chanterelle was placed in the latter section due to its scaly cap, lack of <a href="clamp%20connections">clamp connections</a> and rusty-colored <a href="basidiospores">spores</a>. <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a> classified it in the genus "Nevrophyllum", before <a href="E.%20J.%20H.%20Corner">E. J. H. Corner</a> returned it to "Gomphus" in 1966.

The genus "Gomphus", along with several others in the Gomphaceae, was reorganized in the 2010s after <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis confirmed that the older <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>-based classification did not accurately represent <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships. Thus the genus "Turbinellus" was resurrected and the taxon became "Turbinellus floccosus". Giachini also concluded "G. bonarii" was the same species.

"T. floccosus" has been given the common names of "scaly vase chanterelle", "scaly chanterelle", "woolly chanterelle", or "shaggy chanterelle", though it is more closely related to <a href="stinkhorn">stinkhorn</a>s than <a href="Cantharellaceae">true chanterelles</a>. In <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, in the <a href="Sherpa%20language">Sherpa language</a>, it is known as "diyo chyau" or "khumbhe chyau", from the words "diyo", meaning "oil lamp" and "chyau", meaning "mushroom", as the fruit bodies have a shape similar to the local oil lamps. In Mexico, it is known as "corneta" or "trompeta", or by the indigenous words "oyamelnanácatl" ("fir mushroom", from Nahuatl "oyametl" "fir", and "nanacatl" "mushroom"), "tlapitzal" (derived from "<a href="tlapitzalli">tlapitzalli</a>", Nahuatl for "trumpet") or "tlapitzananácatl" in <a href="Tlaxcala">Tlaxcala</a>.

Adult <a href="Basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are initially cylindrical, maturing to trumpet- or vase-shaped and reaching up to 30 cm (12 in) high and up to 30 cm (12 in) across. There is no clear demarcation between the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> and <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. The stipe can be up to 15 cm (6 in) tall and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide, though it tapers to a narrower base. It is solid in younger specimens, though is often hollowed out by insect larvae in older. At higher elevations, two or three fruit bodies may arise from one stipe. Colored various shades of reddish- to yellowish-orange, the cap surface is broken into scales, with the spaces between more yellow and the scales themselves more orange. The most colorful specimens occur in warm humid weather. Older specimens are often paler.

The white <a href="Trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is fibrous and thick, though thins with age. Somewhat brittle, it can sometimes turn brown when cut or bruised. The smell has been reported as indistinct or "earthy and sweet", and the taste "sweet and sour". The <a href="hymenium">spore-bearing undersurface</a> is irregularly folded, forked or ridged rather than gilled and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish in color. These ridges are up to high, and are decurrent—they extend below and run down the cap's attachment to the stipe, though irregularly so. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is brownish, the <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> ellipsoid with dimensions of 12.4–16.8 × 5.8–7.3 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. The spore surface is roughened with ornamentations that can be made visible under the microscope by <a href="staining">staining</a> with <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a>.

The fruit bodies can last for some considerable time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name <a href="form%20%28botany%29">forma</a> "rainierensis". Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, such as in the <a href="redwood%20forest">redwood forest</a>s, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma "wilsonii". American mycologist <a href="Ron%20Petersen">R. H. Petersen</a> described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.

The related "<a href="Turbinellus%20kauffmanii">Turbinellus kauffmanii</a>", found in western North America, is similar-looking but has a pale brown cap. Younger specimens of the latter species also have a pungent smell. "<a href="Turbinellus%20fujisanensis">Turbinellus fujisanensis</a>", found in Japan, is another lookalike that has smaller spores than "T. floccosus".

The fungus appears to form symbiotic (<a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l) relationships with various conifers including <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> ("Pseudotsuga menziesii"), <a href="fir">fir</a> ("Abies") species such as momi fir ("<a href="Abies%20firma">Abies firma</a>"), European silver fir ("<a href="Abies%20alba">A. alba</a>") and Khinghan fir ("<a href="Abies%20nephrolepis">A. nephrolepis</a>"), <a href="Pine">Pine</a> ("Pinus") species such as "<a href="Pinus%20densiflora">Pinus densiflora</a>" and western hemlock ("<a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">Tsuga heterophylla</a>"). In Mexico, the fungus associates with "<a href="Abies%20religiosa">Abies religiosa</a>"—the <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association between these two species has been synthesized under controlled laboratory conditions. "T. floccosus" is more abundant in older stands of trees and places where there is more decomposed wood on the forest floor. The species occurs in <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous forests</a> in North America, particularly the western states in late summer and autumn. It is most abundant in rainy parts of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, northern California and the Sierra Nevada. It also occurs across Asia, having been recorded from Japan, North Korea, China, Tibet, India, Nepal and Pakistan. "Turbinellus floccosus" has been occasionally recorded from introduced conifer plantations in Australia.

"Turbinellus floccosus" is poisonous to some people who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A <a href="tricarboxylic%20acid">tricarboxylic acid</a> known as α-tetradecylcitric acid may be responsible for the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased <a href="Muscle%20tone">tone</a> of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to <a href="mydriasis">mydriasis</a>, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. "Turbinellus floccosus" contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related "T. kauffmanii".

Despite its toxicity, "T. floccosus" is one of the ten wild mushrooms most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in <a href="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a>, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of <a href="Sagarmatha%20National%20Park">Sagarmatha National Park</a> in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of "T. floccosus" are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.

The fruit body of "T. floccosus" produces <a href="oxylipin">oxylipin</a> (<a href="biological%20activity">biologically active</a> <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s generated from <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s) that have <a href="antifungal">antifungal</a> activity against the <a href="plant%20pathogen">plant pathogen</a>s "<a href="Colletotrichum%20fragariae">Colletotrichum fragariae</a>", "<a href="Colletotrichum%20gloeosporioides">C. gloeosporioides</a>", and "<a href="Colletotrichum%20acutatum">C. acutatum</a>". Extracts of the fungus have shown in <a href="Agar%20diffusion%20test">standard laboratory tests</a> to have <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> activity against several <a href="human%20pathogen">human pathogen</a>ic strains. "T. floccosus" also contains the <a href="spermidine">spermidine</a> derivative pistillarin, a bioactive compound that inhibits <a href="DNA%20damage">DNA damage</a> by <a href="hydroxyl%20radical">hydroxyl radical</a>s generated by the <a href="Fenton%20reaction">Fenton reaction</a>. Pistillarin is responsible for the green color obtained when <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification%23Iron%20salts">iron salts</a> are applied to the fruit body surface.

Made on a shoestring budget of , "Kahaani" was conceived and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with <a href="Advaita%20Kala">Advaita Kala</a>. The crew often employed <a href="guerrilla%20filmmaking">guerrilla-filmmaking</a> techniques on <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>'s city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. "Kahaani" explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>'s films such as "<a href="Charulata">Charulata</a>" (1964), "<a href="Aranyer%20Dinratri">Aranyer Dinratri</a>" (1970) and "<a href="Joi%20Baba%20Felunath%20%28film%29">Joi Baba Felunath</a>" (1979).

A sequel, titled "", was released on 2 December 2016.

A poison-gas attack on a Kolkata Metro Rail compartment kills the passengers on board. Two years later Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), a pregnant software engineer, arrives in Kolkata from London during the Durga Puja festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki "Rana" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'Mello (Colleen Blanche), the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar (Shantilal Mukherjee), an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a car during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, after shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu (Abir Chatterjee), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee (Darshan Jariwala), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.


<a href="Sujoy%20Ghosh">Sujoy Ghosh</a> approached novelist and script writer <a href="Advaita%20Kala">Advaita Kala</a> with the idea for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books "Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled" by Maloy Krishna Dhar and "India's External Intelligence: Secrets of <a href="Research%20and%20Analysis%20Wing">Research and Analysis Wing</a> (RAW)" by V. K. Singh.

Ghosh, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay, began to plan the film while awaiting the release of his previous film "<a href="Aladin%20%282009%20film%29">Aladin</a>" (2009), but the dismal response to "Aladin" was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for "Kahaani", but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. <a href="Yashraj%20Films">Yashraj Films</a> were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined because he did not want that much commitment.

Bengali film actor <a href="Prosenjit%20Chatterjee">Prosenjit Chatterjee</a> encouraged Ghosh to shoot in Kolkata. Ghosh finally selected Kolkata for several reasons: the director's acquaintance with the city, its mix of modernity and old-world charm, and budget constraints. Kolkata is a cheaper location than Mumbai or Delhi, where most Bollywood films are shot.

Ghosh admitted in an interview that after his two preceding directorial ventures—"Aladin" and "<a href="Home%20Delivery%20%28film%29">Home Delivery</a>" (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, "Kahaani" was his last chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.

Vidya Balan was the first choice of both writer Advaita Kala and director Sujoy Ghosh. Ghosh had planned for a long time to work with Vidya and approached her in 2010. Unimpressed with the plot outline, Vidya refused, only changing her mind after having read the completed script.

Ghosh chose mostly Bengali actors as he wanted to make the characters as authentic as possible. The role of the Inspector Satyoki "Rana" Sinha was first offered to <a href="Chandan%20Roy%20Sanyal">Chandan Roy Sanyal</a>, but he could not take the part due to other commitments. Parambrata Chatterjee, a <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali actor</a> whose acting in the film "<a href="The%20Bong%20Connection">The Bong Connection</a>" (2006) had impressed Ghosh at the <a href="Mumbai%20Academy%20of%20the%20Moving%20Image">Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image</a> festival, was later offered the role in "Kahaani". Chatterjee had earlier worked with Vidya in her début film "<a href="Bhalo%20Theko">Bhalo Theko</a>" (2003).

The casting director Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui for the role of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised that for the first time he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.

Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.

Before the shooting of the film began, Vidya started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women to learn about the typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during the shooting.

While briefing Saswata Chatterjee about his character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh used the phrase ""Binito Bob"" (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh was surprised at how Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.

Parambrata Chatterjee said in an interview that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background. Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research "on their work, mindset and other relevant things" to prepare for the role. The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour. Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, and wondered how he could portray the arrogance needed for the character. Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism. Khan smokes a relatively cheap brand of cigarette (<a href="Gold%20Flake">Gold Flake</a>) despite his high official post; Siddiqui had smoked that brand of cigarette throughout his struggling days in Bollywood and thereafter.

Filming took place on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often employed the art of <a href="guerrilla%20filmmaking">guerrilla filmmaking</a> (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, "Kahaani" was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included <a href="Kalighat">Kalighat</a> Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, <a href="Kumartuli">Kumartuli</a>, <a href="Howrah%20Bridge">Howrah Bridge</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Memorial">Victoria Memorial</a>, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of <a href="Vijayadashami">Vijayadashami</a> (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a "<a href="Barowari">Barowari</a>" (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the <a href="Ballygunge">Ballygunge</a> neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in "Sindoor khela"—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply "<a href="sindoor">sindoor</a>" (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to "sindoor" could be avoided.

Ghosh chose the guest house in which the protagonist stays after noticing it during his visit to a neighbouring hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for , and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.

After "<a href="Ishqiya">Ishqiya</a>" (2010), "<a href="No%20One%20Killed%20Jessica">No One Killed Jessica</a>" (2011) and "<a href="The%20Dirty%20Picture">The Dirty Picture</a>" (2011), "Kahaani" was Vidya's fourth <a href="women%27s%20film">woman-centric film</a> to win widespread praise for her unconventional approach to portraying strong female roles. According to <a href="Zee%20News">Zee News</a>, "Kahaani" is a woman's film about "role reversals, breaking of stereotypes, turning clichés inside out, a woman's journey, and the way she carves a niche for herself in the male-dominated mentalscape of the society." Trisha Gupta of "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" also finds feminist themes in the film. For Ghosh, one aspect of his project "is a study of motherhood"; the instinct of a mother to protect her baby inspired him to develop the story.

A recurring theme is the fleeting hint of romance between Rana and Vidya. Ghosh said that this delicate romance was "the most progressive thing" in the film—a suggestion that a man could fall in love with a pregnant woman. The director explained that the boy was initially "fascinated by someone who is literally a hero in his eyes", as Rana was awed by the computer skills of Vidya. Gradually, the fascinated boy moves into a zone where he tries to protect her.

Some reviewers note that a major protagonist is Kolkata itself, which is "brimming with warm, sympathetic inhabitants". A review in Rediff.com notes that the director pays a "fond yet understated tribute" to the city by incorporating imagery such as "yellow taxis, leisurely trams, congested traffic, claustrophobic metros, dilapidated brick houses, tapering alleys, rajnigandhas, lal paad saris, piping hot luchis". According to the reviewer, "Kahaani" did not depend on the tropes of Kolkata culture typically used in Bollywood film—"O-emphasizing accent, dramatic play of conch shells, <a href="rasgulla">rasgulla</a>/<a href="mishti%20doi">mishti doi</a> excesses." The director acknowledges that Kolkata "becomes a central character" of the film. Gautaman Bhaskaran, writing for "<a href="Gulf%20Times">Gulf Times</a>", notes that Kolkata imagery was polished up in the film; noted Bengali director <a href="Srijit%20Mukherji">Srijit Mukherji</a> argues that the portrayal of the city in "Kahaani" was akin to a "<a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a> exotica" on the city. Uddalak Mukherjee of "The Telegraph" explains that Kolkata in "Kahaani" was cosmetic and lacked a deep menacing presence. Mukherjee argues the depiction of the city never matches the level of <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>'s <a href="Calcutta%20trilogy">Calcutta trilogy</a>, where "aided by bloodshed, greed and decadence, ...Calcutta ..., even though a place of dreams, desires and hope, slides irreversibly into chaos, anxiety and a moral crisis, taking its residents with it".

Durga Puja, the autumnal festival to worship goddess <a href="Durga">Durga</a>, plays a prominent role in the story. The allegorical yearly return of goddess Durga to slay the demon <a href="Mahishasura">Mahishasura</a> is alluded to at the end of the film. According to Uddalak Mukherjee of "The Telegraph", "Durga Puja, with its <a href="paraphernalia">paraphernalia</a> of idols, immersion processions, "<a href="pandals">pandals</a>", even an entire crowd of women draped in white "saris" with red borders, is central to the film's ... visual aesthetic." A review in Rediff.com praised the depiction of the festivities in Kolkata, a city well known for its celebration of Durga Puja.

Ghosh acknowledges the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's "<a href="Joi%20Baba%20Felunath%20%28film%29">Joi Baba Felunath</a>" (1979). In an interview with "The Telegraph", Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's "<a href="Charulata">Charulata</a>" (1964), where the actress <a href="Madhabi%20Mukherjee">Madhabi Mukherjee</a> enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also acknowledges the influence of "<a href="Mahanagar">Mahanagar</a>" (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's "<a href="Nayak%20%281966%20film%29">Nayak</a>" (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's "<a href="Aranyer%20Dinratri">Aranyer Dinratri</a>" (1970) in which Ray "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become "like Vidya's fellow passenger."

Besides Ray's films, Ghosh also admits inspiration from what he calls "visually striking" films of the 1970s and 1980s, such as "<a href="Deewaar">Deewaar</a>" (1975). Critics have compared the fake-pregnancy twist of "Kahaani" with the 2004 American psychological thriller "<a href="Taking%20Lives%20%28film%29">Taking Lives</a>". The sequences towards the end that explain the missing pieces of the mystery were compared with "<a href="The%20Usual%20Suspects">The Usual Suspects</a>" (1995). Ghosh writes that the film was heavily influenced by the colour scheme of the "Pratima Visarjan", a c.1915 watercolour by the <a href="Bengal%20School%20of%20Art">Bengal School</a> artist <a href="Gaganendranath%20Tagore">Gaganendranath Tagore</a>.

The musical score was composed by <a href="Vishal%E2%80%93Shekhar">Vishal–Shekhar</a>, and the lyrics for the film's six songs were written by Vishal Dadlani, Anvita Dutt and Sandeep Srivastava. Several of <a href="R.%20D.%20Burman">R. D. Burman</a>'s Hindi and Bengali compositions were used in the background. An album of the music was released on 22 February 2012 and subsequently on the <a href="Music%20download">digital music</a> platform <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> India since its inception from mid-2012.

The soundtrack received positive reviews, and was praised for its amalgamation of Bengali and Hindi lyrics. A review in <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a> states that the song "Ami Shotti Bolchi" is able to partially convey the feel of Kolkata, and that the soundtrack "features right voices with the overall mood of the album". "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>" rated the album with 3 stars out of 5. Reviewing the soundtrack for <a href="Indiatimes">Indiatimes</a>, Anand Vaishnav commented that ""Kahaani", as an album, stays honest to the theme of the film".

"Kahaani"s first-look poster was launched on 2 December 2011, and the official trailer on 5 January 2012. The poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan and lacking any romantic element, was well received. Critics' expectations were low, owing to the director's previous box-office failures. Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and mingled with the public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him. Social-networking website <a href="Ibibo">Ibibo</a>.com developed an online game, "The Great Indian Parking Wars", which required players to park Vidya's taxi on a street; it was well-received, reaching 50,000 hits in 10 days.
On 5 March 2012, prior to release, Kolkata Metro authorities objected to a scene in which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers.

"Kahaani" was released on 9 March 2012, a day after <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a>. It played on 1100 screens worldwide. CNN-IBN reported that although "Kahaani" was ready before "The Dirty Picture", distributors deferred its release, fearing that Vidya's role of a sexy siren (in "The Dirty Picture") after that of a pregnant woman might not be received well. <a href="Star%20India">STAR TV</a> bought the exclusive right to broadcast the film for a price of , which was the highest-ever price paid for a female-centric film in India. The Indian television premiere of the film was on <a href="STAR%20%28India%29">Star India's</a> channel <a href="Movies%20OK">Movies OK</a> on 3 June 2012. The DVD of the film was released on 17 May 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by <a href="Shemaroo%20Entertainment">Shemaroo Entertainment</a>, it contained additional content, such as behind-the-scene footage, video of celebration parties after its theatrical release, and music videos of the songs of the film. The <a href="VCD">VCD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> versions were released at the same time.

"Kahaani" garnered generally positive reviews from critics. According to review aggregator "Review Gang" the film received a rating of 7.5 out of 10, based on the reviews by professional critics. Good <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a> publicity played a part in its popularity besides the positive reviews. "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" called the film "a mind-juggling medley of manipulation masquerading as a 'mother of a story'". <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and praised Vidya's acting. "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" commented "Once again, a 'pregnant' Vidya, ironically displays more 'male ornaments' ... than most heroes." The reviews in <a href="Rediff">Rediff</a>, <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo Asian News Service</a>, CNN-IBN, Zee News, "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>", and "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" were unanimously positive, and noted script, direction, cinematography, and acting as strong points of the film. Noted film actress and multiple <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Award</a> winner <a href="Shabana%20Azmi">Shabana Azmi</a> lauded Vidya for her performance,"As an actor, I could see she [Vidya] was making all the right moves throughout the film. There was not a single artificial note in her performance." Russell Edwards, the reviewer for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", praised the cast, cinematography, and direction, and commented that despite occasional glitches, the "adroit thriller ... maintains momentum and credibility."

Many reviewers criticised the film's climax and certain features, feeling that they deviated from its general style. Rituparna Chatterjee of CNN-IBN noted that the climax of the film was a "huge dampener" and explained, "The diabolic twist at that juncture got underplayed ... What follows is a sobfest ... the apologetic explanation of why she does what she does. Justifying her action comes across more as an effort to appease the Indian morality". The "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" review noted, "At times, "Kahaani" is too clever, at others extremely pedestrian like in the depiction of computer hacking and IB operations, not to speak of the ludicrous terrorist angle and the all-too predictable Durga Puja setting for that mythology tie-in." It adds that the "spoon-feeding" of reasons at the end dampens the intrigue factor. The review in <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a> India comments that the Durga metaphor at the end was enforced, and that the film over-indulged in Bengali stereotypes. Gautaman Bhaskaran, in his review in "Gulf Times", noted that the sometimes-handheld photography was "as irksome as the plot with a sleuth too many and cops galore."

Though "Kahaani" received critical acclaim, it was a slow starter at the box office, opening to a poor response on the first day, but gradually picking afterwards. According to "The Telegraph", the film earned almost from the state of West Bengal within the first three days of its release. At <a href="Multiplex%20%28movie%20theater%29">multiplexes</a> in Kolkata, occupancy increased from 47% on Friday 9 March, the day of release, to 77% on 10 March and to around 97% on 11 March. <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a>, a website on Indian film trade, reported that the film collected nearly in its first week, well beyond its production cost of . It grossed in second week to make a two-week total of around in India; this led Box Office India to declare the film a "Super Hit". The film was successful in the international box office as well, garnering within 10 days of its release in seven markets—UK, US, UAE, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Pakistan, according to Bollywood Hungama, a film-related website. By the third week, according to CNN-IBN, it had grossed , including India and overseas market. "Hindustan Times" reported that "Kahaani" made a worldwide gross of within 50 days of its release.

"Kahaani" was nominated for, and won, many awards. The <a href="58th%20Filmfare%20Awards">58th Filmfare Awards</a> nominated the film for six of their categories, where it won five, including Best Actress for Vidya and Best Director for Ghosh. "Kahaani" received thirteen nominations at the <a href="Screen%20Awards">19th Colors Screen Awards</a>, and won five, including Best Actress and Best Story. At the <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Awards">14th Zee Cine Awards</a>, "Kahaani" won five awards, including Best Film (Critics) and Best Actress (Critics), out of fifteen nominations. At the 2013 <a href="Stardust%20Awards">Stardust Awards</a> ceremony, "Kahaani" was announced Hottest Film of the Year while Vidya received for the <a href="Stardust%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Thriller%20or%20Action">Best Actress in a Thriller or Action</a>. "Kahaani" was awarded the Most Entertaining Film of the Year at the 3rd ceremony of the <a href="BIG%20Star%20Entertainment%20Awards">BIG Star Entertainment Awards</a>. At the <a href="60th%20National%20Film%20Awards">60th National Film Awards</a>, Ghosh won <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Best Screenplay (Original)</a>, Namrata Rao won <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Editing">Best Editing</a>, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui won a Special Jury award.

Following "Kahaani"s success, Kolkata became a preferred destination for <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> filmmakers. They felt the landscapes of Mumbai and Delhi were overused for several decades, while Kolkata retained its unique visuals such as <a href="metro%20train">metro train</a>s, rickety trams, <a href="Pulled%20rickshaw">hand-pulled rickshaws</a>, dingy bylanes, palatial mansions, dilapidated houses of North Kolkata, roadside eateries, ghats of river Ganga, British-era buildings, restaurants and iconic structures and areas including Howrah Bridge, Kalighat Temple, Nakhoda Mosque, Kumortuli idol-making district and <a href="Victoria%20Memorial%20%28India%29">Victoria Memorial</a>.

Monalisa Guest House, the lodge which hosted Vidya Bagchi in the film, became a local attraction. Several hundreds have visited it since the film's release, to the extent that the owners planned to increase tariffs and renovate the rooms around a "Kahaani" theme.

The potbellied contract killer Bob Biswas became an <a href="Internet%20phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a>, the subject of several jokes and pieces of <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>, which circulated through <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>. "Nomoshkar, Aami Bob Biswas... Ek minute?" ("Hello, I am Bob Biswas... do you have a minute?")—the monologue he repeatedly uses just before murdering his victims—was used in different <a href="internet%20meme">memes</a>. A <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> and a television show based on Bob Biswas were being planned, .

Two remakes of "Kahaani" were released in 2014: a Telugu remake titled "<a href="Anaamika%20%282014%20film%29">Anaamika</a>", and its Tamil version "Nee Enge En Anbe", both directed by <a href="Sekhar%20Kammula">Sekhar Kammula</a> and featuring <a href="Nayantara">Nayantara</a> as the lead character. An English-language remake, entitled "Deity", will be directed by the <a href="Cinema%20of%20Denmark">Danish</a> director <a href="Niels%20Arden%20Oplev">Niels Arden Oplev</a> and produced by Yashraj Films, with production scheduled to begin in 2015.

In March 2012, Sujoy Ghosh announced that he intended to develop "Kahaani" into a series. He was inspired by Satyajit Ray's "<a href="Feluda">Feluda</a>" detective series and wanted to continue the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines, with Vidya Balan reprising the role. The shooting of "Kahaani 2" was scheduled to begin in 2013, but in July 2013 differences arose between Sujoy Ghosh and other co-producers. In February 2014, Vidya announced that the sequel was not happening due to these differences, but two years later, Ghosh confirmed that the film was in pre-production with Vidya set to reprise her role. The sequel, entitled "<a href="Kahaani%202">Kahaani 2</a>", began filming in March 2016 with Vidya and <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a> in lead roles, and was released on 2 December 2016.

The Ecstatic

The Ecstatic is the fourth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American rapper <a href="Mos%20Def">Mos Def</a>. It was released on June 9, 2009, by <a href="Downtown%20Records">Downtown Records</a>.

After venturing further away from <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> with an acting career and two poorly received albums, Mos Def signed a recording contract with Downtown and recorded "The Ecstatic" primarily at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a> in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, <a href="Mr.%20Flash">Mr. Flash</a>, <a href="Oh%20No%20%28rapper%29">Oh No</a>, and <a href="Madlib">Madlib</a>, the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on <a href="Stones%20Throw%20Records">Stones Throw Records</a>. Singer <a href="Georgia%20Anne%20Muldrow">Georgia Anne Muldrow</a>, formerly of the record label, was one of the album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers <a href="Slick%20Rick">Slick Rick</a> and <a href="Talib%20Kweli">Talib Kweli</a>. For its front cover, a still from <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28director%29">Charles Burnett</a>'s 1978 film "<a href="Killer%20of%20Sheep">Killer of Sheep</a>" was reproduced in red tint.

The album has been described by music journalists as a <a href="conscious%20hip%20hop">conscious</a> and <a href="alternative%20hip%20hop">alternative hip hop</a> record with an eccentric, internationalist quality. Mos Def's raps about global politics, love, spirituality, and social conditions are informed by the <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of the late <a href="2000s%20%28decade%29">2000s</a>, Black <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internalionalism</a>, and <a href="Pan-Islamic">Pan-Islamic</a> ideas, incorporating a number of Islamic references throughout the album. Its loosely structured, lightly <a href="reverberation">reverbed</a> songs use unconventional <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s and <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> taken from a variety of international musical styles, including <a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a>, <a href="Soul%20music">soul</a>, <a href="Eurodance">Eurodance</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a>, and <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20music">Middle Eastern music</a>. Mos Def titled "The Ecstatic" after one of his favorite novels, the 2002 <a href="Victor%20LaValle">Victor LaValle</a> book, believing its titular phrase evoked his singular creative vision for the album.

"The Ecstatic" charted at number nine on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> in its first week of release and eventually sold 168,000 copies. Its sales benefited from its presence on Internet blogs and the release of a T-shirt illustrating the record's packaging alongside a label printed with a code redeemable for a free download of the album. A widespread critical success, "The Ecstatic" was viewed as a return to form for Mos Def and one of the year's best albums. He embarked on an international tour to support the record, performing concerts in North America, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom between September and April 2010. As his <a href="disc%20jockey">DJ</a> on the tour, Preservation began to develop remixes of the album's songs, which he later released on the <a href="remix%20album">remix album</a> "The REcstatic" in 2013.

In 2006, Mos Def's third album "<a href="True%20Magic">True Magic</a>" was released haphazardly by <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a> to fulfill a contractual obligation while he was devoting more time to his acting career. The quality of the album, along with his repeated ventures away from <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> in his music, left "some fans wondering if Mos Def's acting accomplishments were finally affecting his music", "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" critic Quentin B. Huff later wrote. Speaking with <a href="Spank%20Rock">Spank Rock</a> for "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine, Mos Def elucidated his artistic endeavors at the time: "You have to experience life, make observations, ask questions. It's machine-like how things are run in hip-hop now, and my ambitions are different ... To me the job of an artist is to provide a useful and intelligent vocabulary for the world to be able to articulate feelings they experience every day." After ending his tenure on Geffen, he signed a record deal with <a href="Downtown%20Records">Downtown Records</a> before recording "The Ecstatic" as his first album for the label.

"The Ecstatic" was mostly recorded in sessions at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a> in Los Angeles; the songs "Twilight Speedball", "No Hay Nada Mas", and "Roses" were partially recorded at Hovercraft Studios in Virginia Beach, Someothaship Connect in Los Angeles, and New York City's <a href="Downtown%20Music%20Studios">Downtown Music Studios</a>.

Mos Def worked with producers <a href="Mr.%20Flash">Mr. Flash</a>, <a href="Oh%20No%20%28rapper%29">Oh No</a>, <a href="Madlib">Madlib</a>, and Preservation, who previously produced some of "True Magic"s songs. For "The Ecstatic", Oh No reused some of his productions from his 2007 album "<a href="Dr.%20No%27s%20Oxperiment">Dr. No's Oxperiment</a>", while Madlib incorporated samples from his "<a href="Beat%20Konducta">Beat Konducta in India</a>" (2007) record. For "Life in Marvelous Times", Mr. Flash reused the beat from "Champions"—his 2006 collaboration with the French hip hop group <a href="TTC%20%28band%29">TTC</a>—while "History" used a beat produced by <a href="J%20Dilla">J Dilla</a> before his death. With Preservation, Mos Def produced "Casa Bey" after a 2006 trip to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, where local rapper <a href="MV%20Bill">MV Bill</a> introduced him to the music of <a href="Banda%20Black%20Rio">Banda Black Rio</a>. Mos Def and Preservation altered one of the band's songs—"Casa Forte", an instrumental featuring their characteristic blend of <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, and <a href="Music%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian rhythms</a>—and used it as the beat. The original song title—meaning "strong house" in Portuguese—was changed to "Casa Bey"; Bey was Mos Def's family surname. According to him, he tried to enlist rappers <a href="Jay%20Electronica">Jay Electronica</a>, <a href="Black%20Thought">Black Thought</a>, and <a href="David%20Jude%20Jolicoeur">Trugoy</a> for the song, but they all found it too difficult to rap over the instrumental.

Mos Def collaborated with singer <a href="Georgia%20Anne%20Muldrow">Georgia Anne Muldrow</a> and rappers <a href="Slick%20Rick">Slick Rick</a> and <a href="Talib%20Kweli">Talib Kweli</a>—his partner in the rap duo <a href="Black%20Star%20%28rap%20duo%29">Black Star</a>. Muldrow sang and played piano on "Roses", which she originally wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album "Umsindo" (2009). She said Mos Def "borrowed" the song for "The Ecstatic" after they met through a mutual friend. "They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. He snatched it up real quick", she recalled in laughter. Along with Madlib, Oh No, and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of <a href="Stones%20Throw%20Records">Stones Throw Records</a>; according to journalist <a href="Nathan%20Rabin">Nathan Rabin</a>, they collectively produced half of the album, giving its sound a "sympathetic" quality. With "The Ecstatic", Mos Def said he wanted to offer listeners sincere, uninhibited observations about life and love, "some truth and positive heart lift", without the need for club songs. "No disrespect to [the club]".

"The Ecstatic" covers an international range of styles in a very loose and extemporaneous manner, held together by what Rabin described as "a lyrical and sonic fascination with life beyond the Western World". According to <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, the album's songs generally average two-and-a-half minutes and segue into one another without <a href="resolution%20%28music%29">resolution</a>, giving it the feel of a globally influenced hip hop <a href="mixtape">mixtape</a>, "with poles in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> and <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>". The record reflected Mos Def's varied interests in <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, poetry, <a href="Eastern%20music">Eastern</a> rhythms, <a href="psychedelia">psychedelia</a>, <a href="Spanish%20music">Spanish music</a>, and the <a href="blues">blues</a>. The tracks on the first half were described by "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"s Ben Thompson as "predominantly eastward-looking" while the second half indulged more in <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a> and <a href="reggae">reggae</a> influences. Other sounds sampled or explored included <a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a> ("Quiet Dog Bite Hard"), <a href="Eurodance">Eurodance</a> ("Life in Marvelous Times"), <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> ("Supermagic"), and <a href="Philadelphia%20soul">Philadelphia soul</a>. "Supermagic" also drew on elements from Turkish <a href="acid%20rock">acid rock</a> and "<a href="Mary%20Poppins">Mary Poppins</a>", while on "No Hay Nada Mas", Mos Def sang and rapped in Spanish over a <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a>-influenced production. He sang elsewhere on the album, often breaking into sing-song <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamps</a> during his raps. Along with Mos Def's singing, the predominantly sample-based music was unconventional in its use of what Preservation said were unusual <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s and "awkward" <a href="breakdown%20%28music%29">breakdowns</a>.

According to "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>"s Simmy Richman, "The Ecstatic"s Eastern-influenced musical backdrop was reflective of Mos Def's "post-<a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a>" themes; Richman called it a <a href="conscious%20rap">conscious rap</a> record, and "No Ripcord"s Ryan Faughnder regarded the music as "socially conscious alternative hip-hop". Mos Def incorporated a number of Islamic references onto the album, including samples of American Muslim activist <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, Turkish protest singer <a href="Selda%20Ba%C4%9Fcan">Selda Bağcan</a>, and an Arab-language scene from the 1966 film "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Algiers">The Battle of Algiers</a>"; additionally, the track "Wahid" was titled after the Arabic word for "oneness". African-American studies and media scholar Sohail Daulatzai believed "The Ecstatic" was informed by Black <a href="Internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalist politics</a> and <a href="Pan-Islamic">Pan-Islamic</a> ideas, while "<a href="State%20%28magazine%29">State</a>" magazine's Niall Byrne said it explored the theme of <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a> on songs such as the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20music">Middle Eastern</a>-influenced "The Embassy" and "Auditorium", which featured an <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>-themed guest rap by Slick Rick. On the former track, Mos Def rapped from the perspective of an outsider about the lifestyle of an <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a> at a luxury hotel, while the opening song "Supermagic" critiqued government treatment of <a href="minority%20groups">minority groups</a>.

As on Mos Def's other albums, he spoke a dedication to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") at the start of "The Ecstatic", before "Supermagic" began with a sample of Malcolm X's 1964 speech at <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>. The sample prefaced the album's "small-globe statement", "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>" believed the speech introduced "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the <a href="Barack%20Obama">Obama</a>-era zeitgeist as in accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s <a href="Bedford%E2%80%93Stuyvesant%2C%20Brooklyn">Bedford–Stuyvesant</a> setting of "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such as a Black man being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality". From Christgau's perspective, Mos Def offered a <a href="credo">credo</a> in the lyrics: "More of less than ever before / It's just too much more for your mind to absorb / It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt / We can't be alive in no time but now".

Throughout "The Ecstatic", Mos Def alternated between what <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Andy Kellman called nonsensical yet intellectual raps and "seemingly nonchalant, off-the-cuff boasts", set against eccentric, lightly <a href="reverberation">reverbed</a> productions. According to "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Paul MacInnes, "The Ecstatic" featured his characteristically "fragmented lyrical style, which looped words within phrases and played on sound as much as meaning". "Auditorium" showcased his "complex and convoluted" lyricism <a href="flow%20%28music%29">delivered</a> closely in rhythm with the beat, Patrin said, citing the lines "soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren / I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant / chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided". He explored <a href="Afrocentricism">Afrocentric</a> themes on "Revelations" and compared love to a gunfight on "Pistola". On "Roses", Muldrow sang <a href="Environmentally%20friendly">nature-friendly</a> lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. "Roses is about creativity and human capacity", she explained. "A lot of times Western society makes [women] base our sense of worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how you prove your love to somebody ... but you receive so many gifts and still feel empty. So draw them and let the roses come from inside."

"The Ecstatic" was titled after <a href="Victor%20LaValle">Victor LaValle</a>'s 2002 <a href="Black%20comedy">dark humor</a> novel. One of Mos Def's favorite novels, it was written about an overweight college dropout who fell into mental illness while living with his eccentric family in <a href="Queens%2C%20New%20York">Queens, New York</a>. According to Mos Def, the phrase "the ecstatic" was "used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe people who were either mad or divinely inspired and consequently dismissed as kooks". The phrase resonated with him, as he believed no one else in hip hop had ever recorded an album like "The Ecstatic". "I feel like I was the only person who was capable of making this type of music in this type of way", he claimed. "I don't rap like nobody, I don't try to sound like nobody." He said "the ecstatic" also referred to "a type of devotional energy, an impossible dream that becomes reality but is discredited before it's realized. The airplane, a nutty idea. The telephone, the Internet. People who envisioned those were considered radical or extreme."

"The Ecstatic" was packaged with few <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> and a two-sheet booklet featuring a photo of Mos Def taken using the <a href="Photo%20Booth">Photo Booth</a> software application. The front cover photo reproduced a still in red tint from "<a href="Killer%20of%20Sheep">Killer of Sheep</a>", a low-budget 1978 film by <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28director%29">Charles Burnett</a> about African-American life in 1970s <a href="Watts%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Watts, Los Angeles</a>. According to Dale Eisinger from "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>", the "subtle and still-moving" front cover photo reflected the ideas of cultural justice and global inequality present throughout Mos Def's career while capturing the "sonic construction" of "The Ecstatic"s music. "The cover has hazy, dream-like movement", Eisinger said, "appearing as a non-narrative, loose collection of vignettes that are tangentially fascinating and incredibly powerful." For the back cover, a 1928 photo of the <a href="Moorish%20Science%20Temple">Moorish Science Temple</a> gathering in Chicago was used, which Daulatzai interpreted as another element of Mos Def's "Pan-Islamic mashup" on the album.

"The Ecstatic" was released by Downtown on June 9, 2009. In its first week, the album sold 39,000 copies and debuted at number nine on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, becoming the second record of Mos Def's career to reach the top 10 on the chart. The following week, he became the first recording artist to endorse the Original Music Tee, a T-shirt featuring the album cover on the front, the track listing on the back, and a tag with a code to download an <a href="MP3">MP3</a> copy of the record. The marketing strategy led to enough sales that "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" factored the T-shirts as album units on <a href="Billboard%20charts">the magazine's music charts</a>. "The Ecstatic" also benefited from the number of mentions it received on Internet <a href="blog">blog</a> posts, which peaked during the week of June 29. The album reached 168,000 copies sold in March 2014.

Three <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released to promote the album: "Life in Marvelous Times" on November 4, 2008; "Quiet Dog Bite Hard" on January 13, 2009; and "Casa Bey" on May 26. According to <a href="Charles%20Aaron">Charles Aaron</a>, "Life in Marvelous Times" was the "most powerful and accessible song" Mos Def had ever recorded, but it could not even manage to receive airplay on radio stations in his native New York. "If [it] can't get on the radio, then I don't need to be on the radio", the rapper said in August, expressing a wavering interest in reaching mainstream audiences. 

At the month's start, Mos Def embarked on the North American leg of The Ecstatic Tour, performing venues in a number of US and Canadian cities including Chicago, Miami, Washington D.C., Miami, Portland, Calgary, and Vancouver. It featured Jay Electronica as his <a href="opening%20act">opening act</a>, and certain shows were <a href="Headliner%20%28performances%29">co-headlined</a> with Kweli and singer <a href="Erykah%20Badu">Erykah Badu</a>. The leg concluded on October 3 with an evening performance slot at the <a href="Austin%20City%20Limits%20Music%20Festival">Austin City Limits Music Festival</a>. Mos Def continued touring into the following year, playing a series of concerts in Japan during late 2009, which were documented in an episode of the <a href="Current%20TV">Current TV</a> series "Embedded". This was followed by his first headlining tour of Australia in January 2010 and a short series of April concerts in the United Kingdom.

"The Ecstatic" was met with widespread critical acclaim. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an <a href="weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">average</a> score of 81, based on 28 reviews. After two poorly received records, it was viewed by critics as a return to the form of his 1999 debut album "<a href="Black%20on%20Both%20Sides">Black on Both Sides</a>", earning some of the best reviews of his career.

In "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", "The Ecstatic" was hailed as Mos Def's "most conceptually knotty and ambitious work", while Aaron wrote in "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" that the "internationalist return to form" was also "perhaps his liveliest work". For "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>", <a href="Jim%20Carroll%20%28journalist%29">Jim Carroll</a> said the rapper had not performed this engagingly or skillfully since his career beginnings, highlighting especially "Supermagic" and "Life in Marvelous Times". Mick Middles from "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" appraised it as "the joyful sound of a rampant artist, unrestrained by expectation or commercialism", with free-flowing music that escaped the boundaries his previous albums had merely pushed. Thompson believed the diverse range of samples made it "a crate-digger's wet dream" and "a thrillingly accessible demonstration of hip-hop's limitless creative possibilities" to a layperson. Writing in "<a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a>", Christgau felt the songs were "devoid of <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a> but full of sounds you want to hear again", along with "thoughtfully slurred" yet intelligible lyrics by Mos Def, whose creative vision warranted the introductory Malcolm X sample. In the opinion of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s <a href="Josh%20Tyrangiel">Josh Tyrangiel</a>, his political meditations may not appeal to <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservatives</a> but are rich in "the rhythm, exuberance and wit Mos Def showed on his early records". Steve Jones of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" said his reflections on politics, love, religion, and societal conditions were full of insight and sincerity while calling the album his strongest effort.

Some reviewers were less impressed. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" critic Christian Hoard found the quality of the songs inconsistent, while "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Eric Henderon claimed much of the music lacked <a href="song%20structure">song structure</a> and "careened wildly, free from the constraints of chorus and verse". Margaret Wappler evaluated the record with qualified praise in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", saying it "mostly lives up to its giddy name" but wanes occasionally while the artful samples may challenge listeners at first.

At the end of 2009, "The Ecstatic" was named one of the year's 10 best albums; according to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, it was the 24th most prominently ranked record on critics' year-end lists. The album was ranked 30th by "The Guardian", 24th by "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>", 23rd by "Slant Magazine", 17th by "Rolling Stone", 16th by <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a>, 15th by "PopMatters", 12th by "<a href="Spex%20%28magazine%29">Spex</a>", 10th by "<a href="Relevant%20%28magazine%29">Relevant</a>", 7th by "Spin", and 3rd by <a href="eMusic">eMusic</a>; <a href="About.com">About.com</a> and <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a> both named it the year's best rap record. In "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>—an annual poll of American critics nationwide—"The Ecstatic" was voted the 11th best album of 2009. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 12th on his own year-end list for "<a href="The%20Barnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble%20Review">The Barnes & Noble Review</a>". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" placed it at number 30 on the newspaper's decade-end list of the 100 greatest records from the 2000s. It finished at numbers 27 and 155 on similar lists published by <a href="Napster%20%28streaming%20music%20service%29">Rhapsody</a> and <a href="Rock%27s%20Backpages">Rock's Backpages</a>, respectively. It was also nominated for a <a href="52nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2010 Grammy Award</a> in the category of <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap%20Album">Best Rap Album</a>, while "Casa Bey" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap%20Solo%20Performance">Best Rap Solo Performance</a>. In 2013, "<a href="Beats%20Per%20Minute%20%28website%29">Beats Per Minute</a>" named "The Ecstatic" the 112th best album of the past five years.

Between January 30 and February 6, 2010, the HVW8 Art & Design Gallery in Los Angeles held an exclusive one-week exhibition titled "Mos Def: Ecstatic Moments – Photographs". It showcased a collection of photos taken by Cognito—a longtime hip hop documentarian and colleague of Mos Def—capturing the rapper during the two years spent making and promoting "The Ecstatic". Included in the exhibition were <a href="candid%20photograph">candid photograph</a>s of him in the studio with the album's producers, and photos of his experiences visiting and touring locations around the world, including the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>. A series of "posse shots" taken at the end of concerts from the American tour were also displayed, showing the rapper with Jay Electronica, Kweli, Badu, and musician <a href="Shuggie%20Otis">Shuggie Otis</a>, who made an unexpected appearance during the tour.

The timing of the exhibition was meant to capitalize on Mos Def's two nominations for the Grammy Awards, which were being held that week, Cognito explained: "I thought it was a perfect time to honor his presence while he's here. We've had a lot of our greats pass away in the past couple of years, be it Dilla or <a href="Slum%20Village">Bataan</a> ["<a href="sic">sic</a>"], or whoever, and now everybody wants to talk 'Dilla Dilla Dilla' or whatever, but you weren't saying that while he was alive. Let's praise our heroes while they're alive."

While on tour as Mos Def's in-concert <a href="disc%20jockey">DJ</a>, Preservation began to <a href="remix">remix</a> some of "The Ecstatic"s songs for their live routine. He challenged himself to remix the rest of the record, taking more than a year, as a project called "The REcstatic", working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing engineer</a>. Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes. He wanted them to be sample-based and consistent in <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a>, <a href="pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a>, and <a href="musical%20tone">tone</a> to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. "It's the result of countless hours of digging through records to sample", he recalled. "Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on". "Black Fantastic", an outtake produced by Minnesota during "The Ecstatic"s recording, replaced "Casa Bey" in the final track listing, as Preservation had found the tempo and structure of the original song too difficult to make a satisfactory remix.

"The REcstatic" was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's <a href="imprint%20label">imprint label</a>, Mon Dieu Music. Reviewing the <a href="remix%20album">remix album</a> in "<a href="Tiny%20Mix%20Tapes">Tiny Mix Tapes</a>", Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a "slightly rougher texture" on what he deemed "a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that can be said for very few modern rap 'remixes'".

Operation Perch

Operation Perch was a British offensive of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> which took place from 7 to 14 June 1944, during the early stages of the Battle of Normandy. The operation was intended to encircle and seize the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> occupied city of <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, which was a <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> objective for the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 3rd Infantry Division</a> in the early phases of <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>. Operation Perch was to begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a>. Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and the operation was amended. The operation was expanded to include <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I Corps</a> for a <a href="Pincer%20movement">pincer attack</a> on Caen.

On the next day, XXX Corps in the west pushed south to <a href="Tilly-sur-Seulles">Tilly-sur-Seulles</a>, which was occupied by the and the village was captured and re-captured several times. I Corps began the eastern thrust two days later from the <a href="Orne%20%28river%29">Orne</a> bridgehead, which had been secured in <a href="Operation%20Tonga">Operation Tonga</a> on D-Day. I Corps was also delayed by constant counter-attacks of the 21st Panzer Division. With mounting casualties and no sign of a German collapse, the offensive east of Caen was suspended on 13 June.

Further west in the US <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">First Army</a> area, American attacks forced a gap in the German defences. Part of the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 7th Armoured Division</a> was diverted from Tilly-sur-Seulles, to advance through the gap in a <a href="flanking%20manoeuvre">flanking manoeuvre</a> and force the Panzer Lehr Division to fall back, to avoid encirclement. On 14 June, after two days of battle including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Villers-Bocage">Battle of Villers-Bocage</a>, the 7th Armoured Division was ordered to withdraw towards Caumont. Plans were made to resume the offensive once the 7th Armoured Division had been reinforced but the plans came to nothing when a storm in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> seriously delayed the landing of supplies and reinforcements.

The battle is controversial because many historians and writers have concluded that it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To resist the offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a>.

The Norman town of Caen was a D-Day objective for the 3rd Infantry Division, which landed on <a href="Sword%20Beach">Sword Beach</a> on 6 June 1944. The capture of Caen was the most ambitious objective of I Corps (<a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="John%20Crocker">John Crocker</a>). The Overlord plan called for the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Army</a> (Lieutenant-General <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a>) to secure the city and then form a front line from <a href="Caumont-l%27%C3%89vent%C3%A9">Caumont-l'Éventé</a> to the south-east of Caen, acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the US First Army while it moved on <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>, which could be used as the pivot for a swing left of the Allied front to advance on <a href="Argentan">Argentan</a> and then towards the <a href="Touques%20River">Touques River</a>. The terrain between Caen and <a href="Vimont%2C%20Calvados">Vimont</a> was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. The Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units and a battle of manoeuvre would be to their advantage.

Operation Perch was intended to create the threat of a British break-out to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps. The <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Infantry%20Division">50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division</a> landed on <a href="Gold%20Beach">Gold Beach</a> on 6 June and was to rapidly move inland and capture Bayeux and the road to Tilly-sur-Seulles. The 7th Armoured Division and the <a href="8th%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">8th Armoured Brigade</a> would then take over from the 50th Northumbrian Division and advance from Tilly-sur-Seulles to <a href="Mont%20Pin%C3%A7on">Mont Pinçon</a>. XXX Corps landed on Gold Beach at 07:30 on 6 June, cleared seven exits off the beach and advanced inland. German resistance at Le Hamel delayed the division and prevented the achievement of all of the D-Day objectives before dark. Patrols had reached <a href="Bayeux">Bayeux</a> and made contact with the <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Division">3rd Canadian Infantry Division</a>, which had landed on <a href="Juno%20Beach">Juno Beach</a> to the east. The <a href="No.%2047%20%28Royal%20Marine%29%20Commando">47 Royal Marine Commando</a> advanced westwards along the coast, to link up with the American forces moving inland from <a href="Omaha%20Beach">Omaha Beach</a> but fell short of <a href="Port-en-Bessin-Huppain">Port-en-Bessin-Huppain</a> by .

During the afternoon, the German <a href="LXXXIV%20Corps">LXXXIV Corps</a> ordered its reserve, "<a href="Kampfgruppe%20Meyer">Kampfgruppe Meyer</a>", to strike into the flank of the 50th Division north of Bayeux. While advancing to the attack, a battalion was ordered towards Omaha beach, weakening the counter-attack which was a costly failure. On 7 June, the bulk of the 7th Armoured Division landed on schedule and XXX Corps secured its remaining D-Day objectives, including Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin-Huppain. The LXXXIV Corps sent its last reserve unit, Mobile Brigade 30, towards Gold Beach to repeat the counter-attack, which also failed and the brigade was destroyed north of Bayeux. The survivors of the two counter-attacks were driven into a pocket north of the city by the Anglo-American advance, although the Americans did not discover that this had happened. From Sword Beach, the 3rd Infantry Division of I Corps had advanced towards Caen but diverted units to capture German positions along the route, which reduced the strength of the infantry attack and the accompanying <a href="27th%20Armoured%20Brigade">27th Armoured Brigade</a> was delayed by congestion in the beachhead. The division was stopped short of Caen by the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division</a>.

On 9 June the Allied ground forces commander, General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, met Dempsey and <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> (US First Army commander) and it was decided that Caen would be taken by a pincer movement, Operation Wild Oats. From the east the <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st (Highland) Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20and%20Headquarters%20North%20East">4th Armoured Brigade</a> of I Corps, would cross east into the <a href="6th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Airborne Division</a> bridgehead over the Orne and attack towards <a href="Cagny%2C%20Calvados">Cagny</a>, to the south-east of Caen. XXX Corps to the west would send the 7th Armoured Division across the <a href="Odon%20River">Odon River</a> to take <a href="%C3%89vrecy">Évrecy</a> and Hill 112. The <a href="1st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Airborne Division</a> would then drop between the pincers but <a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal">Air Chief Marshal</a> <a href="Trafford%20Leigh-Mallory">Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory</a>, the Allied air commander exercised a veto of the airborne plan as too risky for the transport aircraft.

Late on 7 June, the <a href="I%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">I SS-Panzer Corps</a> was transferred from the command of the <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a> to <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army">"Panzergruppe West"</a> (Armoured Group West, General <a href="Geyr%20von%20Schweppenburg">Geyr von Schweppenburg</a>). Field Marshal <a href="Gerd%20von%20Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a>, the supreme commander in the west (<a href="OB%20West">OB West</a>), ordered to plan a counter-attack for 10 June. This attack was cancelled by Field Marshal <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> the commander of <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a>, due to lack of troops. German units were rushed to Normandy to contain the invasion. The I SS-Panzer Corps consisted of the <a href="Panzer-Lehr-Division">Panzer-Lehr-Division</a>, one of the strongest divisions in the German army, the <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hitlerjugend">12th SS-Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend"</a> and the 21st Panzer Division. The leading elements of the Panzer-Lehr Division arrived during the night of 9 June at the Tilly-sur-Seulles, having lost up to 200 vehicles to aerial attacks during its drive from <a href="Chartres">Chartres</a>, having been diverted from facing the British I Corps north of Caen due to the success of the 50th Northumbrian Division. Parts of the 12th SS-Panzer Division, the 21st Panzer Division and the remains of the <a href="716th%20Static%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">716th Static Infantry Division</a> were moved to Caen, facing I Corps. Several attacks were launched against the Anglo-Canadian beachhead north of Caen. In the early hours of 9 June, the survivors of and Mobile Brigade 30 broke out of the pocket north of Bayeux. Later in the day, XXX Corps linked with the Americans while the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division reached the north-east outskirts of Tilly-sur-Seulles and encountered the tanks of the Panzer-Lehr Division. During the evening, Panzer-Lehr and the 12th SS-Panzer Division counter-attacked and overran a British infantry company, before being forced back the next morning.

On 10 June, the 7th Armoured Division took over parts of the 50th Northumbrian Division front with the <a href="56th%20Infantry%20Brigade">56th Infantry Brigade</a> under command. By nightfall, the 7th Armoured Division had reached the north-western fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village, capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division bogged down in the <a href="bocage">bocage</a>. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June and replace them with infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> over-ruled Rommel and the next day ordered him not to retreat and instead to roll up the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.

While XXX Corps attacked Tilly-sur-Seulles, an attack by I Corps was postponed until 12 June, because of weather delays, which slowed the landing of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade. On 10 June, German tanks and infantry made several attacks on the 6th Airborne Division in the Orne bridgehead, which forestalled the British attack. The Germans were repulsed with the help of naval gunfire and then counter-attacked; a captured German officer remarked that his "battalion had been virtually wiped out" during twelve hours of fighting. In the evening, a German attack on <a href="Ranville">Ranville</a> was repulsed with many German casualties. The vanguard of the 51st Highland Division arrived during the evening and attacked <a href="Battle%20of%20Breville">Bréville</a> at dawn, which was also a costly failure; other elements of the division quickly secured <a href="Touffr%C3%A9ville">Touffréville</a>. During the afternoon of 11 June, <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20Own%20Rifles%20of%20Canada">The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada</a> and <a href="1st%20Hussars">1st Hussars</a> attacked <a href="Le%20Mesnil-Patry">Le Mesnil-Patry</a> to assist the advance of the <a href="69th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">69th Brigade</a> of the 50th Northumbrian Division but the attack was another costly failure. On 12 June, German attacks were launched from the Bréville area against the Orne bridgehead. Fighting lasted all day and casualties were severe on both sides but during the evening the Germans pulled back. To close the gap in the British perimeter, the decision was made to secure Bréville and the 12th Battalion the Parachute Regiment captured the village by midnight but had 141 casualties among 160 men in the attack. The 51st Highland Division was opposed by the 21st Panzer Division in its efforts to push south to Saint Honorine and with the Highlanders contained, the offensive east of Caen was called off on 13 June.

Although the attempt to envelop Caen had been repulsed, on the right flank of XXX Corps (the junction of the British Second and First US armies) the possibility for a flanking manoeuvre had developed. Since D-Day, the British and Americans had destroyed five German <a href="Kampfgruppe">battle groups</a> in this area, including the reserves of LXXXIV Corps, leaving only remnants of the <a href="352nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">352nd Infantry Division</a> in the <a href="Tr%C3%A9vi%C3%A8res">Trévières</a>–<a href="Agy">Agy</a> sector. The 352nd Division had been in action since its defence of Omaha, on 6 June, and had received few replacements. The <a href="U.S.%201st%20Infantry%20Division">1st US Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="U.S.%202nd%20Infantry%20Division">2nd US Infantry Division</a> had forced the collapse of the left flank of the 352nd Division. On the night of 9/10 June, the 352nd Division received permission to retire to Saint-Lô, which created a gap in the German lines near Caumont-l'Éventé. Only the reconnaissance battalion of the <a href="17th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20G%C3%B6tz%20von%20Berlichingen">17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division</a>, which had been detached when the division was moved west ready for a counter-offensive at <a href="Carentan">Carentan</a>, remained in the area.

The Germans planned to use the <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Panzer Division</a> to plug the gap but on 10 June, the bulk of the 2nd Panzer Division was strung out between <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> and <a href="Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a> and was not expected to arrive in strength for another three days. General <a href="Hans%20Freiherr%20von%20Funck">Hans Freiherr von Funck</a> of <a href="XLVII%20Panzer%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">XLVII Panzer Corps</a> rushed the divisional reconnaissance battalion to Caumont, with orders to hold the high ground. The I SS-Panzer Corps commander, <a href="Sepp%20Dietrich">Sepp Dietrich</a>, ordered his only reserve "<a href="Schwere%20SS-Panzer-Abteilung%20101">Schwere SS-Panzer-Abteilung 101</a>", to move behind the Panzer-Lehr and 12th SS-Panzer divisions to cover the open left flank. The 2nd Company, , under the command of <a href="Michael%20Wittmann">Michael Wittmann</a> and with five operational <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger tanks</a>, was ordered to a position south of Point 213 on the Villers-Bocage ridge and arrived on 12 June, after a five-day drive from <a href="Beauvais">Beauvais</a>.
On 12 June, Dempsey met with Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall (XXX Corps) and <a href="Major-General">Major-General</a> George Erskine (7th Armoured Division) and ordered Erskine to disengage the division from the fighting around Tilly-sur-Seulles. The 7th Armoured Division was to exploit the gap to seize Villers-Bocage and advance behind the left flank of the Panzer-Lehr Division, to a ridge about east of the town. It was believed that the appearance of British tanks behind the Panzer-Lehr Division on high ground astride German supply-lines would compel the Panzer-Lehr Division to withdraw or be trapped. To support the flanking move of the 7th Armoured Division, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was to continue its attack against the Panzer-Lehr Division around Tilly-sur-Seulles. The V US Corps would push forward at the same time, the 1st US Infantry Division to capture Caumont and the high ground nearby and the 2nd US Infantry Division to advance towards Saint-Lô.

The 7th Armoured Division was slow to redeploy and spent the morning of 12 June continuing the attack on Tilly-sur-Seulles, according to its original orders. At 12:00, Erskine ordered Brigadier Hinde (commander of the 22nd Armoured Brigade) to move through the gap at once. With the <a href="131st%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">131st Infantry Brigade</a> ready for action, the 56th Infantry Brigade was returned to the control of the 50th Northumbrian Division. The 7th Armoured Division armoured reconnaissance regiment, the <a href="8th%20King%27s%20Royal%20Irish%20Hussars">8th King's Royal Irish Hussars</a>, began to reconnoitre the route and the rest of the division departed from <a href="Trungy">Trungy</a> at around 16:00. Four hours later, the main body approached <a href="Livry%2C%20Calvados">Livry</a> after an unopposed advance of , the last of which were though German-held territory.

North of Livry, the leading 8th Hussar <a href="Cromwell%20tank">Cromwell tank</a>s were knocked out by an anti-tank gun of the Panzer-Lehr Division Escort Company; infantry and tanks were brought forward and cleared the position after two hours. On reaching the vicinity of La Mulotiere, Hinde halted for the night, to disguise the objective of the advance. The Cromwells of the 8th Hussar and the <a href="11th%20Hussars">11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussar</a> (the XXX Corps <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> regiment) reconnoitred the flanks. The 11th Hussars found no resistance on the right, linking with the 1st US Infantry Division near Caumont; on the left flank, the 8th Hussars located elements of the Panzer-Lehr Division just under away.

The British advance resumed at 05:30, and at about 08:30 the vanguard of the 22nd Armoured <a href="Brigade%20group">Brigade group</a> entered the west end of Villers-Bocage. A squadron of the <a href="4th%20County%20of%20London%20Yeomanry%20%28Sharpshooters%29">4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)</a>, moved through the town and occupied Point 213, an area of high ground to the east on the Caen road. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road.

At about 09:00, the foremost British tanks were engaged by tanks of the 2nd Company, . A Tiger under the command of Michael Wittmann, entered Villers-Bocage and destroyed several tanks of the 4th County of London Yeomanry regimental headquarters and reconnaissance troop, then attacked British tanks entering the town from the west, before attempting to withdraw. The Tiger was immobilised by British return fire and was abandoned by the crew who fled towards Château Orbois to report to the Panzer-Lehr Division. In fewer than 15 minutes, two anti-tank guns and vehicles had been destroyed, many by Wittmann. During the rest of the morning, an infantry battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00, the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.
Tanks of the Panzer-Lehr Division arrived to seal off the north and west exits from Villers-Bocage but were ambushed by British anti-tank guns and several were disabled before the British position was silenced. The was ambushed in the town centre. Several Tigers and a <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> were knocked out by anti-tank guns, a <a href="Sherman%20Firefly">Sherman Firefly</a> and British infantry. The disabled tanks were later set on fire and British and German infantry fought throughout the afternoon. The British positions were bombarded by heavy artillery and several German attacks were repulsed by British field artillery firing over open sights. A British company was overrun, a platoon taken prisoner and the battalion headquarters came under fire. Hinde decided that the brigade group should withdraw until morning to Point 174, an area of high ground to the west of Villers-Bocage near <a href="Amay%C3%A9-sur-Seulles">Amayé-sur-Seulles</a>. At 20:00, the withdrawal began under cover of an artillery bombardment and was accomplished largely unmolested.

On the morning of 14 June, Montgomery abandoned the pincer attack on Caen, because he lacked "sufficient strength to act offensively on both flanks". XXX Corps was ordered to continue in a "concentrated single blow" while in the I Corps area, the attack by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was "piped down". The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division continued the attack southwards, to pin down German forces. On 14 June, supported by the divisional artillery and the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, the division attacked with two brigades towards la Senaudière, la Belle Epine, <a href="Ling%C3%A8vres">Lingèvres</a> and <a href="Verri%C3%A8res%2C%20Orne">Verrières</a>. If the attack succeeded, it was to be exploited to capture <a href="Hottot-les-Bagues">Hottot-les-Bagues</a>. To prepare the route of the attack, a <a href="Reconnaissance%23Reconnaissance-in-force">reconnaissance-in-force</a> was conducted the evening before but the "<a href="panzergrenadier">panzergrenadier</a>s" of the Panzer-Lehr Division inflicted many casualties on the British troops; German casualties are unknown, although one tank was destroyed.

The main attack began at 10:15 the next morning, when the <a href="151st%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">151st (Durham) Infantry Brigade</a> and tanks of the <a href="4th/7th%20Royal%20Dragoon%20Guards">4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards</a>, advanced towards Lingèvres and Verrières. The German defenders held their fire until the British were less than from their position. The fighting culminated with an assault by the 6th <a href="Durham%20Light%20Infantry">Durham Light Infantry</a> (DLI), with much artillery support, that captured the German positions. Two companies advanced to Verrières, which was found to be unoccupied but further advances were checked by German infantry and tanks. The 9th DLI was also held up by German machine-gun fire and needed their reserve companies, to break through the German positions. At about 13:30, the battalion captured Lingèvres and moved anti-tank guns into the village, although most of these were put out of action by the first German counter-attack.

Two <a href="Panther%20tank">Panthers</a> were spotted approaching Lingèvres by Sergeant Wilfred Harris, commander of a Sherman Firefly, who engaged at , destroying the first and disabling the second. While Harris moved, an infantry tank-hunting party, led by Major John Mogg (acting battalion commander of the 9th DLI) finished off the damaged Panther. Other tank-hunting parties drove off another Panther, a British <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> was destroyed and a third Panther was knocked out by a Sherman. Three more Panthers moved towards the village and Harris destroyed the lead vehicle outside the village and the other two inside, including one in the centre of Lingèvres. The <a href="231st%20Infantry%20Brigade">231st Infantry Brigade</a> reached its objectives by nightfall and linked with the 151st Infantry Brigade. A 6th DLI officer said that the attack was the best one launched by the battalion during the campaign. Nine German tanks were knocked out during the day but the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division had been unable to break through the Panzer-Lehr defences and the DLI suffered 

The 22nd Armoured Brigade group had completed their withdrawal by 14 June and formed a brigade box for all-round defence (with an area of fewer than ) near Hill 174. The fighting became known as The Battle of the Island or Island Position as named in the 22nd Armoured Brigade group after action report. Other names given to the action are The Battle of the Brigade Box and The Battle of Amayé-sur-Seulles.

The Panzer-Lehr Division had defended against the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division attack and to counter-attack the 7th Armoured Division penetration, with the support of the 1st Company . The 2nd Panzer Division reconnaissance battalion and other small infantry units also faced the brigade box but the tanks of the 2nd Panzer Division had still not arrived. The British 131st Infantry Brigade (one infantry battalion and an armoured regiment) had moved up to Livry. During the morning, the 131st Infantry Brigade kept the road from the brigade box to the Livry–Briquessard area open and <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Typhoon</a> fighter bombers attacked German positions near the box.

German infantry spotted advancing towards the brigade box were bombarded by heavy artillery and repulsed. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked the box and came too close for artillery fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun, a British counter-attack by infantry and tanks repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks from the north and south, by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.

The 7th Armoured Division commander was confident that the box was secure but the failure of the 50th Northumbrian Infantry Division to break through the Panzer-Lehr Division and reach the 7th Armoured Division, led to orders for the brigade group to retire to straighten the front line. The retirement, codenamed Operation Aniseed, began just after midnight. Decoy raids by <a href="Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> on <a href="Aunay-sur-Odon">Aunay-sur-Odon</a> and Evrecy, caused 29 casualties, destroyed a Tiger tank and damaged three more. Artillery harassing fire was maintained north and south of the withdrawal route but the Germans did little to intervene. Germans losses included and including several Tigers; British casualties were light and only three tanks were lost. Reynolds called the German casualty figures "exaggerated" and in his report, Hinde wrote "It is questionable whether the expenditure of artillery and small arms ammunition was justified by the scale of the enemy's efforts".

The failure of the operation led Dempsey to write that there was "no chance now of a snap operation with airborne troops either to seize Caen or to deepen the bridgehead on XXX Corps front. It is clear now that Caen can be taken only by set-piece assault and we do not have the men or ammunition for that at this time". After the war he wrote that the attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded and that his doubts about the suitability of <a href="Gerard%20Bucknall">Bucknall</a> and <a href="George%20Erskine">Erskine</a> increased. Dempsey called the handling of the battle a disgrace and said that the decision to withdraw from Villers-Bocage was made by the corps commander and Erskine. <a href="Carlo%20D%27Este">Carlo D'Este</a> called Dempsey's comments "excessively harsh" but historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity swiftly to capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall. <a href="John%20Buckley%20%28historian%29">John Buckley</a> wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation. The British official historian, <a href="Lionel%20Ellis">Lionel Ellis</a>, wrote that the result was "disappointing" but that the fighting power of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the "unexpected" arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division "could hardly have achieved full success". In 2001, Michael Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage. <a href="Hubert%20Meyer">Hubert Meyer</a> wrote that Operation Perch failed because the 50th Northumbrian Division and its armoured brigade could not overcome the Panzer-Lehr-Division, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attack in the east end of the bridgehead failed and because of the rapid counter-attack by advanced elements of the 2nd Panzer Division.

The allocation of insufficient infantry to the attack has been criticised, because there were two infantry battalions and most of the 1st Battalion the Rifle Brigade available to the 7th Armoured Division on 13 June and three fresh infantry brigades in the bridgehead. Reynolds wrote that Bucknall was at fault for failing to concentrate his forces. D'Este concurred but Bucknall defended his decision claiming the "49 [Division] ... [had] no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle, and not bundle them helter-skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around V[illers]-B[ocage] and Amaye". Buckley wrote that the operation was a failure of command. <a href="Terry%20Copp">Terry Copp</a> wrote that Dempsey continued to underestimate the German strength and commitment to defending the ground they held. <a href="Mungo%20Melvin">Mungo Melvin</a> wrote that Dempsey and the Second Army handled subordinate formations poorly, by not giving subordinates definite tasks, clear intentions and allowing discretion in the implementation of orders.

<a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Chester Wilmot</a> called Operation Perch a strategic success, "By the premature commitment of his armour, Rommel had delayed the British advance, but in the process he had played into Montgomery's hands for, once the panzer divisions were locked into battle with Second Army, they could not be used for their proper offensive task". Stephen Badsey wrote that Montgomery’s message to Bradley, "Caen is the key to Cherbourg" was true. The risk of a break-out past Caen immobilised the German armoured divisions at the east end of front, unable mount a counter-offensive against the First US Army. Hitler’s interference saved Rommel's military reputation because the unsuitability of the <a href="Cotentin">Cotentin</a> for armoured operations, the difficulties involved in movement and supply in the area and the strength of the Anglo-Canadian force, would have led to a more rapid and complete defeat of the German army in Normandy. By his order of 12 June, Hitler made the rest of the campaign a battle of attrition.

During Operation Perch, suffered 27 casualties, had nine tanks destroyed and a further 21 damaged; leaving the battalion with only 15 operation tanks by 16 June. For most of the formations involved in the fighting, specific casualty data are unavailable. By the end of June, the Panzer-Lehr Division had suffered 2,972 casualties and reported the loss of 51 tanks and assault guns, 82 half tracks and 294 other vehicles. By 16 June, the 12th SS-Panzer Division had reported 1,417 casualties and by 26 June the division had lost 41 tanks.

2008 ACC Championship Game

The 2008 <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> was a <a href="college%20football">college football</a> game between the <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> and the <a href="2008%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College Eagles</a>. The game, sponsored by <a href="Dr%20Pepper">Dr Pepper</a>, was the final regular-season contest of the <a href="2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2008 college football season</a> for the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a>. Virginia Tech defeated Boston College, winning the Atlantic Coast Conference football championship, 30–12.

The Virginia Tech Hokies were selected to represent the Coastal Division by virtue of a tie-breaking head-to-head victory against division rival <a href="2008%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a> and came into the game with an 8–4 record (5–3 in ACC play). Representing the Atlantic Division was Boston College, which had a 9–3 record (5–3 ACC). The two teams were the victors of a closely contested season in the ACC. Neither team clinched a spot in the game until the final week before the championship, and both had to rely on conference tie-breaking rules to earn a spot. The game was a rematch of <a href="2007%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">the previous year's contest</a>, which Virginia Tech won, 30–16.

The game was held at <a href="Raymond%20James%20Stadium">Raymond James Stadium</a> in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a> on December 6, 2008. Tampa had been chosen after poor attendance at the game's previous spot (<a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>) led conference officials to move the game. The 2008 championship was the first to be played in Tampa. The game began slowly, as both teams <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punted</a> after their opening possessions failed to gain a first down. Later in the quarter, Virginia Tech took a 7–0 lead with a five-yard <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> run by Tech <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>. The Hokies never relinquished the lead after that point. Tech extended its lead to 14–0 in the second quarter, but Boston College managed to narrow Tech's lead to 14–7 by <a href="halftime">halftime</a>. In the second half, Virginia Tech scored 17 points to the Eagles' five, and the Hokies won the game. In recognition of his game-winning performance, Taylor was named the game's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a>.

The <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> matches the winners of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Football">Coastal and Atlantic divisions</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a>. In the first decade of the 21st century, the league underwent an expansion to add three former <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East</a> members: <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami</a> and <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20Football">Virginia Tech</a> in 2004, and <a href="Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football">Boston College</a> in 2005. With the addition of a twelfth team, the ACC was allowed to hold a conference championship game under <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) rules.

The inaugural 2005 game featured a <a href="2005%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team">Florida State</a> win over <a href="2005%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech</a>, 27–22. In 2006, two different teams made their first appearances in the game, which was held in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. <a href="2006%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football%20team">Wake Forest</a> defeated <a href="2006%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a>, 9–6. In 2007, one team new to the championship game and championship-game veteran featured in the contest as <a href="2007%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech</a> faced off against <a href="2007%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College</a>. The game resulted in a 30–16 Virginia Tech victory.

Before the 2007 game, cities other than Jacksonville (site of the 2007 ACC Championship Game) presented their plans to be the site of the 2008 ACC Championship Game. After poor attendance in the ACC Championship Game at Jacksonville for the second straight year, ACC officials and representatives of the conference's member schools elected not to extend the Gator Bowl Association's contract to host the game for another year. On December 12, less than two weeks after Jacksonville had hosted the 2007 ACC Championship Game, the ACC announced that <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a> would host the game in 2008 and 2009 and <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> would host the game in 2010 and 2011.

The cities were chosen based on bids presented to the ACC and its member schools. Each city requested and was granted a two-year contract, locking the ACC into the locations well in advance. Tampa was chosen as the site of the 2008 game because Charlotte was scheduled to hold the annual <a href="Convention%20%28meeting%29">convention</a> of the <a href="Association%20for%20Career%20and%20Technical%20Education">Association for Career and Technical Education</a> at the same time as the game, and adequate hotel space would not be ready in time for the two events. Because of this, Charlotte's two-year span of hosting the game was pushed back to 2010.

Before the beginning of the <a href="2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2008 college football season</a>, the annual poll by media members who cover ACC football predicted <a href="2008%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a> to win the Atlantic Division and Virginia Tech to win the Coastal Division. Clemson received 59 of a possible 65 first-place votes in its division, while Virginia Tech received 58.

From the first game of the season, however, those preseason predictions were cast into doubt. Virginia Tech lost its season opener to lightly regarded <a href="East%20Carolina%20Pirates%20football">East Carolina</a>, while Clemson lost to <a href="2008%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team">Alabama</a>. Though neither loss factored into either team's conference standings, it reflected the early stages of a conference schedule that was regarded as crazy, wacky, "a mess", and "confusing" by members of the media and college football fans. So closely matched were the 12 teams of the conference that as late as the second-to-last week of the regular season, nine teams were still in the running for a place in the championship game. Heading into the final week of the regular season, four teams were still in position to potentially participate in the game: Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech from the Coastal Division, and Boston College and Florida State from the Atlantic Division. In that final week, Virginia Tech clinched the Coastal Division co-championship with a 17–14 win over Virginia, while Boston College became co-champions of the Atlantic Division with a 28–21 win against Maryland.

The Boston College Eagles entered the 2008 college football season having gone 11–3 during the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 season</a>, ending that season with a loss to Virginia Tech in the <a href="2007%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2007 ACC Championship Game</a> and a 24–21 victory over Michigan State in the <a href="2007%20Champs%20Sports%20Bowl">2007 Champs Sports Bowl</a>. In the annual preseason poll of media covering the ACC, Boston College was picked to finish fourth in the Atlantic Division.

The Eagles opened the season by traveling to <a href="Kent%20State%20Golden%20Flashes%20football">Kent State</a>, whom the Eagles defeated, 21–0. The Eagles' home opener was their second game of the season and was also their first conference game of the year. Against <a href="2008%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a>, the Eagles eked out a 9–7 halftime lead, but fell behind in the second half, eventually losing, 19–16, on a Georgia Tech touchdown that came with 8:26 remaining in the game. Despite the loss, the Eagles recovered quickly, beating <a href="2008%20UCF%20Knights%20football%20team">Central Florida</a>, 34–7, two weeks after the Georgia Tech game. The victory was the first in an eventual four-game win streak that culminated with a 28–23 defeat of then-No. 17 Virginia Tech.<ref name="BC/VT">The Associated Press. <a href="http%3A//sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap%3FgameId%3D282920103">"QB Crane struggles, but Boston College beats Va. Tech behind stingy defense."</a>, ESPN.com. October 18, 2008. Accessed December 1, 2008.</ref>

The win over Virginia Tech gave the Eagles a 2–1 conference record, and they appeared to be destined for a bid to the ACC Championship Game. But Boston College lost its next two games, both against conference opponents, dropping its record to 2–3. Despite the losses, Boston College still had a chance to win the Atlantic Division—but only if other teams lost as well. This happened on November 6, when fellow Atlantic Division team <a href="2008%20Maryland%20Terrapins%20football%20team">Maryland</a> lost to Virginia Tech, and the Eagles recovered from their losing streak with an out-of-conference win against <a href="2008%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team">Notre Dame</a>.

Notre Dame was the last out-of-conference opponent on Boston College's schedule, as the Eagles finished the season with three consecutive ACC games. The first of these was against <a href="2008%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team">Florida State</a> which led the Atlantic Division at the time, but had had five players suspended the day before the game. The Eagles secured a victory, 27–17. The second of Boston College's final opponents was Wake Forest, which had played in the 2006 ACC Championship Game. While Boston College won, 24–21, starting quarterback <a href="Chris%20Crane">Chris Crane</a> suffered a season-ending injury, leaving backup <a href="Dominique%20Davis">Dominique Davis</a> in charge of the Eagles' offense. Boston College's final game of the regular season was against Maryland and a victory against the Terrapins would push the Eagles to a tie with Florida State atop the Atlantic Division. Since Boston College had won the head-to-head game against Florida State, according to the ACC's tie-breaking rules, the Eagles would win the division. A 28–21 victory over Maryland brought Boston College to a 5–3 ACC record, giving it a co-division championship with Florida State and a trip to the ACC Championship Game.

The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 2008 season having won the 2007 ACC Championship Game, finishing with an 11–3 overall record that included a postseason loss to the <a href="2007%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football%20team">Kansas Jayhawks</a> in the <a href="2008%20Orange%20Bowl">2008 Orange Bowl</a>. Despite winning the ACC for the second time in less than four years, Virginia Tech was anticipated to spend 2008 rebuilding a team that saw 12 starters graduate or enter the <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a>. Though picked in a preseason poll to win the Coastal Division, the Hokies were defeated in their season opener by <a href="Underdog%20%28competition%29">underdog</a> East Carolina.

Following that loss, Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a> announced that backup quarterback <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>, who had previously been expected to sit out the season on <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> status, would play in the Hokies' second game, against <a href="Furman%20University%23Athletics">Furman</a>. Both Taylor and starting quarterback <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> performed well against the Paladins, and Tech won, 24–7. Tech's third game came against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, who were employing a new offensive system, the <a href="flexbone%20formation">option offense</a>, under first-year head coach <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Paul Johnson</a>. Unlike the game against Furman, Taylor started the game and remained at quarterback throughout, guiding the Hokies to their first ACC victory of the season, a 20–17 win that later gave Tech a crucial head-to-head tiebreaker against the Yellow Jackets, fellow members of the Coastal Division. The Hokies' fourth game of the season came against the <a href="2008%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football%20team">North Carolina Tar Heels</a>, who were defeated by the same margin of victory as Tech's win against Georgia Tech, 20–17.

The twin conference victories were followed by two out-of-conference wins: at <a href="Big%2012">Big 12</a> opponent <a href="2008%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team">Nebraska</a> and against independent <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20Hilltoppers">Western Kentucky</a>. At the end of the four-game winning streak, the Hokies had a 4–1 record, 2–0 in conference, and were ranked No. 17 in the country. On October 18, however, the Hokies lost to unranked Boston College in Boston, 28–23. The game was a rematch of the previous year's ACC Championship Game and was a preview of the 2008 Championship Game matchup. The loss was the start of a four-game skid for the Hokies that saw Tech lose three of four games, only managing a victory against Maryland, 23–13. The final game of that four-game drop was a 16–13 loss to Coastal Division rival <a href="2008%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a>, which then held a crucial tiebreaking win over the Hokies in the event of any head-to-head tie.

During the last two games of the regular season, the Hokies managed two victories: a 14–3 win against last-place ACC team Duke, and a 17–14 triumph over traditional rival Virginia. Miami, meanwhile, lost its final two games of the season: against Georgia Tech and North Carolina State. These losses dropped Miami to a 4–4 record in the ACC, one game behind the Hokies, who were tied with Georgia Tech at 5–3 following the end of the regular season. By virtue of the Hokies' head-to-head win against the Yellow Jackets, Virginia Tech earned a spot in the ACC Championship Game.

Following the last week of the regular season, both teams moved up in the national college football polls. Boston College, which had been ranked No. 21 in the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series%23Rankings">BCS Poll</a>, No. 20 in the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a>, and No. 22 in the <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">Coaches' Poll</a>, rose to No. 17 in the BCS, No. 18 in the AP Poll, and No. 20 in the Coaches' Poll. Virginia Tech, which had been unranked during the final week of the regular season, remained in the "Also Receiving Votes" category outside the top 25, except in the BCS Poll, where the Hokies rose to No. 25. <a href="Spread%20betting">Spread bettors</a> predicted an even game. Various betting organizations favored Boston College either by a single point or none. This close spread was due in small part to the teams' familiarity with each other. The championship game marked the fourth time in 14 months that the two teams played each other, and this fact was prominently mentioned in media coverage before the game's kickoff.

Almost immediately after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding to the problem of selling tickets was the <a href="Economic%20crisis%20of%202008">2008 economic crisis</a>, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.

The Boston College offense, which gained 319 yards per game on average, was ranked 94th (of 120 <a href="Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision">Football Bowl Subdivision</a> teams) in total offense. A key component of the offense was <a href="Guard%20%28American%20football%29">guard</a> Cliff Ramsey, who was named a first-team All-ACC selection, signifying his status as the best player at his position in the conference. Tight end <a href="Ryan%20Purvis">Ryan Purvis</a> was named a second-team All-ACC selection. Quarterback Dominique Davis led the Eagles' offense on the field heading into the ACC Championship. Davis had been the second-string quarterback until a season-ending injury to starter Chris Crane. During his limited time in the regular season, Davis had three passing and two rushing touchdowns.

Virginia Tech's offense was criticized for a lack of production during the regular season and was ranked 103rd in <a href="total%20offense">total offense</a>. The Hokies gained just 301 yards of offense on average during the regular season. Despite the meager statistical performance, Tech did have some standout players. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been expected to sit out the season in reserve, finished the year as the team's starter. Running back <a href="Darren%20Evans">Darren Evans</a> was named a second-team All-ACC selection, as was guard Sergio Render. Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receivers Danny Coale and <a href="Jarrett%20Boykin">Jarrett Boykin</a>. Coale entered the ACC Championship Game having caught 32 catches for 352 yards, while Boykin grabbed 27 passes for 407 yards.

The Eagles' defense was ranked eighth in the nation in terms of total defense, allowing an average of 277 yards per game. The Eagles led the country in <a href="interception">interception</a>s, recording 25 during the course of the regular season. The Eagles also were ranked among the top 10 in run defense, pass-efficiency defense, and No. 14 in scoring defense. That strong defensive effort was led by <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Mark%20Herzlich">Mark Herzlich</a>, who was selected as the ACC's defensive player of the year for the 2008 season. Herzlich led the Eagles in tackles with 98—fifth among all Division I players—and interceptions, with 6. He was forecast to be a key player during the ACC Championship Game. Defensive tackle <a href="B.%20J.%20Raji">B. J. Raji</a> recorded 33 tackles (11 for loss) and a team-high 7 sacks, part of a defense that allowed an average of just 87.3 rushing yards per game.

The Hokies' defense was ranked sixth in Division I-A during the regular season, permitting 275 yards per game on average. That defensive performance was led by cornerback <a href="Macho%20Harris">Victor "Macho" Harris</a>, who was named a first-team All-ACC selection on defense. Heading into the ACC Championship, Harris had 6 interceptions—2 returned for touchdowns—and 42 tackles. Harris also played on offense, catching 8 passes for 63 yards. Another defensive star for the Hokies was Orion Martin, a former <a href="Walk-on%20%28sport%20term%29">walk-on</a> who was third in the ACC in sacks with 7.5 and earned second-team ACC honors.

The 2008 ACC Championship Game <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> on December 6, 2008, at 1 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> at <a href="Raymond%20James%20Stadium">Raymond James Stadium</a> in Tampa, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. At kickoff, the weather was partly cloudy with 59 percent humidity and a temperature of . The wind was from the south-southwest at . The official reported attendance was 53,927, but this number came from the number of tickets sold. The actual attendance in the stadium—measured by admittance turnstiles—was 27,360, the lowest ever recorded for an ACC football championship game. Ticket demand was so low that tickets were being given away for free outside the stadium before kickoff. The game was televised in the United States by the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a>, and <a href="Brad%20Nessler">Brad Nessler</a>, <a href="Bob%20Griese">Bob Griese</a>, <a href="Paul%20Maguire">Paul Maguire</a>, and <a href="Todd%20Harris">Todd Harris</a> were the announcers. Approximately 3.3 million people watched the game, earning the broadcast a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 2.9. The rating was the lowest ever recorded for an ACC Championship football game and represented a 41% decline from the previous year's rating of 4.2.

Boston College won the ceremonial pre-game <a href="coin%20flipping">coin toss</a> to determine first possession and elected to kick off to begin the game, ensuring that the Eagles would receive the ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech <a href="Kickoff%20return">kick returner</a> Dyrell Roberts fielded the ball at the Tech six-yard line and returned it to the Tech 33-yard line before the first play of the game, a four-yard <a href="forward%20pass">pass</a> from <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> Tyrod Taylor to <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> Danny Coale. Despite that initial gain, the Hokies were unable to advance the ball further and punted after going <a href="three-and-out">three and out</a>. Boston College's Rich Gunnell <a href="fair%20catch">fair caught</a> the kick at the Eagles' 16-yard line, where the Boston College offense ran its first play of the game. <a href="Running%20back">Running back</a> Montel Harris ran for a one-yard gain, but Boston College was unable to gain the needed ten yards for a first down, just as Virginia Tech had failed to do in the prior series. After going three and out, the Eagles punted back to Virginia Tech and the Hokies' offense returned to the field at the Tech 39-yard line with 11:30 remaining in the first quarter.

The first play of the drive was an incomplete pass by Taylor, but the Hokies earned the initial first down of the game two plays later when Taylor completed a 14-yard throw to Roberts, advancing the ball to the 41-yard line of Boston College in the process. After a five-yard penalty against the Hokies, Taylor completed two consecutive passes: one to Evans for a 12-yard gain and the other to Roberts for a 10-yard gain. Now at the 24-yard line of Boston College, Virginia Tech's offense began running the ball instead of passing it. Evans <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushed</a> for five yards, then second-string running back Josh Oglesby ran for seven more on the next two plays. The first of Oglesby's rushes resulted in a first down inside the Eagles' <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23R">red zone</a>, and Tech continued to advance the ball on the ground as Evans ran another five yards. Facing third down at the Boston College five-yard line, Virginia Tech called a timeout to formulate its next offensive play. That play was a five-yard rush by Taylor, who crossed the <a href="Goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a> for the game's first score, a Virginia Tech <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. The subsequent <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> kick was successful, and the Hokies took a 7–0 lead with 6:27 remaining in the first quarter.

Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was fielded at the Boston College 13-yard line by the Eagles' Harris, who returned it to the Boston College 28-yard line, and the Eagles' offense began its second drive of the game. Eagles quarterback Dominique Davis completed his first pass of the game, a 19-yard catch by Brandon Robinson, who advanced the ball to the Boston College 47-yard line for a first down. Davis then <a href="Quarterback%20scramble">scrambled</a> for a four-yard gain, and Harris ran for nine yards on the next two plays, gaining the Eagles' second first down of the game. Once inside the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, however, the Hokies' defense stiffened. Davis was able to gain six yards on two running plays, but after an incomplete pass, the Eagles were forced to punt for the second time in the first quarter. The kick sailed into the end zone for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>, and Virginia Tech's offense began work at its 20-yard line. The Hokies' third drive of the quarter mirrored its first, however, as Virginia Tech went three and out and punted after failing to gain a first down. The Eagles recovered the ball with 1:32 remaining in the quarter and committed a five-yard false start penalty to begin their possession. On the first play after the penalty, Davis was <a href="Quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> for a loss of two yards. Harris regained the lost yardage and more with a six-yard run, but after Davis threw an incomplete pass on third down, the Eagles were forced to punt again. Before they could kick the ball, however, the quarter came to an end. With three quarters remaining in the game, Virginia Tech held a 7–0 lead.

The second quarter began with Boston College in possession of the ball at its 28-yard line and preparing to punt. Virginia Tech's Harris fielded the kick at the Tech 35-yard line and returned it to the Tech 49-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took to the field for their first play of the second quarter. Evans gained six yards on a rush, then Coale was stopped for no gain on an <a href="end-around">end-around</a>. Facing third down and needing four yards, Taylor passed for a first down to Boykin, who advanced the ball to the Boston College 39-yard line. On the next play, Evans broke free for a 30-yard gain, giving the Hokies a first down at the Eagles' nine-yard line. Three plays later, Taylor ran four yards for the Hokies' second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 14–0 with 11:08 remaining in the first half.

Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was returned to the Boston College 20-yard line, and the Eagles began their first full possession of the second quarter. Davis lost a yard on a running play, then was sacked for an eight-yard loss. Facing third down and needing 19 yards for a first down, Harris gained five yards and the Eagles punted after going <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a>. The kick was returned to the Eagles' 36-yard line, and Tech began a possession deep in Boston College territory. The first Tech play lost two yards, but the Hokies regained the lost yardage on the next play, picking up four yards with a pass from Taylor to Evans. Taylor scrambled on third down, gaining eight yards and a first down. The Hokies attempted a short run, then Taylor gained another first down with a pass to the BC 14-yard line. Once there, however, Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty, pushing the Hokies backwards. After the penalty, Taylor was tackled for a loss of seven more yards. Facing a second down and 27 yards, Taylor attempted to pass for the first down, but the ball was batted into the air and intercepted by a Boston College defender.

Following the turnover, the Eagles' offense began work at their 46-yard line. Davis completed a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis was able to gain the first down with a pass to Rich Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled and the ball was recovered in the end zone by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on offense at its 20-yard line. Following the turnover, Tech went three and out, punting back to Boston College with 2:11 remaining before halftime.

The kick was fair caught at the 34-yard line of Boston College. On the first play after the kick, Davis connected with Harris on a pass play that resulted in a 51-yard gain for the Eagles. At the Tech 15-yard line following the big gain, the Eagles lost one yard on a rushing play before Davis passed to Gunnell for a 16-yard gain and a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:29 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech's lead was cut to 14–7.

The Eagles' post-touchdown kickoff was returned to the Tech 33-yard line, and on the first play after the kick, Boston College committed a personal foul penalty when Tyrod Taylor was hit out of bounds. Following the penalty, the ball was advanced to the Tech 42-yard line and the Hokies were given a first down. Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed out of bounds, and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than try to score quickly, Boston College elected to <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">run out the clock</a> with Virginia Tech leading, 14–7.

Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game, Boston College received the ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession of the second half. An incomplete pass by Davis was followed by a short rush and another incomplete pass, and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went out of bounds at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession of the second half. Tech likewise went three and out, then returned the ball to the Eagles with a punt. The kick went out of bounds, and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.

The first Eagles' play after the Tech punt was a 22-yard pass from Davis to Gunnell for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Following the long gain, the Eagles were unable to gain another first down, and punted back to the Hokies. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 16-yard line with 11:08 remaining in the third quarter, and the Virginia Tech offense returned to the field. Tech advanced the ball on three consecutive plays: a six-yard pass to Evans, a short rush by Evans, then a first down pass to Roberts. Following the first down, Evans ran for another first down, advancing the Hokies to their 44-yard line. Two Tech plays were stopped for little or no gain, but on third and nine, Taylor scrambled for an 18-yard gain and a first down at the Boston College 37-yard line. Evans gained six yards on first down, but the Hokies were unable to gain the next four yards. Instead of punting, Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Jared Keys into the game to attempt a field goal. Keys' 50-yard kick sailed through the uprights, and Tech extended its lead to 17–7 with 6:07 remaining in the quarter.

Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 30-yard line. Davis started the drive with an incomplete pass, then Harris gained seven yards with a rush up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and Boston College punted. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 30-yard line, and with 5:01 left in the quarter, the Hokies returned to offense. On the first play, Taylor ran 11 yards for a first down. Taylor threw an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were penalized 10 yards for holding, pushing them back to the 31-yard line. Tech was unable to regain the lost yardage, and punted. The kick was 57 yards, and Boston College was further backed up by a penalty during the return. Following the kick, Boston College's offense was forced back to its seven-yard line to start. An incomplete pass was followed by a scramble by Davis. During the run, Davis fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Boston College player. Facing third down, Davis scrambled again, this time for a first down to the 21-yard line. On the first play after the first down scramble, a deep pass downfield by Davis was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Stephan Virgil. The interception was returned to the Boston College 10-yard line, and on the first play by Tech's offense, Evans ran the ten yards for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:17 remaining, the Hokies extended their lead to 24–7.

Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and the Eagles began on offense at their 20-yard line. Three consecutive incomplete passes later, Boston College punted, ending their sixth three and out of the game. Following the kick, Tech started at its 27-yard line. On first down, the Hokies ran an end-around for five yards, then the quarter came to an end. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led, 24–7.

Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball and facing a second down and five from their 33-yard line. The first play of the quarter was a seven-yard run by Evans, who earned a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. On the next play after the first down run, Evans fumbled the ball and Boston College recovered. The Eagles' offense started within field goal range at the Tech 30-yard line. Boston College's first play was stopped for no gain, but the second was a 22-yard pass by Davis to Gunnell, giving the Eagles a first down inside the Tech 10-yard line. Davis threw three incomplete passes before Boston College coach Jeff Jagodzinski sent kicker <a href="Steve%20Aponavicius">Steve Aponavicius</a> into the game to attempt a 24-yard field goal. The kick was good, and the Eagles cut Tech's lead to 24–10.

The post-touchdown kickoff was returned to the Tech 20-yard line, and the Hokies began an offensive drive hoping to run down the clock and preserve their two-touchdown lead. Because the game clock continues to run on rushing plays, the Hokies executed five consecutive rushing plays, picking up a first down in the process. The Hokies were unable to gain a second first down, however, and Tech punted from its 40-yard line. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Eagles' 28-yard line with 9:28 remaining in the game, and Boston College took over on offense. On the first play after the punt, however, Tech defender <a href="Jason%20Worilds">Jason Worilds</a> tackled Davis, forcing a fumble, which bounced into the hands of fellow defender Orion Martin, who ran it 17 yards for a defensive touchdown. The extra point bounced off an upright, however, and was no good. Still, with just 9:05 remaining in the game, Tech took a commanding 30–10 lead.

The Hokies' kickoff after the defensive score was caught at the goal line and returned to the 28-yard line by Boston College's Chris Fox. Following the return, Davis completed a seven-yard pass to the 35-yard line, then picked up a first down to the 42-yard line with another pass. Davis then scrambled three yards and threw for another first down, this time to tight end Lars Anderson. Now at the Tech 46-yard line, Davis threw three incomplete passes before throwing another on fourth down. With 6:39 remaining in the game, Boston College turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense. The Hokies again began to run out the clock. Evans ran the ball three consecutive times, but on the third rush, Evans fumbled for the second time in the game. The fumble was recovered by Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich and Boston College's offense returned to the field.

From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis threw an incomplete pass then connected on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis for a first down. After an incomplete pass, Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped into the air and caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced the ball to the 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time for a late scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered an intentional <a href="safety%20%28gridiron%20football%20score%29">safety</a> rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick has the potential to be blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, an intentional safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.

The free kick following the intentional safety was returned to near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling on the ball after taking the field on offense.

In recognition of his winning performance during the ACC Championship, Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor was named the game's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a>. Taylor finished the game having completed 11 of his 19 pass attempts for 84 yards and one interception. He also ran the ball 11 times for 30 yards and two touchdowns. On the opposite side of the ball, Boston College quarterback Dominique Davis was the game's leading passer, having completed 17 of his 43 pass attempts for 263 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. Davis also carried the ball 14 times for 12 yards on the ground. Davis' 51-yard pass to Harris in the second quarter set an ACC Championship Game record for the longest play recorded to that point.

Boston College wide receiver Rich Gunnell was the game's leading receiver, having been the primary beneficiary of Davis' prolific passing. Gunnell finished the game having caught seven passes for 114 yards and one touchdown. Virginia Tech wide receiver Dyrell Roberts was the game's second-leading receiver. He caught four passes for 44 yards. Tech's second-most proficient receiver was running back Darren Evans, who caught three passes for 22 yards. Evans was the game's leading rusher, having carried the ball 31 times for 114 yards and a touchdown. On the opposite side, Boston College running back Montel Harris led the Eagles on the ground with nine carries for 34 yards.

Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led all players with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, one and a half were for negative yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was <a href="Cody%20Grimm">Cody Grimm</a>, who had eight tackles, two and a half of which were for losses. One and a half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.

Virginia Tech's win in the ACC Championship Game brought it to a 9–4 record, while Boston College's loss brought it also to a 9–4 record. Both teams' standings in the national polls were affected by the game. In the BCS poll, the Eagles fell from 17th to 24th, while Virginia Tech rose from 25th to 19th. In the AP Poll, Tech rose to 21st, while Boston College fell out of the poll entirely, appearing in the "also receiving votes" category at 27th. With the win, Virginia Tech was awarded the ACC's automatic Bowl Championship Series bid to the <a href="2009%20Orange%20Bowl">2009 Orange Bowl</a>. Boston College, meanwhile, was selected to play in the <a href="2008%20Music%20City%20Bowl">2008 Music City Bowl</a>. The pick by the Music City Bowl represented a drop in prestige for Boston College. Had the Eagles won the championship game, they would have earned an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl and a payout of $17.5 million. Instead, the Music City Bowl, which offered a payout of $1.7 million, was contractually obliged to select the Eagles after Boston College was not selected by any of the three more prestigious bowl games with ACC ties.

The Music City Bowl took place on December 31, and in a contest against <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> opponent <a href="2008%20Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20football%20team">Vanderbilt</a>, Boston College lost, 16–13. The loss ended a streak of eight consecutive bowl game wins for Boston College. In the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech emerged victorious against Big East Conference champion <a href="2008%20Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football%20team">Cincinnati</a>, 20–7. The win was Tech's first BCS bowl game win since 1995, and was the first ACC BCS game win since 2000.

Following the loss to Vanderbilt in the 2008 Music City Bowl, Boston College head coach Jeff Jagodzinski announced his intention to interview for the vacant head coaching position with the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. In an unusual move, Boston College athletic director Gene DeFillippo announced that if Jagodzinski went ahead with an interview, he would be fired as head coach of the Boston College football team. DeFillippo previously stated that a five-year contract with Jagodzinski, signed in 2007, was contingent on the coach staying "for the long term". Jagodzinski proceeded with the interview and was fired by DeFillippo on January 7.

To replace Jagodzinski, DeFillippo promoted Boston College defensive coordinator <a href="Frank%20Spaziani">Frank Spaziani</a>, who previously served as the Boston College head coach on an interim basis in 2006. Boston College offensive coordinator <a href="Steve%20Logan%20%28American%20football%29">Steve Logan</a>, who was unhappy with the staff changes on the football team, resigned shortly after Spaziani's promotion. To replace Logan, Spaziani hired former <a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">Navy</a> head coach <a href="Gary%20Tranquill">Gary Tranquill</a> as Boston College's new offensive coordinator. One week after Logan's announcement, the Eagles' offensive line coach, <a href="Jack%20Bicknell%2C%20Jr.">Jack Bicknell, Jr.</a>, also announced that he was leaving the team. On January 27, special teams and tight ends coach <a href="Don%20Yanowsky">Don Yanowsky</a> announced his resignation from the Eagles, making him the fourth coach to be fired or resign from the Boston College football team after the season.

Fuji-class battleship

The was a two-ship <a href="ship%20class">class</a> of <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) in the mid-1890s. They were the first battleships in the IJN, and were constructed in the UK as Japan lacked the industrial facilities needed to build them. Their design was based on the battleships being built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> at that time.

The ships participated in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–1905, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> in February 1904 and two bombardments of <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> during the following month. <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Yashima">"Yashima"</a> struck a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> off Port Arthur in May and <a href="capsized">capsized</a> while under tow several hours later. <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Fuji">"Fuji"</a> fought in the Battles of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima</a> and was lightly damaged in the latter action. She was reclassified as a <a href="coast%20defence%20ship">coast defence ship</a> in 1910 and served as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for the rest of her active career. The ship was <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a>ed in 1922 and converted into a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> fitted with classrooms. "Fuji" was finally <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap in 1948.

In the late 19th century, the strategy of the Imperial Japanese Navy was based on the radical <a href="Jeune%20Ecole">Jeune Ecole</a> naval philosophy, as promoted by French <a href="military%20advisor">military advisor</a> and <a href="naval%20architect">naval architect</a> <a href="Emile%20Bertin">Emile Bertin</a>. This emphasised cheap <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Imperial Chinese</a> <a href="Beiyang%20Fleet">Beiyang Fleet</a> in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.

Obtaining funding for the battleships was a struggle for the Japanese government. The initial request was submitted in the budget of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Matsukata%20Masayoshi">Matsukata Masayoshi</a> in 1891, but was deleted by the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet of Japan</a> due to political infighting. Matsukata submitted the request again and, when again denied, was forced to dissolve his <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a>. His successor, Prime Minister <a href="It%C5%8D%20Hirobumi">Itō Hirobumi</a>, attempted to pass the funding measure in 1892, but he also failed. This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund the construction of the two battleships himself, through an annual reduction in the expenses of the <a href="Imperial%20Household%20Agency">Imperial Household</a>, and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding measure for the "Fuji"-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> shortly before they were <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.

The design of the "Fuji" class was derived from that of the British s, albeit about smaller. The "Fuji"-class ships improved on the "Royal Sovereign"s in several ways; they were about faster, they incorporated superior <a href="Harvey%20armour">Harvey armour</a>, and their guns, although smaller and lighter, were the same as those of the later and were protected by armoured hoods (<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s). The two ships of the class were almost identical even though they were designed by two different naval architects, "Yashima" by <a href="Philip%20Watts%20%28naval%20architect%29">Philip Watts</a> and "Fuji" by <a href="George%20C.%20Mackrow">George C. Mackrow</a>. The primary difference was that "Yashima" had her <a href="deadwood%20%28shipbuilding%29">deadwood</a> cut away aft and was fitted with a <a href="balanced%20rudder">balanced rudder</a>. This made her almost a knot faster than her <a href="sister%20ship">sister</a> and gave her a smaller turning circle at the cost of a weaker <a href="stern">stern</a> that required careful attention when <a href="drydock">drydock</a>ed lest it sag.

The "Fuji"-class ships had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . They displaced at normal load. The ships had <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>s and were subdivided into a total of 181 <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s. The crew numbered about 650 officers and enlisted men. "Yashima" was fitted as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a> with accommodation for an admiral and his staff.

The "Fuji"-class ships were powered by two <a href="Humphrys%2C%20Tennant%20and%20Dykes">Humphrys Tennant</a> 3-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by ten cylindrical <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a>s with a working pressure of . The engines were rated at , using <a href="forced%20draught">forced draught</a>, and designed to reach a top speed of although the ships proved to be faster during their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, reaching top speeds of . A watertight centreline <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> separated the two engine rooms as well as the four <a href="Fire%20room">boiler rooms</a>. The boiler rooms were further separated by a transverse bulkhead. Unlike both the "Royal Sovereign"s and "Majestic"s, the "Fuji" class had their <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>s on the centreline.

The ships carried a maximum of of coal which allowed them to steam for at a speed of . They were fitted with three electric <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s, each rated at .

The <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of the "Fuji" class consisted of four hydraulically operated <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Elswick Ordnance Company</a> 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth%2012%20inch%20naval%20gun">Type 41 twelve-inch guns</a> mounted in pear-shaped twin-gun <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s fore and aft of the superstructure. The barbettes had a firing arc of 240° and the guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and could depress to −5°. These barbettes had armoured hoods, or turrets, to protect the guns. The mountings were virtually identical to those used in the first "Majestic"-class battleships, which could only hoist ammunition from the below-decks <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s in one position. However, 18 shells were stowed in each turret that allowed a limited amount of firing at any angle before their ammunition supply needed to be replenished. The guns were loaded at a fixed angle of 1° and fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . This gave them an approximate range of .

<a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">Secondary armament</a> of the "Fuji" class consisted of ten 40-calibre <a href="Type%2041%206-inch%20%28152%20mm%29/40-caliber%20naval%20gun">Type 41 six-inch</a> <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing guns</a>, four on the main deck in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and six guns on the upper deck protected by <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Protection from torpedo boat attacks was provided by fourteen <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss">three-pounder Hotchkiss guns</a> and ten 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s. The three-pounder gun fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of while the 2.5-pounder fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . The ships were also equipped with five <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one in the bow above water and four submerged tubes, two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.

In 1901, both ships exchanged 16 of their 47 mm guns for an equal number of <a href="QF%2012-pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun">QF 12-pounder 12 cwt</a> guns. They fired , projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . This raised the number of crewmen to 652 and later to 741.

The armour scheme of the "Fuji"-class ships was similar to that used by the "Royal Sovereign"s except that the Japanese ships used superior Harvey armour of the same thickness instead of <a href="compound%20armour">compound armour</a>. The <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armor%20belt">main belt</a> was high, of which was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of . It reduced to then at the ends past the two barbettes; above it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour that ran between the barbettes. They were 14 inches thick outside the upper armour belt and reduced to behind the upper belt. Diagonal bulkheads connected the barbettes to the side armour; the forward bulkhead was 14 inches thick while the rear bulkhead was thick. The armour of the casemates and the barbette hoods had a maximum thickness of 6 inches while the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected by 14 inches of armour. The <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour was thick and met the sides of the ship at the top of the main armour belt.

Both ships had reached Japan by February 1898.
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, "Fuji" and "Yashima" were assigned to the 1st Division of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a>. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February, when Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the <a href="Pacific%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">Pacific Squadron</a> anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as his and six-inch guns inflicted very little damage on the Russian vessels, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships. "Yashima" was not struck during the battle, but "Fuji" was hit twice, two men being killed and 10 wounded.
On 10 March, the two ships blindly bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay, on the southwest side of the <a href="Liaodong%20Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>, at a range of , but did little damage. When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coastal defence guns that had been transferred there, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay. The Japanese ships disengaged after "Fuji" was hit by a 12-inch shell.

"Fuji" and "Yashima" participated in the action of 13 April when Tōgō successfully lured out two battleships of the Pacific Squadron. When the Russians spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, they turned back for Port Arthur and the battleship struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded. Emboldened by his success, Tōgō resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields.

On 14 May 1904, the battleships <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Hatsuse">"Hatsuse"</a>, , and "Yashima", the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> <a href="Japanese%20cruiser%20Kasagi">"Kasagi"</a>, and the <a href="dispatch%20boat">dispatch boat</a> put to sea to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur. The following morning, the squadron encountered a Russian minefield. "Hatsuse" struck one mine that disabled her steering and "Yashima" struck two others when moving to assist "Hatsuse". "Yashima" was towed away from the minefield, but she was still taking on water at an uncontrollable rate and the crew abandoned ship some five hours later. "Kasagi" took "Yashima" in tow, but the battleship's <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> continued to increase and she capsized about three hours later.
During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, "Fuji" was not damaged because the Russian ships concentrated their fire on Tōgō's flagship, the battleship , which was leading the column. In May the following year, during the Battle of Tsushima, "Fuji" was hit a dozen times, the most serious of which penetrated the hood of the rear barbette, ignited some exposed propellant charges, killed eight men and wounded nine. After the ammunition fire was put out, the left gun in the barbette resumed firing and apparently delivered the "<a href="coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">coup de grâce</a>" that sank the battleship .

On 23 October 1908, "Fuji" hosted a dinner for the American Ambassador, <a href="Thomas%20J.%20O%27Brien%20%28Michigan%20politician%29">Thomas J. O'Brien</a>, and the senior officers of the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a> during its circumnavigation of the world. In 1910, her cylindrical boilers were replaced by Miyabara <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s and her main armament was replaced by Japanese-built guns. "Fuji" was reclassified as a first-class coast defence ship the same year, and undertook training duties in various capacities until disarmed in 1922. Her hulk continued to be used as a floating <a href="barracks">barracks</a> and training centre at Yokosuka until 1945. "Fuji" was damaged by American carrier aircraft during their 18 July 1945 <a href="attack%20on%20Yokosuka">attack on Yokosuka</a> and capsized after the end of the war. The ship was scrapped in 1948.

Terms of Endearment (The X-Files)

"Terms of Endearment" is the seventh episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", and originally aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on January 3, 1999. Written by David Amann and directed by <a href="Rob%20Bowman%20%28director%29">Rob Bowman</a>, "Terms of Endearment" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. It earned a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 10.5 and was watched by 18.7 million people on its initial broadcast. The performance given by guest actor <a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a> attracted positive comments, but the plot was criticized.

The show centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) who work on cases linked to the paranormal called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the installment, an unborn child is apparently abducted from its mother's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects. After Agent Spender dismisses the assignment as irrelevant to the X-Files, Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature. While looking into the report, the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider (Campbell) is a child-abducting demon.

"Terms of Endearment", an inversion of the 1968 film "<a href="Rosemary%27s%20Baby%20%28film%29">Rosemary's Baby</a>", was the first episode written by "The X-Files" executive story editor David Amann, a staff member who later became a regular contributor to the series. Campbell, already well known as a <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a> actor in several <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a> horror movies, was cast as Wayne Weinsider. Many of the episode's special effects were created without elaborate computer-generated effects. Critics have complimented the episode's unique representation of its antagonist, who has been classified as a sympathetic villain.

In <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke, Virginia</a>, Wayne Weinsider (<a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a>) and his pregnant wife Laura (<a href="Lisa%20Jane%20Persky">Lisa Jane Persky</a>) learn via an <a href="medical%20ultrasonography">ultrasound scan</a> that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a <a href="demon">demon</a>-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly <a href="miscarriage">miscarried</a>.

Laura's brother, local <a href="deputy%20sheriff">deputy sheriff</a> Arky Stevens, reports her story to the <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s section at the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>. Agent <a href="Jeffrey%20Spender">Jeffrey Spender</a> (<a href="Chris%20Owens%20%28actor%29">Chris Owens</a>) discards the report, but Agent <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) salvages the case and travels to Virginia with Agent <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>). As Mulder and Scully interview the Weinsiders, the police, who suspect an illegal <a href="abortion">abortion</a>, find the remains of the baby in the garden furnace. Wayne quickly confesses to destroying the evidence, claiming that his wife had aborted the child while in a trance-like state. He <a href="gaslighting">convinces Laura that his story is true</a>, persuading her to turn herself in. While visiting Laura in jail, Wayne attempts to steal her soul, but the <a href="Emergency%20medical%20technician">EMT</a> is able to save her life, much to his surprise. Meanwhile, Wayne has another wife, Betsy Monroe, who is also pregnant.

Mulder, determining that Wayne is a <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech</a> immigrant by the name of Ivan <a href="Veles%20%28god%29">Veles</a>, reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a <a href="demon">demon</a> who is trying to have a normal baby, and suspects that he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon-like traits. Betsy has a dream similar to Laura's, but recognizes the dream-demon as her husband. Nevertheless, she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully. The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider. He is taken to hospital and placed in a bed next to Laura. A mist passes from Weinsider's body into Laura's, at which point Weinsider dies and Laura recovers.

Mulder and Scully discover remains of normal human babies in Betsy's yard. Upon seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who is unable to have demonic offspring unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to have. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame Weinsider. At the end of the narrative, Betsy drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.

"Terms of Endearment" was written by "The X-Files" executive story editor David Amann, making it his first writing contribution to the series. The concept for "Terms of Endearment" was "about the fifth or sixth idea" Amann came up with for the show. Amann's original idea was to write what he described as ""Rosemary's Baby" in reverse". He explained, "I had this idea [for doing the episode] not from the point of view of the hapless woman unwittingly impregnated, but from the point of view of the devil". Amann pitched his idea to series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a>, who gave him the commission to write the rest of the episode.

According to Amann, the initial draft was "heavier on pure shock value and lighter on humor and human interest". In this version, Laura Weinsider birthed a snake rather than a demon baby. In addition, the story unraveled in a more "linear" fashion. This draft also called for the devil to seek a human baby, resulting in the sacrifice of his wife. The series' regular writers felt that this initial version of the story had a certain "inevitability" to it. Carter suggested that the second woman should be a demon. Amann later admitted that this addition made the story "work well". Kerry Fall from "DVD Journal" suggested that the plot revolved around "the wives and lives of a demon trying to have a normal child."

The score for "Terms of Endearment" was composed by series regular <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a>, who used <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>s to give the atmosphere a "creepy" feel. The 1995 song "<a href="Only%20Happy%20When%20It%20Rains">Only Happy When It Rains</a>" by <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> group <a href="Garbage%20%28band%29">Garbage</a> plays several times in the episode, most notably when Betsy Monroe drives away with her demon baby. The quote "Zazas, zazas, nasatanada zazas"—what Laura Weinsider was supposed to have said while "in a trance"—is what the <a href="occult">occult</a>ist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> used to open the 10th Aethyr of the <a href="Thelema">Thelemic</a> demon <a href="Choronzon">Choronzon</a>. "Terms of Endearment" is not the first occasion that the series drew influence from Crowley; a high school from the episode "<a href="Die%20Hand%20Die%20Verletzt">Die Hand Die Verletzt</a>" was named after him as well.

Rick Millikan selected Lisa Jane Persky, who was at the top of his casting "wish list", for the role of Laura. In the middle of filming, a cast member withdrew from the production for religious reasons. A mother withdrew her baby from the cast during the final run-through of the "cursed-birth" scene. Although a fan of the show, as a devout Catholic she was uncomfortable with her child representing a demon. Director Rob Bowman was sympathetic to her concerns, and the casting staff was able to find a replacement baby in less than 45 minutes. It was the first time during the filming of the series that a cast-member withdrew for religious reasons.

<a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a>, known for taking leading roles in Sam Raimi horror movies such as "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead%20%28franchise%29">The Evil Dead</a>" trilogy, was cast as the episode's antagonist Wayne Weinsider. Campbell had previously worked for the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on his short lived series "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Brisco%20County%2C%20Jr.">The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.</a>", which began as the lead-in show for "The X-Files" during the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29">first season</a>. Fox had initially assumed that "Brisco County, Jr." was going to be the more successful series, while "The X-Files" was more unappreciatively referred to as "the other drama Fox ordered that spring". Several of the individuals who worked on the failed "Brisco County, Jr." series later found a career working on "The X-Files", which led Campbell to call the process a "coming home" experience.

Campbell first met both Duchovny and Anderson during the promotional campaigns for both series in 1993. He commented that, although Duchovny was known for playing a serious role on the show, in real life he was quite a funny person. During shooting, Campbell and Duchovny entertained themselves on set by pranking the crew members, eventually stopping it when crew members became upset. Although Campbell had a positive opinion of working on the show, he commented that the nature of the show did not allow for much improvisation, describing the production as a "well oiled machine".

The first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and production of the show's sixth season was based in Los Angeles, California. The principal outdoor filming for "Terms of Endearment" took place around <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a>, called "the most East Coast-like part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area" by Andy Meisler in his book "The End and the Beginning". The car featured in the episode was a <a href="Chevrolet%20Camaro%20%28second%20generation%29">Chevrolet Camaro Z28</a> convertible. Meisler sardonically wrote that <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> had "no qualms about seeing their vehicles driven onscreen by a relative of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>".

Several of the special effects used in the episode were created in a "low-stress" manner that did not rely wholly on <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">Computer-generated imagery</a>. During the childbirth scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a fire-proof bed. The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give the effect that the fire was mere inches away from the bed. Producer <a href="John%20Shiban">John Shiban</a> said that the film crew made "a big deal out of the eyes" to make the scene frightening. The devil <a href="Medical%20ultrasonography">sonogram</a> was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.

The burnt baby skeleton was built from scratch. Originally, the crew had planned on renting a real fetal skeleton, but the $3,000 cost forced them to make their own. Office manager Donovan Brown noted that, "we got two or three of those adults skeleton models, cut a foot or so off a leg here and shortened an arm there, glued them together to a plaster model of a fetal skull we found, and put together something that worked wonderfully".

A main theme in the episode is the horror of child birth. Amann describes the episode as an inversion of the 1968 horror film "Rosemary's Baby" which is about a woman scared of giving birth to a demonic baby. As with many other episodes of the series, "Terms of Endearment" is heavily influenced by horror films, and features gothic imagery. In addition to "Rosemary's Baby" and other <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a> films, the episode shows stylistic references to the 1972 film "<a href="The%20Exorcist%20%28film%29">The Exorcist</a>" and the 1981 film "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead">The Evil Dead</a>". The influence of the genre extends to the casting of Campbell, an actor unfamiliar to the mainstream public but with a prominent cult following among horror fans.

The main antagonist of "Terms of Endearment", Weinsider, is a child-murdering demon. However, the episode plays against genre archetypes by turning Weinsider into a sympathetic villain. Critics have pointed out that the character's presentation was not entirely negative. Some have commented that Campbell humanized the character, portraying him in a manner that adds likability to a character who could have been more sinister. By the time Weinsider is defeated, the audience is led to partially identify with him. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save the life of his wife, showcasing heroic qualities and subverting the way that villains are often portrayed in the genre.

"Terms of Endearment" originally aired on the Fox network on January 3, 1999, with a tagline of "Born to raise hell. Tonight, something terrifying is about to be born". It earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 10.5, with a 15 share, meaning that roughly 10.5 percent of all television-equipped households, and 15 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode, which was viewed by 18.70 million viewers. It later aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on <a href="Sky1">Sky1</a> on April 18, 1999, and received 0.62 million viewers, making it the eighth most watched television show that week.

Upon its first broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, in a review of the sixth season in "<a href="The%20Charlotte%20Observer">The Charlotte Observer</a>", called the episode "just plain bad." <a href="Sarah%20Stegall">Sarah Stegall</a> awarded the episode two stars out of five, positively comparing it to the work of Roman Polanski, but criticizing its failure to deliver truly scary material. Stegall mused that "Terms of Endearment" lacked the edgy writing of some of the best episodes of the series, though she did note that Campbell "turns in a good performance with mediocre material". She also criticized the depiction of religious material, comparing it negatively to other episodes with religious themes including "<a href="Revelations%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Revelations</a>" and "<a href="Miracle%20Man%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Miracle Man</a>".

Paula Vitaris from "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, calling it a disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it undermines established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book "Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files", praises the installment, saying, "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you to see what you can cook up. ... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.

In the years following "Terms of Endearment"'s original broadcast, critical reception improved. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave three stars out of five, describing it as "a very brave story". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode suffered from its attempt to balance comedy and horror, "not having enough comedy to explore the premise properly, and not enough suspense to provide much drama". However, both Persky and Campbell were praised for their acting, despite the perceived shallowness of the latter's character. David Wharton of Cinema Blend called Campbell's performance "lowkey" and subtle, commenting that he portrayed Weinsider "a bit less madcap than many of the roles that he's known for". Wharton praised the casting, describing it as "against type", which he claimed worked well because the material of the episode was more serious and dramatic than usual for the series.

Todd VanDerWerff from "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a "B". He praised Campbell's acting, calling him "the best thing about" the installment, and complimented the entry's general concept. VanDerWerff stated that after several humorous stories in a row, "Terms of Endearment" was a "return to form" for the series, bringing the season back to the more straightforward monster-of-the-week format. VanDerWerff did, however, note that the episode's biggest weaknesses were its limited use of Scully and its over-the-top use of Spender as a villain. Another critic from "The A.V. Club", Zack Handlen, commented that "Terms of Endearment" was notably more influenced by horror than the following week's "<a href="The%20Rain%20King">The Rain King</a>". Edward Olivier of The Celebrity Cafe stated that the installment strayed away from regular "X-Files" formula, showcasing Campbell in a "major role".

Retrospective reviews of "Terms of Endearment" with regards to the series as a whole were mixed. In a run-down of "The X-Files" guest stars who left a lasting impression, Lana Berkowitz from the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" included Campbell, calling him the "demon who wants to be a father." Christine Seghers of "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" described the entry as a "creepy standout" from the sixth season, and named Campbell's guest appearance as the sixth best of the series. Campbell's performance was called "moving" by Seghers, who viewed that Campbell managed to deliver a performance that "completely shed his trademark snark". "Cinefantastique" later named the dream sequence from "Terms of Endearment" as the ninth scariest moment in "The X-Files". Andrew Payne from "Starpulse" cited the episode as the second most disappointing of the series, calling the premise "lame". Payne stated that only "<a href="Chinga%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Chinga</a>", an episode written by author <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>, wasted its potential more.

Following his involvement with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender for the role of <a href="John%20Doggett">John Doggett</a>, a character that would appear in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a>. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series "<a href="Jack%20of%20All%20Trades%20%28TV%20series%29">Jack of All Trades</a>". On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, "I had worked on an "X-Files" episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." The character was eventually portrayed by actor <a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>. Later in Campbell's novel "<a href="Make%20Love%21%20The%20Bruce%20Campbell%20Way">Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way</a>", he joked that Patrick "stiffed him out of the role".

"Terms of Endearment" was the first entry of the series written by Amann, who beforehand had unsuccessfully pitched several ideas for the show. Based on the success of this episode, Amann went on to write several more episodes for the series, such as "<a href="Agua%20Mala">Agua Mala</a>" later in the same season. During the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">ninth season</a>, Amann became one of the main supervising producers and had writing involvement in several episodes, most notably "<a href="Release%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Release</a>" and "<a href="Hellbound%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Hellbound</a>".

Chris Owens, who portrayed Jeffrey Spender on the show, was negatively affected by the episode. Following the premiere of "Terms of Endearment", he received "strange reactions" from people on the street who were displeased with his character. In the series, the character staunchly disbelieves in the paranormal, and tries to remove the initial report about child-abducting demons in the episode, only for it to be salvaged by Mulder and Scully. People were so annoyed by the nature of the character that Owens was pestered during his everyday life; during one incident, a person angrily called him a "paper shredder".

Battle of Tory Island

The Battle of Tory Island (sometimes called the Battle of Donegal, Battle of Lough Swilly or Warren's Action) was a naval action of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, fought on 12 October 1798 between <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> squadrons off the northwest coast of <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a>, then in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Kingdom of Ireland</a>. The last action of the <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>, the Battle of Tory Island ended the final attempt by the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> to land substantial numbers of soldiers in Ireland during the war.

The <a href="Society%20of%20United%20Irishmen">Society of United Irishmen</a>, led by <a href="Theobald%20Wolfe%20Tone">Wolfe Tone</a>, launched an uprising against British rule in Ireland in May 1798. At the request of the rebels, a small French force under <a href="Jean%20Joseph%20Amable%20Humbert">General Humbert</a> was landed at <a href="Killala">Killala</a>, <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, but by early September both this expedition and the rebellion had been defeated. Unaware of Humbert's surrender, the French despatched reinforcements on 16 September. Having missed one invasion force, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> was on alert for another, and when the squadron carrying the reinforcements left <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> they were soon spotted. After a long chase, the French were brought to battle in a bay off the rugged <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a> coast in the west of <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, very close to <a href="Tory%20Island">Tory Island</a>. During the action the outnumbered French attempted to escape, but were run down and defeated piecemeal, with the British capturing four ships and scattering the survivors. Over the next fortnight, British frigate patrols scoured the passage back to Brest, capturing three more ships. Of the ten ships in the original French squadron, only two frigates and a schooner reached safety. British losses in the campaign were minimal.

The battle marked the last attempt by the French Navy to launch an invasion of any part of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. It also ended the last hopes the United Irishmen had of obtaining outside support in their struggle with the British. After the action, Tone was recognised aboard the captured French flagship and arrested. He was brought ashore by the British at <a href="Buncrana">Buncrana</a>, on the <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> <a href="Peninsula">Peninsula</a>. He was later tried for treason, convicted, and committed suicide while in prison in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, hours before he was to be hanged.

<a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a>'s enemies in <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops there was a popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect the support of a large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. Additionally, embroiling the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.

The rhetoric of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> inspired many Irishmen to fight for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. With these goals in mind, in 1791 <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> lawyer <a href="Theobald%20Wolfe%20Tone">Wolfe Tone</a> founded the <a href="Society%20of%20United%20Irishmen">Society of United Irishmen</a>. Allying itself with the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a>, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a> to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful would strike a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even severe enough to force Britain to seek peace.

French political divisions made organising an operation against Ireland difficult. The process was further hampered by the French Atlantic Fleet's defeat in 1794 at the <a href="Glorious%20First%20of%20June">Glorious First of June</a> and the disastrous <a href="Croisi%C3%A8re%20du%20Grand%20Hiver">Croisière du Grand Hiver</a> operation in 1795. Having lost many of its best officers during the political purges of <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">The Terror</a>, these defeats bred a negative mentality in the French Navy, discouraging adventurous strategic thinking. Eventually, the "<a href="Exp%C3%A9dition%20d%27Irlande">Expédition d'Irlande</a>" was despatched in December 1796 under <a href="Admiral%20%28France%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Justin%20Bonaventure%20Morard%20de%20Galles">Morard de Galles</a>, consisting of 17 <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and 27 smaller vessels, and carrying as many as 25,000 men. Despite elements of the force spending up to a week in <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a>, not a single French soldier was successfully landed, and the expedition was a total disaster, with 13 ships lost and over 2,000 men drowned.

The following year, Tone and his companions tried again, this time persuading the government of the <a href="Batavian%20Republic">Batavian Republic</a>, which was under French occupation, to prepare their own expedition. During 1797, the Dutch fleet was readied and provisioned, intending to combine with the French fleet and launch a second invasion attempt. The Batavian fleet sailed on a preparatory raiding cruise in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> in October 1797 and on their return were confronted off the Dutch coast by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet under <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Adam%20Duncan%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Duncan%20of%20Camperdown">Sir Adam Duncan</a>. Duncan immediately attacked, and in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Camperdown">Battle of Camperdown</a> captured or destroyed ten ships and scattered the rest, ending the Batavian invasion threat.

Hoping to capitalise on the spontaneous uprising that spread across Ireland in May 1798, <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Daniel%20Savary">Daniel Savary</a> led a third, and more successful, effort. He took a small frigate squadron flying false British colours to <a href="Killala">Killala</a>, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under <a href="Jean%20Joseph%20Amable%20Humbert">General Humbert</a>. A larger force would have been despatched, but the French had been caught unprepared—the Irish rebellion had originally been planned to coincide with a later French landing, but British intelligence operations had infiltrated the United Irishmen and arrested much of its leadership, prompting a precipitate revolt. Although the uprising achieved some early successes, by the time Humbert arrived its outcome had already been decided with the defeat of successive rebel armies by British troops. Humbert's force was joined by many United Irishmen and had some initial success, but was unable to face superior British numbers at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ballinamuck">Battle of Ballinamuck</a>, and surrendered on 8 September. Although its small size allowed it to reach Ireland unobserved, neither Savary's frigate squadron nor the army it carried were large enough to have a significant impact on the campaign.

Unaware that Humbert had surrendered and the rebellion been defeated, the French prepared a follow-up expedition under the command of <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Jean-Baptiste-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bompart">Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart</a>. Three thousand men were embarked aboard the ship of the line <a href="HMS%20Donegal%20%281798%29">"Hoche"</a> and eight frigates, the force departing Brest on 16 September. However, having missed Savary's frigate squadron, the Royal Navy were more watchful; roving frigate patrols cruised off the principal French ports and in the approaches to Ireland, while squadrons of battleships from the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> sailed nearby, ready to move against any new invasion force. In command of the squadron on the Irish station was <a href="Commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Sir%20John%20Borlase%20Warren%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Borlase Warren</a>, a highly experienced officer (and politician) who had made a name for himself raiding the French coast early in the war.

Bompart's squadron departed Brest late in the evening, hoping to slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Richard%20Goodwin%20Keats">Richard Goodwin Keats</a>, in <a href="HMS%20Boadicea%20%281797%29">HMS "Boadicea"</a>. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering <a href="HMS%20Ethalion%20%281797%29">HMS "Ethalion"</a> under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="George%20Countess">George Countess</a> and the brig <a href="HMS%20Sylph">HMS "Sylph"</a> under <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commander</a> <a href="John%20Chambers%20White">John Chambers White</a> to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bridport">Lord Bridport</a>, admiral of the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a>.

Aware of the British pursuit, Bompart nevertheless continued to the north. Countess followed closely, and was joined on 18 September by <a href="HMS%20Amelia%20%281796%29">HMS "Amelia"</a> under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Charles%20Herbert%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Charles Herbert</a>. Initially north of the French, "Amelia" had spotted the chase the previous day and caught up during the night by passing silently through Bompart's squadron. The next day, Bompart attempted to throw off his pursuers by <a href="feint">feint</a>ing towards <a href="Lorient">Lorient</a>, and again the following day by feinting south, as if travelling towards the Antilles. However, the British captains remained on track, and by 20 September were only nine miles from Bompart's force, which was continuing south-west as though sailing for the Americas. <a href="HMS%20Anson%20%281781%29">HMS "Anson"</a>, a large <a href="razee">razee</a> frigate under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Philip%20Charles%20Durham">Philip Charles Durham</a>, joined the British force on 20 September.

Despite Bompart's attempts to disguise his destination, by the evening of 23 September Countess had correctly deduced the French were heading for Ireland, and despatched the <a href="brig">brig</a> "Sylph" to warn Commodore Warren and any other British ships she came across. Two days later, on 25 September, Commodore Bompart was forced to haul to the east and lose ground to his pursuers when a 100-ship British convoy passed to the north. This convoy consisted of many well-armed <a href="East%20Indiaman">East Indiamen</a>, protected by several frigates, and posed a serious threat to Bompart's overloaded ships. He then tried to drive off pursuit by feinting towards Countess's squadron, but the faster British ships simply withdrew to a safe distance, resuming their chase once the French had returned to their original course. On 29 September Bompart made a final bid to shake his pursuers; he attempted to engage the British frigates with three of his own—<a href="French%20frigate%20Immortalit%C3%A9%20%281795%29">"Immortalité"</a>, <a href="French%20frigate%20Loire%20%281796%29">"Loire"</a> and another. This plan failed after his flagship "Hoche" lost a topmast in heavy weather and fell behind the rest of the squadron, forcing the frigates to return to her protection.

Unable to escape, Bompart finally abandoned his pretence of sailing for the Americas and instead turned north-west. During the next day high winds cost both "Hoche" and "Anson" a topmast, slowing both squadrons, but the repairs to "Hoche" were conducted faster and the French were able to pull ahead. For four more days pursuit continued directly north, until 4 October, when a storm descended and Bompart successfully outran Countess in the increasing darkness. In the high winds, "Amelia" was driven off course and away from her compatriots on 7 October while "Anson" again suffered damage, this time losing two topmasts.

On 11 October the weather cleared, and spotting two sails to the south, Countess took "Ethalion" to investigate. The ships were "Amelia" and a ship of the line of Warren's squadron, who having received "Sylph"'s warning on 23 September, was sailing north in an attempt to intercept the French. Warren's squadron of three ships of the line and the <a href="razee">razee</a> frigate <a href="HMS%20Magnanime%20%281780%29">HMS "Magnanime"</a> had been joined the day before by two additional frigates stationed at <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>; <a href="HMS%20Melampus%20%281785%29">HMS "Melampus"</a> under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Graham%20Moore%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Graham Moore</a> and <a href="HMS%20Doris%20%281795%29">HMS "Doris"</a> under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Charles%20Jones%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Ranelagh">Lord Ranelagh</a>. Warren attached "Melampus" to his squadron and detached "Doris" to scout along the Irish coast and warn the British garrisons, especially along the coast of <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a> and the North-West of Ireland region generally. "Doris" was also to scout along part of the coast of the West of Ireland region, further south, where the previous French landing had been effected at <a href="Killala">Killala</a>.

Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made directly for <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a> where the landing was scheduled to take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site but was unable to find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to <a href="Tory%20Island">Tory Island</a>, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.

Throughout the day, Warren's squadron closed from the north-east while Bompart made frantic efforts to reach open water. Both fleets were hindered by a <a href="gale">gale</a> which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of "Hoche"'s <a href="topmast">topmast</a>s were blown down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and forcing them to hold back in her defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French <a href="French%20frigate%20R%C3%A9solue%20%281778%29">"Résolue"</a> sprang a severe leak and HMS "Anson" lost her <a href="mizzenmast">mizzenmast</a> and several topmasts.
During the night, Bompart attempted to decoy the British by sending the schooner <a href="French%20ship%20Biche%20%281798%29">"Biche"</a> with orders for the frigate "Résolue", commanding <a href="Ship-of-the-line%20captain">Captain</a> Jean-Pierre Bargeau to beach his ship and fire flares in the hope of distracting Warren from his pursuit. For unknown reasons this order was never carried out, and in the morning Warren was still hard behind Bompart, whose ships were now sailing in two uneven lines. Warren's force was even more dispersed, with <a href="HMS%20Robust%20%281764%29">HMS "Robust"</a> and HMS "Magnanime" astern of the French and gaining fast, "Amelia" and "Melampus" shortly behind them and Warren's flagship <a href="HMS%20Canada%20%281765%29">HMS "Canada"</a> with <a href="HMS%20Foudroyant%20%281798%29">HMS "Foudroyant"</a> under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Byard">Sir Thomas Byard</a>, <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Kt.</a>, from the enemy. The other British ships were scattered throughout this formation except "Anson", which was wallowing to the rear, far out of sight.
Realising that he could not escape and would have to fight his way past the British, Bompart formed his squadron into a battleline and turned westwards, waiting for Warren's signal for the attack. Because of the dispersed nature of his squadron, Warren did not issue this signal until 07:00, when he ordered "Robust" to steer for the French line and attack "Hoche" directly. <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Edward%20Thornbrough">Edward Thornbrough</a> of "Robust" obeyed immediately and closed with the French, firing into the frigates <a href="French%20frigate%20Embuscade%20%281789%29">"Embuscade"</a> and <a href="French%20frigate%20Coquille%20%281794%29">"Coquille"</a> as he passed, before closing with "Hoche" and, at 08:50, beginning a bitter close-range artillery duel. Minutes later "Magnanime" joined the action, firing on the rear frigates and engaging the French van of "Immortalité", "Loire" and <a href="French%20frigate%20Bellone%20%281778%29">"Bellone"</a>, which had <a href="Jibe%20%28sailing%29">worn</a> out of the line in an attempt to <a href="raking%20fire">rake</a> her. The next three British ships into action, "Ethalion", "Melampus" and "Amelia", all raked the isolated "Hoche" as they passed, before pressing on sail to pursue the French frigates, now making distance to the south-west. "Canada" and the subsequent British ships all ignored "Hoche" except to fire a few distant shots. By the time they passed, the ship was clearly a wreck, having been pounded repeatedly by "Robust" and "Magnanime". Bompart finally surrendered at 10:50 with 270 of his crew and passengers killed or wounded.

"Embuscade" was the next to surrender, having been battered in the opening exchanges by "Magnanime", and further damaged by long-range fire from "Foudroyant" during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, <a href="Ship-of-the-line%20captain">Captain</a> de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. "Magnanime", suffering the effects of her engagement with "Hoche", took possession of "Embuscade" and continued to follow slowly behind the rest of the fleet, while "Robust", which had suffered severely in her duel with "Hoche", remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took them across the path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the "Foudroyant". Most of the frigates were able outrun this ponderous enemy, but "Bellone" was less fortunate and a speculative shot from the battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by "Melampus" and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling "Coquille" surrendered after being outrun by the approaching "Canada"; Warren ordered the slowly following "Magnanime" to take possession.

"Ethalion" took over pursuit of "Bellone" from "Melampus", and for two hours maintained continuous fire with her <a href="Chase%20gun">bow-chasers</a> on the French ship. "Ethalion" was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with "Bellone" during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered "Bellone" eventually surrendered. "Hoche" apart, "Bellone" had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling "Anson" discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach as he had been too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on "Loire". The damaged "Anson" was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.

By nightfall some of the remaining French ships had entered <a href="Donegal%20Bay">Donegal Bay</a> with "Canada", "Melampus" and "Foudroyant" still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed one another in the dark, and "Canada" almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered "Robust" to tow "Hoche" into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as "Robust" was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, "Hoche" lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, "Doris" appeared and took "Hoche" in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, "Ethalion" saw "Bellone" safely into port, and "Magnanime" and "Amelia" brought in "Coquille" and "Embuscade" respectively.

On the morning of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates standing out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in "Melampus" to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, "Melampus" scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 was surprised by the sudden appearance directly in front of her of "Immortalité" and "Résolue" near St. John's Point. "Immortalité" soon spotted "Melampus" and made sail, but <a href="Ship-of-the-line%20captain">Captain</a> Bargeau of "Résolue" had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. In the gloom and confusion, he mistook "Melampus" for "Immortalité" and came alongside, only realising his mistake when "Melampus" opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, "Résolue"'s guns had been tied down below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. "Melampus" put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of "Immortalité".

"Loire" and "<a href="French%20frigate%20S%C3%A9millante%20%281792%29">Sémillante</a>" had escaped from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate squadron under <a href="James%20Newman-Newman">James Newman-Newman</a> rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered <a href="HMS%20R%C3%A9volutionnaire%20%281794%29">HMS "Révolutionaire"</a> to focus on "Sémillante" whilst he pursued "Loire" in <a href="HMS%20Mermaid%20%281782%29">HMS "Mermaid"</a>, accompanied by the brig <a href="HMS%20Kangaroo%20%281795%29">HMS "Kangaroo"</a> under <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commander</a> <a href="Edward%20Brace">Edward Brace</a>. "Loire" and "Sémillante" separated to divide their pursuers; "Mermaid" and "Kangaroo" lost track of "Loire" in the early evening, and "Sémillante" evaded "Révolutionaire" after dark.

However, on the morning of 16 October Newman spotted "Loire" on the horizon and immediately ordered his ships in pursuit. "Loire" was faster than "Mermaid" in the high winds but was unable to outrun "Kangaroo", which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between the combatants was greatly unbalanced, and "Kangaroo" eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. "Loire" too had been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage "Mermaid"—by then the only pursuer still within reach.

"Mermaid" and "Loire" joined battle at 07:00, and the artillery exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by "Loire" was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, "Mermaid" knocking away several of her opponent's spars, but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the "Loire". At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from "Loire" brought down "Mermaid's" mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered "Loire" disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear the wreckage of the mast. High winds further hampered "Mermaid's" repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time "Mermaid" was ready for action once more, "Loire" had escaped.

Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS "Anson" was revealed only a short distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham was not prepared to lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on "Loire", which was unable to escape. Accompanying "Anson" was "Kangaroo", recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, "Anson" and "Loire" began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. "Kangaroo" closed on the unprotected stern of "Loire", firing as she did so and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 "Loire" had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.

The four remaining survivors of the French fleet had mostly avoided pursuit, and by 19 October were nearing Brest independently, hoping to slip through the tight British blockade around the harbour. Captain Mathieu-Charles Bergevin on "Romaine" had attempted to land the troops aboard his ship in Ireland on 13 October, but was forced to abandon this plan when the soldiers refused to be put ashore. He then sailed southwest and successfully avoided all contact with British forces, joining with the schooner "Biche" and arriving at Brest on 23 October. The same day, after outrunning "Révolutionaire's" pursuit, "Sémillante" arrived in <a href="Lorient">Lorient</a>—the last French ship to return home.

<a href="French%20frigate%20Immortalit%C3%A9%20%281795%29">"Immortalité"</a> almost reached safety. On the morning of 20 October, <a href="Ship-of-the-line%20captain">Captain</a> Jean-François Legrand was approaching Brest when he was spotted by <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Thomas%20Byam%20Martin">Thomas Byam Martin</a> of <a href="HMS%20Fisgard%20%281797%29">HMS "Fisgard"</a>. "Fisgard", part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. "Immortalité" initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster "Fisgard" at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, "Fisgard" took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. "Immortalité", which had lost a mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard "Immortalité" were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and <a href="General%20officer">General</a> Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. "Fisgard", with the aid of other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.

The French high command had not been idle during the destruction of their invasion force, and had prepared and despatched a second squadron of four frigates under <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Daniel%20Savary">Daniel Savary</a>. This force was initially ordered to support Bompart, but was later tasked with escorting the squadron's survivors back to France. On 27 October, Savary learnt of the destruction of both Bompart's squadron and the Irish rebellion from sympathetic locals at Killala, and turned immediately south, hoping to avoid a similar fate. However, on 28 October, he was spotted by a three-ship squadron under <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="James%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a>, which included two ships of the line. Saumarez immediately gave chase, and the squadrons exchanged long-distance cannon fire throughout the day. Late in the evening Saumarez's flagship <a href="HMS%20Caesar%20%281793%29">HMS "Caesar"</a> lost its foretopmast in strong winds, and command passed to <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Bickerton%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Richard Bickerton</a>, 2nd <a href="Baronet">Bt.</a>, in <a href="HMS%20Terrible%20%281785%29">HMS "Terrible"</a>.

After another day's chase, late on 29 October Savary divided his squadron, sending two frigates to the south east and turning north west with two more. In response, Bickerton split his force, sending the frigate <a href="HMS%20Melpomene%20%281794%29">HMS "Melpomene"</a> after the southern group and following Savary himself in "Terrible". By 30 October, both British ships were within of their opponents and were preparing for action, when at 17:00 a severe storm lashed the area. Savary's ships had been extending their pursuit by throwing guns, horses and equipment overboard in an effort to lighten their ships, and were consequently better suited to the high winds. The heavier British ships were unable to match their opponents' speed and fell behind. When the weather cleared, the French ships were out of sight, and all four eventually returned independently to Brest, ending the final French attempt to invade Ireland.

An abortive effort to support the French invasion fleet was also made by the Navy of the <a href="Batavian%20Republic">Batavian Republic</a>, which despatched the small frigates <a href="Dutch%20frigate%20Furie">"Furie"</a> and <a href="Dutch%20frigate%20Waakzaamheid">"Waakzaamheid"</a> to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October. Within hours of leaving port, both these ships were intercepted and captured by the British frigate <a href="HMS%20Sirius%20%281797%29">HMS "Sirius"</a> under the young <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Sir%20Richard%20King%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Richard King</a> at the <a href="Action%20of%2024%20October%201798">Action of 24 October 1798</a>.

Savary's return to port marked the end of the last attempt by a continental nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of <a href="Theobald%20Wolfe%20Tone">Wolfe Tone</a> himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from "Hoche" at <a href="Buncrana">Buncrana</a>. Tone was charged with treason and sentenced to death, though he committed suicide in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> before the sentence could be carried out.

In <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a> the engagement was considered a great success, with the thanks of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament</a> bestowed on the entire force. Numerous junior officers were promoted and all crew members received financial rewards from the sale of the captured vessels. Of these prizes, "Immortalité" and "Loire" were purchased and served in the Royal Navy under their own names for many years, while "Hoche" and "Embuscade" were renamed <a href="HMS%20Donegal%20%281798%29">HMS "Donegal"</a> and HMS "Ambuscade" respectively. "Coquille" was intended for purchase but suffered a catastrophic ammunition explosion in December 1798, which killed 13 people and totally destroyed the vessel. The last two prizes, "Résolue" and "Bellone", were deemed too old and damaged to be worthy of active service. They were, however, purchased by the Royal Navy to provide their captors with <a href="prize%20money">prize money</a>, "Bellone" becoming <a href="HMS%20Proserpine">HMS "Proserpine"</a> and "Résolue" becoming <a href="HMS%20Resolue">HMS "Resolue"</a>. Both ships served as harbour vessels for some years until they were broken up. Five decades later, the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasp, "12th October 1798", attached to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

. The actual line and direction of the British approach has not been conclusively established due to the vagueness of Warren's post-battle report. Richard Brooks discusses these discrepancies and concludes that Warren's squadron, although widely dispersed, was probably approaching from approximately the north-west, from the North Atlantic towards Ireland.

Edmund Sharpe

Edmund Sharpe (31 October 1809 – 8 May 1877) was an English architect, <a href="architectural%20historian">architectural historian</a>, railway engineer, and <a href="Sanitary%20engineering">sanitary</a> reformer. Born in <a href="Knutsford">Knutsford</a>, Cheshire, he was educated first by his parents and then at schools locally and in <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> and <a href="Sedbergh">Sedbergh</a>. Following his graduation from <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> he was awarded a travelling scholarship, enabling him to study architecture in Germany and southern France. In 1835 he established an architectural practice in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a>, initially working on his own. In 1845 he entered into partnership with <a href="Edward%20Graham%20Paley">Edward Paley</a>, one of his pupils. Sharpe's main focus was on churches, and he was a pioneer in the use of <a href="Architectural%20terracotta">terracotta</a> as a structural material in church building, designing what were known as "pot" churches, the first of which was <a href="St%20Stephen%20and%20All%20Martyrs%27%20Church%2C%20Lever%20Bridge">St Stephen and All Martyrs' Church, Lever Bridge</a>.

He also designed secular buildings, including residential buildings and schools, and worked on the development of railways in north-west England, designing bridges and planning new lines. In 1851 he resigned from his architectural practice, and in 1856 he moved from Lancaster, spending the remainder of his career mainly as a railway engineer, first in North Wales, then in Switzerland and southern France. Sharpe returned to England in 1866 to live in <a href="Scotforth">Scotforth</a> near Lancaster, where he designed a final church near to his home.

While working in his architectural practice, Sharpe was involved in Lancaster's civic affairs. He was an elected <a href="town%20councillor">town councillor</a> and served as mayor in 1848–49. Concerned about the town's poor water supply and sanitation, he championed the construction of new sewers and a waterworks. He was a talented musician, and took part in the artistic, literary, and scientific activities in the town. Also an accomplished sportsman, he took an active interest in archery, rowing and cricket.

Sharpe achieved national recognition as an architectural historian. He published books of detailed architectural drawings, wrote a number of articles on architecture, devised a scheme for the classification of <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">English Gothic architectural</a> styles, and in 1875 was awarded the <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>. He was critical of much of the <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restoration</a> of <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> churches that had become a major occupation of contemporary architects. Towards the end of his career Sharpe organised expeditions to study and draw buildings in England and France. While on such an expedition to Italy in 1877, he was taken ill and died. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried. Sharpe's legacy consists of about 40 extant churches; railway features, including the <a href="Conwy%20Valley%20Line">Conwy Valley Line</a> and bridges on what is now the Lancashire section of the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a>; and his archive of architectural books, articles and drawings.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in <a href="Knutsford">Knutsford</a>, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Knutsford">Knutsford parish church</a>, came from <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a> in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future <a href="Elizabeth%20Gaskell">Mrs Gaskell</a>. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a> with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.

Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became <a href="Head%20Girl%20and%20Head%20Boy">head boy</a>. In August 1827 he moved to <a href="Sedbergh%20School">Sedbergh School</a> (then in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, now in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a> as a <a href="Roger%20Lupton">Lupton</a> scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College</a>, <a href="William%20Whewell">William Whewell</a>, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29">MA</a> in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> and early <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a>. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to "fatigue and illness". Edmund returned home to Lancaster late in 1835, having by then decided to become an architect. In December he wrote a letter to William Whewell saying that he had "finally determined to adopt the Profession of Architecture". Some sources state that Sharpe was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> to the architect <a href="Thomas%20Rickman">Thomas Rickman</a>. Sharpe did visit Rickman for a few days in 1832 and corresponded with him later. He may have been "acting as a research assistant" while on the Continent, but Hughes states "there is no evidence to suggest that Sharpe spent more time with Rickman, or served any kind of formal apprenticeship with him".

Edmund Sharpe started his practice at the end of 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in St Leonard's Gate large enough to accommodate himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, <a href="John%20Douglas%20%28architect%29">John Douglas</a> joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed with the firm until about 1859, when he moved to <a href="Chester">Chester</a> to establish his own practice. Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.

In his letter of December 1835 to William Whewell, Sharpe also mentioned that plans for at least one church, <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Blackburn">St Mark's</a> at Witton, west of <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, were already well advanced, and that he was working towards another one, <a href="St%20Saviour%27s%20Church%2C%20Cuerden">St Saviour's</a> near <a href="Bamber%20Bridge">Bamber Bridge</a>, south of <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a>. In addition, he was in contact with the <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a> with a view to designing a church for him near his seat at <a href="Knowsley%2C%20Merseyside">Knowsley</a>, northeast of <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.

Four of Sharpe's earliest churches – <a href="St%20Saviour%27s%20Church%2C%20Cuerden">St Saviour, Bamber Bridge</a> (1836–37); <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Blackburn">St Mark, Witton</a> (1836–38);. <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Chatburn">Christ Church, Chatburn</a> (1837–38); and <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Farington">St Paul, Farington</a>, near <a href="Leyland%2C%20Lancashire">Leyland</a> (1839–40) – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because "no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque". They "turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'... with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged". The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements were the chapel of All Saints, <a href="Marthall">Marthall</a>, near Knutsford (1839); <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Conistone">St Mary, Conistone</a> in <a href="Wharfedale">Wharfedale</a> (1846); and <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Scotforth">St Paul, Scotforth</a> in south Lancaster (1874), the last built towards the end of his life.
By 1838 Sharpe had begun to experiment with elements of English Gothic architecture, initially in the <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Early%20English%20Gothic">Early English</a> style and in particular the <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a>, dating from the early 12th century or earlier. The first church he built in this style was <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Cowgill">St John the Evangelist, Cowgill</a>, <a href="Dent%2C%20Cumbria">Dent</a>, (1837–38), followed closely by <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Howgill">Holy Trinity, Howgill</a> (1837–38), and then by several others in the same style. He was soon incorporating elements from later styles of English Gothic architecture, and by 1839 was designing churches using <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Perpendicular%20Gothic">Perpendicular</a> features, as at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Stainforth">St Peter, Stainforth</a> (1839–42), <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Bretherton">St John the Baptist, Bretherton</a>, and <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Mawdesley">St Peter, Mawdesley</a> (both 1839–40).

Sharpe was one of the architects who designed churches for the Church Building Commission, which had been established by the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824. The resulting churches have been called <a href="Commissioners%27%20church">Commissioners' church</a>es, and were built to provide places of worship in newly populated areas. Sharpe designed six churches for the Commission: <a href="St%20John%27s%20Church%2C%20Dukinfield">St John, Dukinfield</a>, <a href="St%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Stalybridge">St George, Stalybridge</a> (both 1838–40), St John the Baptist, Bretherton, St Paul, Farington, <a href="St%20Catharine%27s%20Church%2C%20Scholes">St Catharine, Scholes</a> (near <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a>; 1839–41), and <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Blackburn">Holy Trinity, Blackburn</a> (1837–46).He is also credited with the design of <a href="St.%20Bridget%20Beckermet">St. Bridgets, Beckermet, Cumberland</a> (1842–43).

Although some architects designed the earlier Commissioners' churches in <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> style, most were in <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style. The earliest of the Gothic Revival churches were based loosely on the Early English style, with single or paired lancet windows between <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es in the sides of the church, and stepped triple lancets at the east end. Others were in a "stilted Perpendicular" style, with "thin west towers, thin buttresses, fat <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s, and interiors with three galleries and plaster <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaults</a>". These features were only loosely derived from medieval Gothic architecture, and were not true representations of it. A major influence on the subsequent development of the Gothic Revival was <a href="Augustus%20Welby%20Northmore%20Pugin">AWN Pugin</a> (1812–52) and, influenced by him, the <a href="Cambridge%20Camden%20Society">Cambridge Camden Society</a> (later named the Ecclesiological Society). Among other things, they argued that not only should Gothic be the only right and proper style for churches, but that their features should be accurate representations of that style; they should be "correct" Gothic features, rather than being loosely derived from the style. The term "pre-archaeological" was used to describe churches designed using features only loosely derived from true Gothic.

Sharpe's early Gothic Revival works were pre-archaeological, including <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Blackburn">Holy Trinity, Blackburn</a>, built in 1837–46 for <a href="John%20William%20Whittaker">Revd JW Whittaker</a>. Hughes expresses the opinion that this church is Sharpe's "pièce de resistance", it contains "a mongrel mix of Gothic styles". Simultaneously Sharpe was involved in the design of about twelve more churches in Northwest England, which increasingly incorporated more "correct" Gothic features. In 1841 he obtained a contract to build three churches and associated structures (vicarages and schools) for the <a href="River%20Weaver">Weaver Navigation</a> Trustees, at Weston Point, <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>; Castle, <a href="Northwich">Northwich</a>; and <a href="Winsford">Winsford</a>. All three were in Cheshire, and built between 1841 and 1844. Between 1835 and 1842 Sharpe designed about 30 new churches in Lancashire and Cheshire, all to a low budget, and all to a degree pre-archaeological. In 1843 Sharpe was able to fulfil his promise to build a church for the Earl of Derby; this was <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Knowsley">St Mary, Knowsley</a>, which was completed and consecrated the following year. It is described by Hughes as "one of Sharpe's loveliest creations". About the same time he designed a new steeple for <a href="St%20Michael%27s%20Church%2C%20Kirkham">St Michael, Kirkham</a>; the steeple and St Mary's Church contained much more in the way of "correct" Gothic features, and both were praised by the Camden Society in "The Ecclesiologist".
In the early 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, to build a church near Fletcher's home in <a href="Little%20Bolton">Little Bolton</a>. Fletcher was the owner of a <a href="Ladyshore%20Colliery">coal mine at Ladyshore</a>, <a href="Little%20Lever">Little Lever</a>, overlooking the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a> and the <a href="Manchester%2C%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal">Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal</a>. He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make <a href="Fire%20brick">refractory bricks</a> for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (<a href="terracotta">terracotta</a>), <a href="St%20Stephen%20and%20All%20Martyrs%27%20Church%2C%20Lever%20Bridge">St Stephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge</a> (1842–44). As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, "the pot churches", a nickname that has stuck. The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its sturdiness as a building material, and the fact that it could be moulded into almost any shape. It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and <a href="arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a> in a church, for the detailed decoration of <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> and <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s, and also, as at St Stephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>, <a href="baptismal%20font">font</a>, organ case, and the pew ends. Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, St Stephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta. The following year, a second church was built using the same material, <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Platt%20Church">Trinity Church, Rusholme</a>, south of Manchester (1845–46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby <a href="Platt%20Fields%20Park%23Platt%20Hall">Platt Hall</a>. In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.
Towards the end of his life, Sharpe designed one more church incorporating terracotta, St Paul, Scotforth, Lancaster (1874–76). For this he returned to the Romanesque style, and used terracotta as a building and a decorative material. By this time he was living in <a href="Scotforth">Scotforth</a>, then a separate village to the south of Lancaster, but now absorbed into the city. The new church was built within of his home, and again terracotta was not the only material used. It is used for the dressings, windows, doorways, the upper part of the tower, and internally for the <a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> and arches of the aisle arcades, but the walls are of stone.

During his time as an architect Sharpe was also involved in the building, repair, and restoration of non-ecclesiastic structures, including houses and bridges. In 1837 he was appointed bridgemaster for the <a href="Lonsdale%20%28hundred%29">Hundred of Lonsdale South of the Sands</a>, and in 1839 he supervised the repair of <a href="Skerton%20Bridge">Skerton Bridge</a> over the <a href="River%20Lune">River Lune</a> in Lancaster. The following year he designed a new bridge over the <a href="River%20Hyndburn">River Hyndburn</a> at Fournessford, a village to the east of <a href="Wray%2C%20Lancashire">Wray</a>. He had also been appointed as architect and superintendent of works for <a href="Lancaster%20Castle">Lancaster Castle</a>, the <a href="Judges%20Lodgings%2C%20Lancaster">Judges' Lodgings</a>, and the County Lunatic Asylum (later the Lancaster Moor Hospital). For the asylum he designed several new wings and a chapel, followed by extensions to the union <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>. Sharpe was also involved in designing and altering several domestic buildings. In 1843 he designed a vicarage in <a href="Cockermouth">Cockermouth</a>, and the following year he started to remodel <a href="Capernwray%20Hall">Capernwray Hall</a>, a <a href="country%20house">country house</a> northeast of Lancaster. In the same year he designed the <a href="Governor%27s%20House%2C%20Knutsford">Governor's House</a> for Knutsford Gaol, and in 1845 he re-designed <a href="Redmarshall%20Old%20Rectory">Redmarshall Old Rectory</a> for the Revd Thomas Austin, father of Sharpe's pupil (also named Thomas). Following Paley's becoming a partner in 1845, the pair worked together to design Lee Bridge in <a href="Over%20Wyresdale">Over Wyresdale</a> (1847), to plan the conversion of a disused manor house into the <a href="Furness%20Abbey%20Hotel">Furness Abbey Hotel</a> (1847), and to arrange the remodelling of <a href="Hornby%20Castle%2C%20Lancashire">Hornby Castle</a> (1847–52). In 1849–50 they planned the rebuilding and enlargement of the Charity School for Girls in Middle Street, Lancaster, followed in 1851 by the National School for Boys in St Leonard's Gate. The practice then made plans for a new building at <a href="Giggleswick%20School">Giggleswick School</a>, and new premises for <a href="Lancaster%20Royal%20Grammar%20School">Lancaster Grammar School</a> in Moor Lane, but by then Sharpe was on the point of withdrawing from the practice, and it is likely that most of the designs were prepared by Paley.

Sharpe studied and wrote about ecclesiastical architecture throughout his adult life, both sketching and measuring historical churches and ruins. This resulted in a systematic series of published drawings in twelve parts between 1845 and 1847 entitled "Architectural Parallels", containing measured drawings of abbey churches in the early Gothic style, and reissued as a single work in 1848. Sharpe intended to produce a further version with text, but this never transpired. Also in 1848 a "Supplement to Architectural Parallels", was published, containing yet more detailed drawings. Simultaneously, Sharpe had produced the two-volume work "Decorated Windows", the first volume being published in 1845, and the second in 1849. The work, which was praised by the art critic <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> in "<a href="The%20Stones%20of%20Venice%20%28book%29">The Stones of Venice</a>", consisted largely of drawings by Sharpe's pupils – Paley, Austin, and R. J. Withers – with text by Sharpe describing and analysing the <a href="tracery">tracery</a> of Gothic windows.

In 1851 Sharpe published a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> entitled "The Seven Periods of English Architecture", a small book of about 50 pages suggesting a new scheme for classifying the styles of English ecclesiastical architecture "from the Heptarchy to the Reformation". It was intended to replace the scheme then in use, which had been proposed in 1817 by Thomas Rickman. Rickman had divided English architecture into "four distinct periods, or styles" which he termed "<a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman</a>", "<a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Early%20English">Early English</a>", "<a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated">Decorated English</a>", and "<a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Perpendicular">Perpendicular English</a>". The Norman style lasting until about 1189, was characterised by its arches usually being semicircular, although sometimes pointed; the ornamentation was "bold and rude". The Early English style, continuing to about 1307, was distinguished by its pointed arches and long narrow windows without <a href="mullion">mullion</a>s. He called the characteristic ornamentation "toothed" because it resembled the teeth of the shark. The following period, the Decorated English lasted until 1377, or possibly 10–15 years later, was characterised by large windows with pointed arches containing mullions, and with <a href="tracery">tracery</a> "in flowing lines forming circles, arches and other figures". There was much ornamentation, carved very delicately. The final period identified by Rickman, the Perpendicular English, lasted until as long as 1630 or 1640. This was distinguished by the mullions and the "ornamental panellings" running in perpendicular lines. The ornamentation was in many cases "so crowded as to destroy the beauty of the design". The carving was again "very delicately executed".

In his classification, Sharpe first identified two main classes, according to whether the arches were "circular" or "pointed". The class characterised by the circular arch was the Romanesque class; that by the pointed arch was the Gothic. He divided the Romanesque class into two periods by date rather than by stylistic differences, the dividing date being 1066; this divided the "Saxon" from the "Norman" stage. Whereas Rickman allowed pointed arches when they occurred in the same building as round arches in his Norman period, Sharpe separated buildings that contained both types of arches into a separate intermediate style, the "Transitional". When it came to the Gothic class, Sharpe identified four styles, in contrast to Rickman's three, using the windows to differentiate between them. The earliest style was characterised by windows resembling a lancet "in its length, breadth, and principal proportions". These windows might be single, or in groups of two, three, five, or seven. This style he termed the "Lancet Period". During the next period, tracery appeared in the windows, and originally consisted of simple geometric forms, in particular the circle. This period he called the "Geometrical Period". Later the tracery became more complex, including the <a href="ogee">ogee</a> curve; the characteristic feature being the "sinuosity of form" in the windows and elsewhere. This Sharpe termed the "Curvilinear Period". Finally, the <a href="transom%20%28architecture%29">transom</a> appeared in the windows, and the curved line in the tracery became replaced by straight lines, an "angularity of form", and a "square edge was preferred". This style he named the "Rectilinear Period". The approximate dates Sharpe gave for his periods were, following 1066, the Norman Period up to 1145, the Transitional Period to 1190, the Lancet Period to 1245, the Geometrical Period to 1315, the Curvilinear Period to 1360, and the Rectilinear Period to 1550.

In comparing the two classifications, Sharpe divides Rickman's Norman period into two, the Norman and the Transitional periods. Then Rickman has three Gothic periods in contrast to Sharpe's four. Comparing the descriptions of the styles and, approximately, the dates, Sharpe's Lancet Period corresponds generally with Rickman's Early English; and Sharpe's Rectilinear Period with Rickman's Perpendicular English. This leaves Rickman's Decorated English style divided into two periods by Sharpe according to the complexity of the tracery, the Geometrical and the Curvilinear Periods. Following the publication of the monograph, Sharpe read a paper to the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> describing his system. The monograph and the paper led to "a bitter controversy". The debate between Sharpe and his followers on one side and supporters of Rickman's scheme on the other was published as a series of letters to the journal "<a href="Building%20%28magazine%29">The Builder</a>" until the editor called a halt to the correspondence.

In the same year as Sharpe's short book, "An Essay on the Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England", a much larger work on essentially the same subject, was published by the distinguished historian <a href="Edward%20Augustus%20Freeman">Edward Augustus Freeman</a>, which proposed the terms "Flowing" and "Flamboyant" (the later already in use in France) where Sharpe used "Curvilinear". Although Rickman's scheme remains in general use, despite recognition of its deficiencies, Sharpe's terms "Geometrical" and "Curvilinear" are very often used in addition to distinguish styles or phases within Rickman's "Decorated". They were used by Francis Bond in his 1905 book "Gothic Architecture in England", and are used in various recent works including the <a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Pevsner Architectural Guides</a>.

In 1869 Sharpe joined the <a href="Architectural%20Association%20School%20of%20Architecture">Architectural Association</a>, established in 1847 "by a group of dissatisfied young architects ... to provide a self-directed, independent education at a time when there was no formal training available". He then proposed and organised a series of six annual expeditions to study and draw buildings in different areas, which took place between 1870 and 1875. In 1870 the expedition was to <a href="Lincoln%2C%20England">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Sleaford">Sleaford</a>, and <a href="Spalding%2C%20Lincolnshire">Spalding</a>; in 1871 to <a href="Ely%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Ely</a>, <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">Lynn</a>, and <a href="Boston%2C%20Lincolnshire">Boston</a>; the following year to <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a>, <a href="Oundle">Oundle</a>, <a href="Wellingborough">Wellingborough</a>, and <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>; and in 1873 to <a href="Grantham">Grantham</a>, <a href="Newark-on-Trent">Newark</a>, <a href="Southwell%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Southwell</a>, <a href="Ashbourne%2C%20Derbyshire">Ashbourne</a>, and <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>. The final two expeditions were to France: in 1874 to the northern part of the country, visiting places around Paris including <a href="Soissons">Soissons</a>, <a href="Laon">Laon</a>, <a href="Reims">Rheims</a>, and <a href="Chartres">Chartres</a>; the following year it was to the <a href="Charente">Charente</a> district of southwest France, including <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme">Angoulême</a>. In 1876 Sharpe gave a lecture on this expedition in London, linking the architecture of the region with <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine architecture</a> elsewhere. Following Sharpe's death in 1877 the Association complied with his wish that the expeditions should be continued; and in 1882 it published "Charente: In Memory of Edmund Sharpe, 1875."

Having been a fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> since 1848, Sharpe was awarded its <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> in 1875. This was presented to him by <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">Sir George Gilbert Scott</a>, largely in recognition of his writings. In addition to those recorded above they include: "The Architectural History of St Mary's Church, New Shoreham" (1861), "An Account of the Churches visited during the Lincoln Excursion of the Architectural Association" (1871), "The Mouldings of the Six Periods of British Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation" (1871–74), "The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period of British Architecture AD 1145–90" (1871), "The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period in Central Germany" (1877), and "The Churches of the Nene Valley, Northamptonshire" (published posthumously in 1880). Other writings by Sharpe were published in "The Builder" and "The Architect". He also delivered papers to the Architectural Association, and to the Royal Institute of British Architects. Among other subjects, he argued for restraint in the use of colour in the decoration of churches, in the painting of walls and the stonework, and in the stained glass. He was very critical of recent <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restorations</a> of medieval churches, which had been a major occupation of architects during the previous 20 years, and was particularly caustic about the removal of <a href="whitewash">whitewash</a> from the interior of churches, and the damage thus caused to the underlying stonework. Between January 1874 and February 1875 Sharpe published "The Architecture of the Cistercians", which dealt in considerable detail with the design and functions of <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> <a href="Monastery">monasteries</a> built in the 12th and 13th centuries in Britain and in Europe, most of which he had visited. In addition, Sharpe attended several meetings of the <a href="Royal%20Archaeological%20Institute">Archaeological Institute</a>, and was a Vice-President of the <a href="British%20Archaeological%20Association">British Archaeological Association</a>.

While Sharpe was designing churches, he was augmenting his income by working as a sub-contractor in building railways. These were the lines between Lancaster and <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a>, Lancaster and <a href="Skipton">Skipton</a>, and between <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Southport">Southport</a>. He first became involved with the <a href="Lancaster%20and%20Preston%20Junction%20Railway">Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway</a> in 1838, two years after <a href="Joseph%20Locke">Joseph Locke</a> was appointed as engineer for the line. Sharpe submitted a tender to supply the masonry work for the "Lancaster Contract", the northern section of the line; and Peter Perry from <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a> submitted a tender for the earthwork. Locke insisted that both earthwork and masonry work should be under one contract, which Perry accepted and subcontracted the masonry work to Sharpe. Subsequently, Perry reneged on his part of the contract, resulting in serious disputes between Sharpe, Locke, and the directors of the railway company concerning the costs involved and the quality of the work. The masonry for this section of the line included 15 under-and-over bridges and the six-arch viaduct over the <a href="River%20Conder">River Conder</a> at <a href="Galgate">Galgate</a>. The eventual outcome of the conflict was that Sharpe was dismissed from the work in 1839 with agreed financial compensation, having built most but not all of these structures.

Sharpe's next venture into railway building came in 1845 when, with others, he promoted the building of a cross-country line from Lancaster to Skipton to join the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. This became known as the <a href="%26quot%3BLittle%26quot%3B%20North%20Western%20Railway">"Little" North Western Railway</a> ("L"NWR), with projected branches joining the <a href="Lancaster%20and%20Carlisle%20Railway">Lancaster and Carlisle Railway</a> (then under construction) at points near <a href="Milnthorpe">Milnthorpe</a> and <a href="Orton%2C%20Eden">Orton</a>. In the event the Milnthorpe branch was dropped during the committee stage of the passage through Parliament of the enabling Bill, leaving the Lancaster and Orton branches intact, parting at <a href="Ingleton%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Ingleton</a> and making much use of the Lune Valley.

About this time, the amount of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining, largely owing to <a href="silt">silt</a>ing up of the River Lune. In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner, and later proposed what became the <a href="Morecambe%20Bay">Morecambe Bay</a> Harbour Project. This planned to build a new port at <a href="Poulton-le-Sands">Poulton-le-Sands</a> (soon to become part of <a href="Morecambe">Morecambe</a>), and link it to Lancaster by means of a <a href="ship%20canal">ship canal</a>. After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive, and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal. An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH&R) received Royal assent in July 1846, the revised plan being to link this line to the "L"NWR at <a href="Lancaster%20Green%20Ayre%20railway%20station">Green Ayre</a>, in the northern part of Lancaster next to the River Lune. A clause in the Act allowed the MH&R to be sold to the "L"NWR, which took place in October. The parts played by Sharpe in all of this financial manoeuvring were conflicting and complex: he was simultaneously a Port Commissioner, a Town Councillor, a member of the board of the Morecambe Bay Harbour Company, and Secretary to the "L"NWR. In 1847, near the Morecambe terminus of the railway, Sharpe laid the first stone of the North Western Hotel (later the <a href="Midland%20Hotel%2C%20Morecambe">Midland</a>), which he (or more probably Paley) had designed. In April that year Sharpe had resigned as Secretary to the "L"NWR to enable him to tender for building the line from Morecambe to <a href="Wennington%2C%20Lancashire">Wennington</a>, a village north-east of Lancaster near to the Yorkshire border. His tender of £100,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) for the line (excluding the bridge over the River Lune at Green Ayre) was accepted. He also gained the contract for building the harbour. In June 1848 the section of line from Lancaster to Morecambe was opened, and by October 1849 the ten-mile section from Lancaster to Wennington was completed. In September Sharpe had also resigned as a director of the "L"NWR to become its traffic manager, and was then contracted to manufacture and supply <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a> for the railway, something for which he had neither expertise nor previous experience. By February 1851 the line was experiencing difficulties, its traffic being less than expected and its costs rising; and in December Sharpe was given notice that his contract with the company would be curtailed the following month.

Sharpe then turned his attention to the <a href="Liverpool%2C%20Crosby%20and%20Southport%20Railway">Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway</a> (LCSR) and acted as its company secretary. When in 1854 the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> discontinued leasing its rolling stock to the LCSR, Sharpe arranged the manufacture of its own locomotives and carriages. Also in 1854 he submitted proposals for a branch line running from <a href="Bootle">Bootle</a> to the North Docks in Liverpool, part of which was built in March 1855, though the project was never completed.

In early 1856 Sharpe moved with his family to Llanrwst, North Wales with the intention of building a railway along the <a href="River%20Conwy">Conwy Valley</a>. The <a href="Prospectus%20%28finance%29">prospectus</a> for a line running from <a href="Conwy">Conwy</a> to <a href="Llanrwst">Llanrwst</a> was published in 1858, with Sharpe named as its engineer. The intention for the full line was to build it from the <a href="Chester%20and%20Holyhead%20Railway">Chester and Holyhead Railway</a> to <a href="Betws-y-Coed">Betws-y-Coed</a>, passing through Llanrwst; it would be long, with a gauge of . A series of discussions and negotiations followed, resulting in changes to the route of the line from the west to the east side of the river, building it to the <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> (4 ft 8½in (1,435mm)), and running from Conwy only as far as Llanrwst. Construction started on 27 August 1860, and the railway was opened on 17 June 1863. An extension of the line to Betws-y-Coed was completed in 1868, but by this time Sharpe and his family had moved to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>.

In 1860 a horse-drawn tramway had been built by Charles Burn, an Englishman, in Switzerland between Geneva and <a href="Carouge">Carouge</a>, a distance of about . This proved to be a success, and Burn planned to build more lines. In 1863 he was joined by Sharpe as a partner, but after a short time of working together the partnership was dissolved, and Sharpe continued with the project alone. By March 1864 a line from the centre of Geneva to <a href="Ch%C3%AAne-Bougeries">Chêne-Bougeries</a>, a distance of about was under construction, to an innovative design. The line to Carouge had two grooved rails. Sharpe's line had two flat rails, with a third grooved rail between them, along which ran a wheel allowing the tram to be steered. The wheel could also be raised to permit the tram to deviate from the track to pass around obstacles, or come to the pavement. This line was Sharpe's sole venture in Switzerland.

In August 1863 Sharpe was granted the concession for building a railway line in southern France from <a href="Perpignan">Perpignan</a> to <a href="Prades%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales">Prades</a> in the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, a distance of . Work on the line began in 1865, but proceeded very slowly; progress was blocked by local landowners, legal processes, and financial problems. Sharpe was managing the project largely from Paris, through a series of agents. By the latter part of 1864 the stress was adversely affecting his health, so in 1865 he spent some time in Italy to recuperate. Following his return the difficulties continued to mount, and in 1867 he renounced his concession. The line was eventually taken over by the State, and was not fully completed until about 1877. At some point Sharpe bought property and iron ore mines along the route of the line.

Concurrently with designing churches and building railways, Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering <a href="Sanitation">sanitary</a> reform. By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission. He was also a visitor to the <a href="National%20school%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">national schools</a>, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a "<a href="chief%20magistrate">chief magistrate</a>". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor housing, open sewers, overflowing <a href="cesspit">cesspit</a>s, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by <a href="Infiltration/Inflow">infiltration</a>. Many people suffered from <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including "cleansing, lighting and watching" the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers. The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first <a href="Local%20board%20of%20health">Lancaster Board of Health</a>.

Before, during and after his mayoralty, Sharpe played a major role in promoting sanitary reform, often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical, political and persuasive skills to the full. A campaign to deal with the problems had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors, Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de Vitre. Sharpe joined them, drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied <a href="Richard%20Owen">Professor Richard Owen</a> (born and educated in Lancaster) on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844. In 1848 Robert Rawlinson, also from Lancaster, was appointed as local surveyor, and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks. Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report, he was not satisfied with its details. Later that year, which was during his mayoralty, he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the <a href="Local%20board%20of%20health%23General%20Board%20of%20Health">General Board of Health</a>, including its chairman, <a href="George%20Howard%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle">Lord Morpeth</a>, and its secretary <a href="Edwin%20Chadwick">Edwin Chadwick</a>. As a result of this meeting, the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector, and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster's problems. Smith's investigation took place in January 1849, and his report was received in July. In his conclusions, Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants, and that this could be achieved by "a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water, and ... a thorough system of drainage and sewerage". Subsequently, an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out, and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed. Delays, disputes and controversies continued, until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855, when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way. This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously. Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s visit to Lancaster in October 1851, and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion. He also took part in the proceedings on the day, escorting the Queen, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, and the Prince of Wales (the future <a href="Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a>) to the top of the castle tower.

In 1859 Sharpe was appointed as a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> for Lancashire and for <a href="Denbighshire%20%28historic%29">Denbighshire</a>. Shortly after his return to Lancaster in 1866 he again became involved in local politics. In 1867 the <a href="Lancaster%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">constituency of Lancaster</a> was <a href="Disfranchisement">disfranchised</a> because of corruption, and so lost its two members of parliament. Sharpe wrote a long letter to <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> (<a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, and responsible for the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act</a> of that year), arguing the case for reinstating Lancaster as a <a href="Electoral%20district">parliamentary constituency</a>, and putting forward his own proposals for electoral reform. His letter received no reply, and Lancaster remained without parliamentary representation for the next 20 years.

On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Bolton">Bolton Parish Church</a>. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and <a href="Alfred%20Sharpe">Alfred</a> in 1853.

When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a "Memoir" published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as "perhaps the happiest years of his life". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called "Bron Haul" near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the <a href="A5%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A5 road</a>. Two years later he bought a larger property called "Coed-y-Celyn" on the east bank of the <a href="River%20Lledr">River Lledr</a>, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called "Richemont" on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.

Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery. "Glowing obituaries" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including "The Builder", "The Building News", and "The Architect". His <a href="Estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> was valued at "under £14,000" (equivalent to £ as of ). A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul's, next to that of his wife.

Throughout his life, Sharpe took an interest in sport, as an active participant and as an organiser. At Cambridge, he was a member of the <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Boat%20Club">Lady Margaret Boat Club</a>, and <a href="Coxswain%20%28rowing%29">coxed</a> the college boat. Back in Lancaster, he took up archery, joined the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, played cricket and coxed. In June 1841 he helped to found the Lancaster Lunesdale Cricket Club and the <a href="Lancaster%20Rowing%20Club">Lancaster Rowing Club</a>. Sharpe was also an accomplished musician, and a member of the committee that organised the Lancaster Choral Society's first concert in September 1836. The society thrived for a number of years, and for a time Sharpe was its conductor. By the beginning of 1837 he was a member of the Lancaster Literary, Scientific, and Natural History Society, giving a number of talks to the society, and eventually becoming a committee member. That same year he became the secretary and treasurer of the Lancaster Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, and in April 1840 he joined the committee of Lancaster's Protestant Association. In 1842 he was part of a committee promoting congregational singing, and he gave an illustrated series of lectures on its history and merits. His love of music continued throughout his life, and included training choirs, composing hymn tunes, and manufacturing musical instruments similar to small <a href="Pump%20organ">harmonium</a>s.

In early 1843 Sharpe bought Lancaster's Theatre Royal (now the <a href="Grand%20Theatre%2C%20Lancaster">Grand Theatre</a>), the third-oldest extant provincial theatre in Britain, which had opened in 1782. He spent £680 (equivalent to £ as of ) on converting it into the Music Hall and Museum. It was the only place in Lancaster, other than the churches, able to accommodate 400 or more people, and so was used for a variety of purposes, including concerts, lectures, and religious meetings. In 1848 Sharpe founded the Lancaster Athenaeum, a private society for "the promotion of public entertainment and instruction", to which end it organised lectures on literary and scientific subjects, concerts and exhibitions. It held its meetings in the Music Hall, which was at one period renamed the Athenaeum. In 1852 Sharpe became the proprietor of the Phoenix Foundry on Germany Street, which among other things supplied <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> pipes for the Lancaster waterworks, sewers and drains, and shells for the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>.

Hughes considers that Sharpe was never in the "first division" of 19th-century church architects; his designs were "basic, workmanlike, and occasionally imaginative, though hardly inspiring". There is no such thing as a "typical" church designed by Sharpe. He was an innovator and experimenter, and throughout his life a student of architecture. The architectural styles he used started with the Romanesque, passed through "pre-archaeological" Gothic to "correct" Gothic, and then back to Romanesque for his last church. The sizes of the churches varied, from the small simple chapels at Cowgill and Howgill to the large and splendid church of Holy Trinity, Blackburn. During Sharpe's earlier years in practice, between 1838 and 1842, Britain was going through a period of severe <a href="Recession">economic recession</a>, which may have been why he designed many of his churches to be built as cheaply as possible.

As an architectural historian, Hughes considers Sharpe to be "in the top rank". His drawings of authentic Gothic buildings were still in use a century after his death. The architectural historian James Price states that Sharpe was "considered the greatest authority on Cistercian Abbeys in England". Some writers have regarded Sharpe as an early pioneer of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a>, although in Hughes' opinion this is "probably more for his books than for his buildings". In 1897, 20 years after his death, Sharpe was considered to be sufficiently notable to merit an entry in the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>". In the article, the author refers to his being "an enthusiastic and profound student of medieval architecture". As a railway engineer he was "hardly an unqualified success"; but his administrative and persuasive skills were considerable, as is shown in his planning of railways in Northwest England, and in the sanitary reform and water supply of Lancaster. As an amateur musician his "gifts were prodigious". Hughes considers that Sharpe "used his talents to the full", and in view of the ways in which he employed his many gifts, Price describes him as Lancaster's "<a href="Polymath">Renaissance man</a>".


A Worts Travelling Bachelorship (now known as a Worts Travelling Scholars Fund) is the result of a bequest by Wiliam Worts, who died in 1709. It makes grants "for the promotion or encouragement of investigations in countries outside Great Britain respecting the religion, learning, law, politics, customs, manner and rarities, natural or artificial, of those countries, or for purposes of geographical discovery or of antiquarian or scientific research in such countries".<br>
A further Commissioners' church was later designed in conjunction with Paley, <a href="St%20Saviour%27s%20Church%2C%20Ringley">St Saviour, Ringley</a> (1850–54).
Holy Trinity is now <a href="redundant%20church">redundant</a> and is in the care of the <a href="Churches%20Conservation%20Trust">Churches Conservation Trust</a>, the only one of Sharpe's churches to be so preserved.
Unfortunately the spire was not as durable as the rest of the church. By 1936 it had become unsafe, and was dismantled. In 1966 the lantern and bell-tower were also demolished.<br>
The tower was not completed until 1850. It was built from terracotta of inferior quality, and was later found to be unsafe, having to be rebuilt in 1912.
The two older boys were educated at <a href="Rossall%20School">Rossall School</a>, and Alfred at <a href="Haileybury%20and%20Imperial%20Service%20College">Haileybury College</a>. Francis became the proprietor of the Phoenix Foundry, while Edmund (junior) joined the textile-coating firm of Storey Brothers, Lancaster, and later became <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">Lord of the Manor</a> of <a href="Halton-with-Aughton">Halton</a>. <a href="Alfred%20Sharpe">Alfred</a> had a career as a big-game hunter in Central Africa, then as a colonial civil servant, being knighted in 1897, and later becoming the first Governor of <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a> (now <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>). The girls did not marry, living together in <a href="Ambleside">Ambleside</a> and later moving back to Lancaster.
An example of this is given in , which states "Mr Sharpe (d. 1877) was one of the earliest, ablest and most zealous pioneers of the English Gothic revival".

Emery Molyneux ( ; died June 1598) was an English <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> maker of <a href="globe">globe</a>s, mathematical instruments and <a href="weapon">ordnance</a>. His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in England and the first to be made by an Englishman.

Molyneux was known as a <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and maker of <a href="mathematical%20instruments">mathematical instruments</a> such as <a href="compass">compass</a>es and <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a>es. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer <a href="Richard%20Hakluyt">Richard Hakluyt</a> and the mathematicians <a href="Robert%20Hues">Robert Hues</a> and <a href="Edward%20Wright%20%28mathematician%29">Edward Wright</a>. He also knew the explorers <a href="Thomas%20Cavendish">Thomas Cavendish</a>, <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>, <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a> and <a href="John%20Davis%20%28English%20explorer%29">John Davis</a>. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.

Molyneux emigrated to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> with his wife in 1596 or 1597. He succeeded in interesting the <a href="States-General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States-General</a>, the parliament of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces</a>, in a cannon he had invented, but he died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him.

Only six of his globes are believed still to be in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe is owned by <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a> and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at <a href="Petworth%20House">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth">Petworth</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>.

Emery Molyneux is regarded as the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England and as the first English globe-maker. Little is known about the man himself. <a href="Petruccio%20Ubaldini">Petruccio Ubaldini</a>, an Italian <a href="calligraphy">calligraphist</a>, <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminator</a> and <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a> who was acquainted with him, said he was "of obscure and humble family background". It seems likely that he was the "Emery Molynox" who was presented to the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Stationers%20and%20Newspaper%20Makers">Worshipful Company of Stationers</a> as the apprentice of one William Cooke in October 1557. By the 1580s he had a workshop in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, on the south bank of the Thames, and enjoyed a reputation as a <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and maker of mathematical instruments. Richard Polter, in his book "The Pathway to Perfect Sayling" (1605), mentioned that Molyneux had been a skilful maker of <a href="compass">compass</a>es and <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a>es.

Through his trade, Molyneux was known to the explorers <a href="Thomas%20Cavendish">Thomas Cavendish</a>, <a href="John%20Davis%20%28English%20explorer%29">John Davis</a>, <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> and <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>, the writer <a href="Richard%20Hakluyt">Richard Hakluyt</a>, and the mathematicians <a href="Robert%20Hues">Robert Hues</a> and <a href="Edward%20Wright%20%28mathematician%29">Edward Wright</a>. The construction of globes by Molyneux appears to have been suggested by Davis to his <a href="patronage">patron</a> William Sanderson, a London merchant who has been described as "one of the most munificent and patriotic of merchant-princes of London in the days of Elizabeth I". Sanderson readily agreed to bear the manufacturing costs, and financed initial production of the globes with a capital investment of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>1,000 (almost £160,000 as of 2007).

In making his <a href="terrestrial%20globes">terrestrial globes</a>, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He is known to have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to <a href="Thomas%20Harriot">Thomas Harriot</a> in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh came by the information from <a href="Pedro%20Sarmiento%20de%20Gamboa">Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa</a>, a <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galician</a> explorer sent by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">King Philip II of Spain</a> to fortify the <a href="Strait%20of%20Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a> after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.

Molyneux accompanied <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> on his 1577–1580 <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigation</a> of the world; as Ubaldini reported, "[h]e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake". A legend in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> on the terrestrial globe, explaining why Molyneux had left out the <a href="Polar%20region">polar lands</a> and corrected the distance across the Atlantic Ocean between <a href="The%20Lizard">The Lizard</a> and <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a> in <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, concluded:

On the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made. They are mentioned in a description of Molyneux's globes in "Blundeville His Exercises" (1594) by <a href="Thomas%20Blundeville">Thomas Blundeville</a>, a country gentleman who was an enthusiastic student of astronomy and navigation. Thomas Cavendish appears to have helped Molyneux with his globes, and it is possible that Molyneux accompanied him on his 1587 voyage around the world, which returned to England on 9 September 1588. In 1889, Sir <a href="Clements%20Markham">Clements Markham</a>, an English explorer, author and geographer, pointed out that a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> legend on the terrestrial globe, placed off the <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>n coast, states: "Thomas Caundish "18 Dec. 1587 hæc terra" sub nostris oculis "primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris Incolæ maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis"". However, <a href="Helen%20Wallis">Helen Wallis</a>, former Map Curator of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, observed in 1951 that this was unlikely, because Molyneux incorrectly plotted Cavendish's course in <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a>. She suggested, however, that another legend on the globe may indicate that he sailed on at least one if not all of John Davis's voyages.

The mathematician and <a href="cartography">cartographer</a> Edward Wright assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin. On 10 April 1591, the <a href="astrologer">astrologer</a> and physician <a href="Simon%20Forman">Simon Forman</a> visited Molyneux's workshop and taught him how to find <a href="longitude">longitude</a>. It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript <a href="gore%20%28segment%29">gores</a> (the flat map segments attached to the globes), he had them printed by the celebrated <a href="Flanders">Flemish</a> engraver and cartographer <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>, who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be deduced from the phrase ""Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592"" that appears on the celestial globe along with Sanderson's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is recorded on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase ""Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi— / Sandersoni Londinē: / sis descripsit"" ("Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this").

Molyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of <a href="Gerardus%20Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a>'s globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by <a href="Gemma%20Frisius">Gemma Frisius</a> that Mercator had helped to construct. To the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the <a href="Crux">Southern Cross</a> and <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Southern Triangle</a>, though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been <a href="Andrea%20Corsali">Andrea Corsali</a>'s diagram of the <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> sky published in 1550.

Molyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's <a href="molding%20%28process%29">moulding</a> or <a href="casting">casting</a> process was "the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme ... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes ... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme".

In 1589, Richard Hakluyt announced the forthcoming publication of Molyneux's terrestrial globe at the end of the preface to "The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation". Referring to the map that was inserted into the volume—a reproduction of the ""Typus Orbis Terrarum"" engraved by Franciscus Hogenberg for <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a>' "<a href="Theatrum%20Orbis%20Terrarum">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</a>" (1570)—he wrote:

Ubaldini reported Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan. He was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> globes to Elizabeth I at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> in July 1591. Ubaldini noted that "he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces". According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at in diameter were then the largest ever made, were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593. Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in <a href="Newington%20Butts">Newington Butts</a> to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: "The whole earth, a present for a Prince ..."; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: "Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other." Elizabeth I saw globes and <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a>s as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth. The <a href="royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23History">royal coat of arms</a> contained in Elizabeth I Privy Seal was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe.

Several treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides on their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled "The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano", which Sanderson published in 1592. In the same year, <a href="Thomas%20Hood%20%28mathematician%29">Thomas Hood</a>, a London-based mathematics lecturer who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes, published "The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall". This was followed in 1594 by two works, one of which was Blundeville's book. The other, "Tractatus de Globis et Eorum Usu" ("Treatise on Globes and their Use"), was published by the mathematician Robert Hues. This work went into at least 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch, English and French. In 1599, Edward Wright published "Certaine Errors in Navigation", which included commentary on the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes developed by Molyneux.

According to Markham, "the appearance of the globes naturally created a great sensation, and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator." The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to £20 each: these were purchased by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions. Among the purchasers were <a href="Thomas%20Bodley">Thomas Bodley</a> and the Warden of <a href="All%20Souls%20College%2C%20Oxford">All Souls College</a>, for their libraries in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. William Sanderson presented the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Universities of Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> with a pair each. The public preacher Thomas Laughton made an inaugural gift of a Molyneux globe to the <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a> library. Smaller globes were also made, though no examples have survived. Sanderson is known to have presented one of these to <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil</a> in 1595, together with Hues' "Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes". Intended as practical navigation aids, they cost as little as £2.

The globes provided navigators and students with methods for finding the place of the sun, <a href="latitude">latitude</a>, course, distance, amplitudes, <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a>s, time and <a href="declination">declination</a>. They proved such a boon to navigation that they came into widespread use on ships. In the dedication of his 1595 book "The Seamans Secrets" to the <a href="Admiralty">Lord High Admiral</a>, <a href="Charles%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Nottingham">Charles Howard, the 1st Earl of Nottingham</a>, navigator John Davis spoke of "the mechanical practices drawn from the Arts of Mathematick, [in which] our Country doth yield men of principal excellency", and he noted "Mr Emery Mullenenx for the exquisite making of Globes bodies".

In the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a <a href="cannon">cannon</a>, which he described as his "new invention, of <a href="lead%20shot">shot</a> and <a href="artillery">artillery</a>, to be used principally in <a href="naval%20warfare">naval warfare</a>: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand <a href="musket">musket</a> shot; with wildfire not to be quenched". In March 1593, Molyneux was issued with a <a href="Royal%20warrant%20%28document%29">royal warrant</a>. Two years later, the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, <a href="potassium%20nitrate">saltpetre</a>, <a href="pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a>, oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. On 4 November 1596 the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> urged the <a href="Admiralty">Lord Admiral</a> "to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines" as part of measures to defend England's south coast. It appears the request was ignored. On 27 September 1594, the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of £200 and an <a href="annuity%20%28financial%20contracts%29">annuity</a> of £50. He chose to surrender the latter when, some time between March or April 1596 and 4 June 1597, he and his wife Anne emigrated to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="Holland">Holland</a>. Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593.

Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making. However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On 26 January 1598, the <a href="States-General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States-General</a>, the parliament of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces</a>, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On 6 June he lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards. His wife was granted <a href="administrator%20of%20an%20estate">administration</a> of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate <a href="pension">pension</a> of 50 <a href="Dutch%20guilder">florins</a> on 9 April 1599. Molyneux apparently had no other surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him. No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by <a href="Robert%20Morden">Robert Morden</a> and William Berry, and by <a href="Joseph%20Moxon">Joseph Moxon</a>. However, over 40 years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were "yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)".

In the second volume of the greatly expanded version of his book "The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation" (1599), Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright–Molyneux Map. Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it was the first map to use Wright's improvements on <a href="Mercator%20projection">Mercator's projection</a>.

Having, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' "Tractatus de Globis". On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown by a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.

In his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements made by Hondius the Elder to Molyneux's globe. It is believed that the Hondius globes also spurred <a href="Willem%20Blaeu">Willem Blaeu</a> to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore may have indirectly influenced the evolution of Dutch globe-making.

The appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Comedy%20of%20Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>", written between 1592 and 1594, one of the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>s, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: "No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her." The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself. <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> <a href="dramatist">dramatist</a> <a href="Thomas%20Dekker%20%28poet%29">Thomas Dekker</a> wrote in one of his plays published in "The Gull's Horn-book" (1609):

It has been suggested that the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%27s%20Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>, the <a href="playing%20company">playing company</a> that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space the <a href="Globe%20Theatre">Globe Theatre</a>, built in 1599, as a response to the growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes stimulated by those of Molyneux.

In "<a href="Twelfth%20Night">Twelfth Night</a>" (1600–1601), Shakespeare alluded to the Wright–Molyneux Map when Maria says of <a href="Malvolio">Malvolio</a>: "He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies."

Only six Molyneux globes are known to exist today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in <a href="Zerbst">Zerbst</a>, <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> (at the <a href="Germanisches%20Nationalmuseum">Germanisches Nationalmuseum</a> (German National Museum)) and <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a> (<a href="Hessisches%20Landesmuseum">Hessisches Landesmuseum</a> (<a href="Hesse">Hesse</a> Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it is believed to have been destroyed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a> in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at <a href="Petworth%20House">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth">Petworth</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>.

A terrestrial globe was discovered in <a href="Baron%20Leconfield">Lord Leconfield</a>'s library at <a href="Petworth%20House">Petworth House</a> in <a href="Petworth">Petworth</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>, in July 1949. According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>, the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh, who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. Northumberland, known as the "Wizard Earl" for his interest in scientific and <a href="alchemy">alchemical</a> experiments and his library, was suspected of being involved in the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605 because his relative <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28plotter%29">Thomas Percy</a> was among the conspirators. <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> imprisoned Raleigh in the Tower for his supposed involvement in the <a href="Main%20Plot">Main Plot</a>. Although the theory is supported by <a href="circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial evidence</a>, a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe may have belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's. The globe, however, almost certainly spent many years in the Tower before its transfer to Petworth House, where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.

The Petworth House globe, now in the North Gallery, is the only Molyneux terrestrial globe preserved in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's "great globes", measuring in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> the previous year. The <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places, to the extent that it was hard to read. Parts of it, and large sections of the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a>, are missing altogether. The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of <a href="plaster">plaster</a> about ⁄ inch (3 mm) thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass <a href="Meridian%20%28geography%29">meridian</a> ring, but its hour circle and index are missing. Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997. The globe was exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> in 1951 and 1952.

A bill in the accounts of 11 April 1717 for "repairing the globes in the library" is the earliest reference to the <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a>'s ownership of the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes. Markham's view was that <a href="Robert%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Robert Ashley</a> (1565–1641), a <a href="barristers%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">barrister</a> of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent <a href="geographer">geographer</a>, was likely to have left the globes to the <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inn</a> in his will, together with his books. Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library and included copies of the second edition of Hues' "Tractatus de Globis" and other works on <a href="cosmography">cosmography</a>. On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not mentioned in the will. She believes that they were probably acquired by Middle Temple on their publication in 1603.

The celestial globe is dated 1592, but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603 and is the only example of its kind. Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 for a purchaser in England, perhaps the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates redated to 1603. The Middle Temple terrestrial globe differs from the Petworth House globe of 1592 by incorporating Raleigh's discoveries in <a href="Guyanas">Guiana</a> and adding new place-names in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and Africa, as well as an island marked "<a href="Korea">Corea</a>" off the coast of China. The most extensive revision altered the <a href="Northeast%20Passage">Northeast Passage</a> to take account of discoveries made on <a href="Willem%20Barentsz">Willem Barentsz</a>'s third voyage to <a href="Novaya%20Zemlya">Novaya Zemlya</a> in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, because no discoveries after that year are included. It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was the most likely source. Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily <a href="varnish">varnish</a>ed. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton; they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work in 1930.

At the start of World War II, the globes were sent to <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a> and stored with part of the <a href="Wallace%20Collection">Wallace Collection</a> at Hall Barn in the care of <a href="Baron%20Burnham">Lady Burnham</a>. They were brought back to London in 1945 and were at one stage kept in the <a href="King%27s%20Library">King's Library</a> on loan to the British Museum. The globes were installed in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958. In 2003, they were loaned to the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.

In 2004, Middle Temple proposed selling the Molyneux globes, valued at over £1 million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.

The Middle Temple's Molyneux globes are the subject of a book-length project, "The Molyneux Globes: Mathematical Practice and Theory", by Dr. Lesley B. Cormack, Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classics of the Faculty of Arts, <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>. The project examines the community of mathematicians, <a href="Natural%20philosophy">natural philosophers</a>, instrument-makers, and gentlemen-virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes, particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community.

The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">William IV</a> (William the Wise), the <a href="Landgrave">Landgrave</a> of <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Hesse-Kassel</a> (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of <a href="astronomy">astronomical</a> research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, <a href="Maurice%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Maurice</a>, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.

D-Day naval deceptions

Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were tactical <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a>s conducted on 6 June 1944 in support of the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Allied landings in Normandy</a>. The operations formed the naval component of <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a>, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion.

Small boats, along with aircraft from <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>, simulated invasion fleets approaching <a href="La%20Poterie-Cap-d%27Antifer">Cap d'Antifer</a>, <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> and <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try to confuse German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented <a href="Operation%20Titanic">Operation Titanic</a>, which was intended to confuse the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.

It is unclear whether the operations were successful, due to the complexity of their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.

Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II deception operations. They were conducted as part of <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a>, a broad strategic <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a> intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a> (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">First United States Army Group</a> (FUSAG) represented the bulk of the Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through <a href="Operation%20Fortitude">Operation Fortitude South</a>.
The Allied story for FUSAG was that the army group, based in south-east <a href="England">England</a>, would invade the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. In reality, the main invasion force would land in Normandy on <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a>. As D-Day approached, the LCS moved on to planning tactical deceptions to help cover the progress of the real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions. The latter would come into effect once landings were made but the former (involving naval, air and special forces units) were used to cover the approach of the true invasion fleet.

In preparation for the coming landings, Allied scientists had worked on techniques for obscuring the size and disposition of an invasion force. The German defences relied on the <a href="Seetakt%20radar">Seetakt radar</a> system. Scientists from the <a href="Telecommunications%20Research%20Establishment">Telecommunications Research Establishment</a> discovered that the resolution of the Seetakt was about . To deceive the radar system they proposed dropping clouds of aluminium foil (<a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a>, then code-named Window) at two mile intervals. The clouds would appear as a continuous blip, similar to one created by an approaching fleet, on German screens. The Allies also repurposed radio equipment, code named Moonshine, to jam the Seetakt signal. Allied command decided that, rather than mask the approaching fleet, these measures would serve to alert German defences. So it was decided to combine these techniques with small groups of boats to simulate an entire invasion fleet aimed at the Calais region.

Allied planners proposed that small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast under a cloud of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide the small size of the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.

Glimmer and Taxable were very similar operations. They were executed in the early hours of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching <a href="Cap%20d%27Antifer">Cap d'Antifer</a> and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed <a href="Corner%20reflector">radar reflector</a> balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.

The operations required precise flying in elongated circuits with replacement aircraft having to merge in seamlessly to avoid tell-tale gaps. The bombers were staged at intervals parallel to the French coast. Once in position they would spend two and a half minutes flying toward the coast, dropping chaff at fifteen-second intervals. Then the aircraft would turn and head away from the coast for two minutes and ten seconds. By repeating this circuit, the wide cloud of chaff edged toward the coast just like a real sea-borne fleet. The aircraft had to be modified by cutting a hole in the nose to allow the large quantities of chaff to be dropped.
The larger of the two operations, Taxable, was carried out by 18 small boats, a mix of <a href="Harbour%20Defence%20Motor%20Launch">Harbour Defence Motor Launch</a>es (HDML) and <a href="RAF%20Marine%20Branch">RAF Pinnaces</a>, designated Special Task Force A. Chaff was dropped by <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Lancaster bombers</a> from the <a href="No.%20617%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 617 "Dam Busters" Squadron</a>. Each aircraft carried an expanded crew of up to 14. The squadron began training for the operation on 7 May, but were not aware of their final target.

Task Force A left port in the evening of 5 June, but struggled in bad seas which affected their equipment and ability to converge at their meeting point. By 00:37 on 6 June the lead boats were on schedule and had reached the muster point. Between 02:00 and 04:00 the ships operated radar and radio equipment as they headed toward a point offshore. From there the task force simulated a landing attempt; by running fast to within of the beach before returning to the 7-mile marker under cover of smoke. During this time only a small German response was observed including searchlights and intermittent gunfire. Shortly after 05:00 the operation ended and the task force laid mines before heading toward <a href="Newhaven%2C%20East%20Sussex">Newhaven</a>, reaching port by midday.

The air operations for Glimmer were conducted by <a href="No.%20218%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 218 "Gold Coast" Squadron</a> under <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> R. M. Fenwick-Wilson. The squadron flew six <a href="Short%20Stirling">Short Stirling</a> bombers on the operation, with two additional airborne reserve aircraft. Each aircraft carried two pilots who rotated flying duties. The naval contingent, Special Task Force B under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> W. M. Rankin, consisted of 12 HDMLs equipped with jamming gear, radios and radar-reflecting balloons. The task force began jamming operations at approximately 01:00 followed by radio chatter around an hour later.

Glimmer elicited more response from German forces than Taxable including <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> planes sent to investigate the "fleet". After completing their assignment (which, unlike Taxable, did not include laying mines) the ships returned to port, reaching their berths by 13:00 on D-Day.

Big Drum was similar to the other D-Day naval deceptions, but without an airborne component. Task Force C consisted of four HDMLs, whose job was to operate as a distraction on the western flank of the invasion. The plan originally called for the task force, which was attached to Force U (the westernmost convoy of the invasion fleet), to operate radar jamming equipment as it approached the French coast, holding off shore until first light. After the Germans failed to respond, the ships moved to within of the coast. No response, either in the air or on the shore, was observed, and the convoy returned safely to Newhaven.

Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were complicated in execution, requiring coordination of air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable did not appear to have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.

From intelligence intercepts it appears that German forces in the Pas de Calais region reported an invasion fleet. In addition, there are reports of the decoys being fired on by shore batteries in that area. In an 11 June report on the operations, Lieutenant Commander Ian Cox (who was in charge of deception units) indicated that German forces had been convinced by the fake radio traffic. Intercepted dispatches from <a href="Hiroshi%20%C5%8Cshima">Hiroshi Ōshima</a>, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, made reference to the naval deceptions. An 8 June dispatch referred to the Calais region and stated "an enemy squadron that had been operating there has now withdrawn".

Although disappointed not to have seen any action during the night of D-Day, and still unsure of their actual impact, the bomber crews felt proud of the operations. <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> <a href="Les%20Munro">Les Munro</a> of No. 617 Squadron wrote, "I have always considered the operation in one sense to be the most important the squadron carried out in my time – not because [of] bad weather, nor because of any threat of enemy action and not measured by any visible results, but because of the very exacting requirements to which we had to fly and navigate".

<doc id="15452499" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15452499" title="David Suzuki: The Autobiography">
David Suzuki: The Autobiography

David Suzuki: The Autobiography is the 2006 <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> of Canadian science writer and broadcaster <a href="David%20Suzuki">David Suzuki</a>. The book focuses mostly on his life since the 1987 publication of his first autobiography, "Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life". It begins with a chronological account of his childhood, academic years, and broadcasting career. In later chapters, Suzuki adopts a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> style, writing about themes such as his relationship with Australia, his experiences in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, the founding of the <a href="David%20Suzuki%20Foundation">David Suzuki Foundation</a>, and his thoughts on climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. Throughout, Suzuki highlights the continuing impact of events from his childhood.

This is Suzuki's forty-third book and, he says, his last. Critics have called the book candid, sincere, and charming, with insightful commentary if occasionally flat stories. Suzuki's scientific background is reflected in the writing's rational and analytic style.

Suzuki's autobiography spent four weeks at 1 on the "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" list of non-fiction best-sellers and six weeks at No. 6 on the "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">Globe and Mail's</a>" list. The book won two awards in 2007: the Canadian Booksellers' Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year and the <a href="Bill%20Duthie%20Booksellers%27%20Choice%20Award">British Columbia Booksellers' Choice Award</a>. The publishers, Greystone Books and <a href="Douglas%20%26amp%3B%20McIntyre">Douglas & McIntyre</a>, won the CBA Libris Award for Marketing Achievement of the Year.

<a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>-based David Suzuki, 70 years old at the time of this book's publication, is best known as an <a href="Environmentalism">environmental activist</a> and host of the television show "<a href="The%20Nature%20of%20Things">The Nature of Things</a>". He has also worked as a <a href="geneticist">geneticist</a>, <a href="nature%20writer">nature writer</a>, and university professor. His previous book, written in 2002, was "Good News for a Change." His 1987 book, "Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life", unintentionally became his first autobiography. "Metamorphosis" was originally drafted as a collection of essays, but following the prompting of his publisher, Suzuki rewrote it in a more autobiographical style.

Suzuki's working title for this second autobiography was "The Outsider", a title intended to express the author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a <a href="Japanese%20Canadian%20internment">Japanese Canadian internment</a> camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a <a href="Sansei">third generation</a> Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, as one of their own, leading to the simple "The Autobiography" title.

Suzuki's objective in writing the book was to document his experiences of personal rewards gained from the <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a> and to illustrate, specifically for young people, opportunities in environmentalism. Suzuki believes that he has been unfairly labelled as "the master of doom and gloom" by conservative media outlets and that this book will help balance that view. He intends this autobiography to be his final book. Following its publication he planned to reduce his work week from seven to four days to spend more time with family and personal pursuits.
The book has eighteen chapters with a two-page preface, which explains his experience with "Metamorphosis" and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: "the importance of childhood's formative years for the development of the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in <a href="Japanese%20Canadian%20internment">BC's internment camps</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, that still haunt him." In an interview, Suzuki said, "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians that my family and I had not deserved to be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: "There's no disgrace in losing ... The important thing is trying." Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an "outsider" platform.

Suzuki recounts his youth and academic years as a student, professor, and genetics researcher. On his broadcasting career, Suzuki recalls early interviews that demonstrated an affinity for public speaking and the jobs that allowed him to travel the world. Regarding his personal life, he describes his relationships with his five children and the development of his two marriages. In a review in the "<a href="New%20Zealand%20Listener">New Zealand Listener</a>," David Larsen observes: "Step by step, you see him thinking his way into full-fledged environmentalism: not because he's a natural zealot, but because he's an intellectually honest man brought face to face with evidence that our current economic and energy policies are digging our grandchildren's graves."

Later chapters tell of events since "Metamorphosis." In British Columbia, Suzuki spends time on the <a href="Queen%20Charlotte%20Islands">Queen Charlotte Islands</a> and in <a href="Stein%20Valley%20Nlaka%27pamux%20Heritage%20Park">Stein Valley</a> advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of "The Nature of Things" in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the <a href="Kayapo%20people">Kayapo people</a>. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon</a>. His tour of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and early years of the <a href="David%20Suzuki%20Foundation">David Suzuki Foundation</a>, a <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a> based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.

Suzuki's tone is relaxed and understated. <a href="Robert%20Wiersema">Robert Wiersema</a> notes that Suzuki's style has "an analytic quality ... probably rooted in his scientific training". Suzuki shows a humble, dry humour and instances of blurting out surprising statements. One reviewer describes the style as a "fusion of by-the-numbers personal narrative and passionate, insightful commentary".

The book begins as a chronological narrative of Suzuki's life with photographs of his family and friends. The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A <a href="Travel%20literature">travelogue</a> of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.

Two weeks before its release on April 22, 2006, an excerpt was printed in the national daily newspaper "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>." <a href="Greystone%20Books">Greystone Books</a>, the Vancouver division of <a href="Douglas%20%26amp%3B%20McIntyre">Douglas & McIntyre</a>, published the book. The book tour included more than 35 stops over two months throughout Canada. Promoted by the publishers as his "final book tour" and labelled by Suzuki as his "thank-you book tour", it began in <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria, British Columbia</a>, and included stops from coast-to-coast, from <a href="Whitehorse%2C%20Yukon">Whitehorse, Yukon</a>, to <a href="New%20Glasgow%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">New Glasgow, Nova Scotia</a>. Attended by nearly 500 people at each event, a multimedia slideshow with personal photos and videos was presented by Suzuki. The publishers estimated that Suzuki signed 5000 books and conducted 137 media interviews. For their efforts Douglas & McIntyre and Greystone Books were awarded the 2007 Canadian Booksellers Association's Libris Award for Marketing Achievement of the Year. In July, the book was published by <a href="Allen%20%26amp%3B%20Unwin">Allen & Unwin</a> in Australia. Suzuki conducted a promotional tour of both Australia and New Zealand in October and November. The same publishers released paperback editions in April 2007.

"The Autobiography" was No. 1 on "Maclean's" list of nonfiction bestsellers in Canada for four weeks and spent fifteen weeks in the top ten. The book was on "The Globe and Mail's" non-fiction bestsellers' list for five weeks and peaked at No. 6. The book won the 2007 Canadian Booksellers Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year and the 2007 <a href="Bill%20Duthie%20Booksellers%27%20Choice%20Award">British Columbia Booksellers' Choice Award</a>.

Critics variously described his writing as "forthright," "chatty", and "charming". In a review in "The Globe and Mail" <a href="Brian%20Brett">Brian Brett</a> admires "Suzuki's disarming candour" and labels it "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, he calls it "clunkily written" and sometimes repetitive. The "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>" review notes that Suzuki could "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but that many of his stories fall flat. The review in the "<a href="Quill%20%26amp%3B%20Quire">Quill & Quire</a>" notes Suzuki "has not written an indulgent autobiography" and that he "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for "<a href="The%20Vancouver%20Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a>", <a href="Robert%20Wiersema">Robert Wiersema</a> states that while "his life is an open book ... [y]ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." Wiersema calls him "a natural storyteller". The "New Zealand Listener" review states, "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date ... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.

A number of reviewers compared this book with the earlier one, "Metamorphosis". The "Edmonton Journal" considers "David Suzuki: The Autobiography" to be more candid and insightful than the previous book. On the other hand, <a href="Peter%20Desbarats">Peter Desbarats</a>, writing in <a href="Literary%20Review%20of%20Canada">Literary Review of Canada</a>, suggests that "Metamorphosis" had more personal charm. Desbarats is disappointed that "The Autobiography" does not provide a better reflection on the themes of "Metamorphosis." He points out that the best parts, Suzuki's early years, are condensed from one third of "Metamorphosis" to a single chapter in "The Autobiography." Desbarats states that neither book ends with a "satisfying final word" and concludes that Suzuki "is his own worst and most frustrating biographer".

Roxy Ann Peak

Roxy Ann Peak is a mountain in the <a href="Western%20Cascade%20Range">Western Cascade Range</a> at the eastern edge of <a href="Medford%2C%20Oregon">Medford, Oregon</a>. Composed of several <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest">geologic layers</a>, the majority of the peak is of <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> origin and dates to the early <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> epoch. It is primarily covered by <a href="oak%20savanna">oak savanna</a> and open <a href="grassland">grassland</a> on its lower slopes, and <a href="mixed%20coniferous%20forest">mixed coniferous forest</a> on its upper slopes and summit, although not all the way. Despite the peak's relatively small <a href="topographic%20prominence">topographic prominence</a> of , it rises above Medford and is visible from most of the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a>. The mountain is Medford's most important <a href="viewshed">viewshed</a>, <a href="open%20space%20reserve">open space reserve</a>, and recreational resource.

The area was originally inhabited beginning 8,000 to 10,000 years ago by <a href="Paleoamericans">ancestral Native Americans</a>. The <a href="Latgawa">Latgawa</a> <a href="Native%20American%20peoples%20of%20Oregon">Native American</a> tribe was present in the early 1850s when the sudden influx of <a href="Oregon%20pioneer%20history">non-indigenous settlers</a> resulted in the <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">Rogue River Wars</a>. After the wars, the Latgawa were forced away from the region onto <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a>. The peak was named in the late 1850s after one of its first landowners, Roxy Ann Bowen.

In 1883, the city of Medford was established to the west of the mountain, and became <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> two years later. After acquiring a large amount of land from the <a href="Lions%20Clubs%20International">Lions Club</a> and the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a> between 1930 and 1933, the city created the Prescott Park in 1937. The park protects much of the upper slopes and summit of the peak and remains largely undeveloped. The peak's southern foothills have some quickly expanding <a href="single-family%20residence">single-family residential</a> <a href="subdivision%20%28land%29">subdivisions</a>.

Roxy Ann Peak is part of the old and deeply eroded <a href="Western%20Cascades">Western Cascades</a>, along with nearby <a href="Pilot%20Rock%20%28Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Pilot Rock</a>, <a href="Grizzly%20Peak%20%28Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Grizzly Peak</a>, and <a href="Baldy%20%28Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Baldy</a>. It is composed of several distinct geologic layers. The oldest layer, the 35 to 50-million-year-old Payne Cliffs Formation, forms the base of the peak and consists of sedimentary <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="shale">shale</a>, and <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a>. Most of the rest of the mountain is made up of 30 to 35-million-year-old volcanic <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, <a href="breccia">breccia</a>s, and <a href="agglomerate">agglomerate</a>s, known as the Roxy Formation. These rocks are some of the oldest in the Cascades. At the summit, younger basalt <a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dikes</a> and <a href="intrusion">intrusion</a>s <a href="K%E2%80%93Ar%20dating">K–Ar dated</a> to 30.82 ± 2 million years ago form a relatively erosion-resistant cap, likely contributing to the peak's isolation and familiar conical shape. Much of the lower slopes of Roxy Ann are covered by a layer of dense, sticky <a href="clay">clay</a>. Due to the clay's low <a href="shear%20strength">shear strength</a>, the soil is prone to <a href="downhill%20creep">creep</a>, <a href="earthflow">earthflow</a>s, and <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. Several large <a href="subdivision%20%28land%29">subdivisions</a> lie on top of these deposits, some of which are up to thick. The upper slopes and peak have shallow dark brown gravelly loam of the McMullin soil series, while deeper gravelly loam soils on lower slopes are assigned to the Tablerock series. The surrounding clays are mapped as Heppsie or Carney series.

The peak stands above sea level with a topographic prominence of , and rises above the surrounding <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a>. The unique rounded top, location, and height of the peak create a landmark distinguishable from as far away as <a href="Shady%20Cove%2C%20Oregon">Shady Cove</a>, to the north, and the <a href="Siskiyou%20Summit">Siskiyou Summit</a>, to the south.

Humans have lived in the vicinity of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-<a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic, most likely living off edible <a href="bulb">bulb</a>s and large mammals such as <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>s and <a href="Bison%20latifrons">giant bison</a>. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the <a href="Latgawa">Latgawa</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribe, who called the peak "Al-wiya". They probably used the mountain for gathering <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s and hunting <a href="black-tailed%20deer">black-tailed deer</a> and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.

The first European Americans to visit the area were a group of <a href="fur%20trade">fur trappers</a> led by <a href="Peter%20Skene%20Ogden">Peter Skene Ogden</a> who traveled north through the Rogue Valley on February 14, 1827. The first non-<a href="indigenous%20people">indigenous</a> settlers arrived a few decades later. The sudden increase in population created conflicts with the Latgawa, which ultimately led to the <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">Rogue River Wars</a> of 1855 and 1856. After the wars, the remaining Latgawa were forced hundreds of miles north to the <a href="Siletz%20Reservation">Siletz Reservation</a> on the central <a href="Oregon%20Coast">Oregon Coast</a>.

Early settlers named the peak Skinner Butte, after <a href="Alonzo%20A.%20Skinner">Alonzo A. Skinner</a>, the Rogue Valley <a href="Indian%20agent">Indian agent</a> between 1851 and 1853. The current name of the mountain originates from one of its first residents, Roxy Ann Bowen. Two couples—Roxy Ann and her husband John McKee and Stephen and Mary Taylor—<a href="Donation%20Land%20Claim%20Act">claimed</a> almost the entire peak in 1853, and by the late 1850s, it came to be known as Roxy Ann Peak.

In October 1883, construction of the <a href="Oregon%20and%20California%20Railroad">Oregon and California Railroad</a> was begun through the center of the Rogue Valley, bypassing <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Oregon">Jacksonville</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a>. The railroad company also constructed a <a href="train%20station">train depot</a> halfway between <a href="Central%20Point%2C%20Oregon">Central Point</a> and <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Oregon">Phoenix</a>, and <a href="plat">plat</a>ted 82 <a href="city%20block">city block</a>s around it. The townsite was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> by firing 38 cannon blasts—<a href="list%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20date%20of%20statehood">one for each U.S. state</a>—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> on February 24, 1885.

Beginning in the early 1900s, the mountain's foothills were predominantly used for <a href="pear">pear</a> orchards and <a href="lignite">lignite</a> mining. Mining ceased at the onset of World War I, and many of the orchards were abandoned during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, but some still remain.

In 1929, the <a href="Lions%20Clubs%20International">Lions Club</a> purchased two sizable portions of land on the peak, and <a href="deed">deed</a>ed to Medford for recreational use the following year. In 1931, the city acquired another via the <a href="Recreation%20and%20Public%20Purposes%20Act">Recreation and Public Purposes Act</a>, and more in 1933. The park was dedicated in 1937 to George J. Prescott, a Lions Club leader and Medford police officer who was killed on duty on March 16, 1933.

Starting in 1933, the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) made the first improvements to Prescott Park, including constructing of trails and a access road (Roxy Ann Road), creating several picnic areas and overlooks, and digging drainage ditches. The CCC stopped work in 1942, soon after the beginning of World War II. Park maintenance ceased due to municipal budget problems, and <a href="Rationing%23United%20States">gasoline rationing</a> caused the number of visitors to drop markedly. By 1956, the CCC's improvements had suffered $110,000 in damage. The trend of disrepair continued for several decades.

During the late 1990s, the park experienced a surge in vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by <a href="off-roading">off-roading</a>, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable because of lack of maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">regraded</a> Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.

At , Prescott Park is Medford's largest park, covering much of the upper slopes and summit of Roxy Ann. It is two and a half times larger than the city's other parks combined.

Prescott Park and Roxy Ann Peak's upper slopes remain relatively undeveloped, being outside of Medford's city limits and <a href="urban%20growth%20boundary">urban growth boundary</a>. The summit of the peak is home to a <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers">radio tower</a> built in 2007; the new tower replaced three of four existing towers. Roxy Ann Peak and nearby Baldy are the only two primary <a href="transmitter%20station">transmitter station</a> sites in the Rogue Valley.

Residential development of the mountain's southern foothills has been on the rise for several years, primarily in the form of <a href="single-family%20residence">single-family residence</a>s. Construction costs have continued to rise as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon House Bill 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new <a href="foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundations</a> to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of <a href="retrofitting">retrofitting</a> an existing structure approached $100,000.

Roxy Ann Peak's southern foothills are also home to the RoxyAnn Winery, a <a href="Rogue%20Valley%20AVA">Rogue Valley AVA</a> winery founded in 2002. On the opposite side of the mountain is the first <a href="bioreactor%20landfill">bioreactor landfill</a> in <a href="Southern%20Oregon">Southern Oregon</a>, the Dry Creek Landfill, which began a program in 2006 to generate power from collected <a href="methane">methane</a>.

On September 21, 2009, a wildfire broke out on Roxy Ann Peak's western slopes and consumed approximately . It left 25,000 residents without electricity, forced the evacuation of over 100 homes, and cost over $1.3 million to fight, but no structures were damaged.

Roxy Ann Peak's high <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> is due to its wide range of elevations and its location between the <a href="Cascades%20%28ecoregion%29">Cascade</a>, <a href="Klamath%20Mountains%20%28ecoregion%29">Klamath</a>, and <a href="Eastern%20Cascades%20Slopes%20and%20Foothills%20%28ecoregion%29">Eastern Cascade</a> ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a>, <a href="oak%20savanna">oak savanna</a>, and open <a href="grassland">grassland</a>. Scattered <a href="Quercus%20kelloggii">California black oak</a>, <a href="Quercus%20garryana">Oregon white oak</a>, and <a href="Arbutus%20menziesii">Pacific madrone</a> trees grow in these areas, as do <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a>ous shrubs such as <a href="Cercocarpus%20betuloides">birchleaf mountain mahogany</a>, <a href="Arctostaphylos%20viscida">sticky whiteleaf manzanita</a>, <a href="Ceanothus%20cuneatus">buckbrush</a>, <a href="Purshia%20tridentata">antelope bitterbrush</a>, and <a href="Toxicodendron%20diversilobum">Pacific poison oak</a>. Common grasses include <a href="Elymus%20glaucus">blue wildrye</a> and <a href="Koeleria%20macrantha">prairie Junegrass</a>. Wildflowers including <a href="Ranunculus">Southern Oregon buttercup</a>, <a href="Achillea%20millefolium">common yarrow</a>, and <a href="Calochortus%20tolmiei">Tolmie star-tulip</a> also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous forest</a>, dominated by <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>, <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="Calocedrus%20decurrens">incense cedar</a>, <a href="Juniperus%20occidentalis">western juniper</a>, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as <a href="Symphoricarpos%20albus">common snowberry</a>, <a href="Garrya%20fremontii">bearbrush</a>, <a href="Arctostaphylos%20patula">greenleaf manzanita</a>, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, <a href="Ceanothus%20integerrimus">deerbrush</a>, and Pacific poison oak make up the <a href="understory">understory</a> of the forest, along with <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous plant</a>s such as <a href="Symphoricarpos%20mollis">creeping snowberry</a> and <a href="Festuca%20idahoensis">Idaho fescue</a>.

The peak is home to many species of birds, including <a href="blue-gray%20gnatcatcher">blue-gray gnatcatcher</a>s, <a href="lazuli%20bunting">lazuli bunting</a>s, <a href="oak%20titmouse">oak titmice</a>, <a href="acorn%20woodpecker">acorn woodpecker</a>s, and <a href="California%20quail">California quail</a> on the lower slopes, and <a href="mountain%20quail">mountain quail</a>, <a href="mountain%20chickadee">mountain chickadee</a>s, and <a href="red-breasted%20nuthatch">red-breasted nuthatch</a>es on the upper slopes. <a href="Wild%20turkey">Wild turkey</a>s and <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a> such as <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's hawk</a>s, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s, <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, and <a href="prairie%20falcon">prairie falcon</a>s are also common. A few species <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> to the peak in the winter, including <a href="ruby-crowned%20kinglet">ruby-crowned kinglet</a>s, <a href="yellow-rumped%20warbler">yellow-rumped warbler</a>s, and <a href="golden-crowned%20sparrow">golden-crowned sparrow</a>s. Mammals that inhabit the mountain include <a href="black-tailed%20deer">black-tailed deer</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, <a href="bear">bear</a>s, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s. A large herd of <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt elk</a> frequent the peak's western foothills. The herd swelled to over 100 individuals in the mid-2000s, causing traffic problems and severe damage to local pear orchards, but shrank to about 40 members by 2009 after an <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> relocation effort. Other common animals on the peak include <a href="Crotalus%20oreganus">western rattlesnakes</a> and <a href="Ixodes%20pacificus">western blacklegged ticks</a>.

Roxy Ann Peak and Prescott Park serve as Medford's most important <a href="viewshed">viewshed</a>, <a href="open%20space%20reserve">open space reserve</a>, and recreational resource. Popular recreational activities on the peak include picnicking and <a href="hiking">hiking</a>, <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a>, and <a href="Equestrianism">horseback riding</a> on the of designated trails in Prescott Park, which range in difficulty from moderate to steep. In August 2013, the city of Medford and the <a href="International%20Mountain%20Bicycling%20Association">International Mountain Bicycling Association</a> released a conceptual plan detailing future improvements to the park's trail system. The plan would add of new multi-use trails throughout the park, improve existing trails and trail signage, and add a new <a href="trailhead">trailhead</a> on the mountain's western slope, at an estimated cost of between $360,000 and $720,000. If approved, construction on the first phase could begin by 2015.

A <a href="Ropes%20course">challenge course</a> opened in Prescott Park in April 2012, operated by the <a href="Tigard%2C%20Oregon">Tigard</a>-based company Synergo. The course has 15 elements—eight <a href="Ropes%20course%23Low%20course">low</a> and seven <a href="Ropes%20course%23High%20course">high</a>—each formed by various combinations of ropes, wires, platforms, ladders, and swings. They range from above the ground.

The peak and park can be accessed via Roxy Ann Road on the southern side of the mountain. There are two gates on the road; the first is near the base of the peak and is opened and closed on a set schedule, and the second is about one mile beyond it at the park boundary, and is closed to all unauthorized motor vehicles. One mile past the second gate, the road splits into a loop around the summit. Tower Road begins on the north side of the loop and ascends to the summit of the peak. The peak offers expansive views of the surrounding landscape, including the Rogue Valley, <a href="Mount%20Ashland">Mount Ashland</a>, <a href="Mount%20McLoughlin">Mount McLoughlin</a>, <a href="Pilot%20Rock%20%28Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Pilot Rock</a>, the <a href="Crater%20Lake">Crater Lake</a> rim, and even <a href="Mount%20Thielsen">Mount Thielsen</a>, to the north, and <a href="Mount%20Shasta">Mount Shasta</a>, to the south.

Literary Hall

Literary Hall is a mid-19th-century brick <a href="library">library</a>, building and museum located in <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney</a>, a city in the U.S. state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. It is located at the intersection of North High Street (<a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2028">West Virginia Route 28</a>) and West Main Street (<a href="U.S.%20Route%2050">U.S. Route 50</a>). Literary Hall was constructed between 1869 and 1870 by the <a href="Romney%20Literary%20Society">Romney Literary Society</a>.

Founded in 1819, the Romney Literary Society was the first <a href="literary%20society">literary organization</a> of its kind in the present-day state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, and one of the first in the United States. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the <a href="Romney%20Classical%20Institute">Romney Classical Institute</a> and its library. The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861.

During the war, the contents of the society's library were plundered by <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Schools%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Blind">West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind</a> in 1870 and in that year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities.

The Romney Literary Society's last meeting was held at Literary Hall in 1886. From that point to 1973 the building was used as a meeting space by the Clinton Lodge of <a href="Masonic%20lodge">Ancient Free and Accepted Masons</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Star">Order of the Eastern Star</a>. In 1973, the building was purchased by prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines, who used it as a law office and museum. From 1937 to the early 1940s the building also housed a community library. Literary Hall was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on May 29, 1979.

Literary Hall is located in the center of downtown <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney, West Virginia</a>, at the intersection of North High Street (<a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2028">West Virginia Route 28</a>) and West Main Street (<a href="U.S.%20Route%2050">U.S. Route 50</a>) on a city lot less than in size. The <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Courthouse%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Hampshire County Courthouse</a> is immediately to its east across North High Street, and the Romney First United Methodist Church is situated immediately to the building's north. The Old National Building is located to the immediate south of Literary Hall across West Main Street. Literary Hall stands at an elevation of above sea level.

The land upon which Literary Hall was established was originally part of the <a href="Northern%20Neck%20Proprietary">Northern Neck Proprietary</a>, a land grant that the exiled <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">English Interregnum</a>. Following the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee <a href="Thomas%20Colepeper%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Colepeper">Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper</a> and <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a> in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a> in 1719.

Literary Hall was built upon a land lot designated "Lot 56" to the immediate west of the public square of Romney. In 1790, the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a <a href="Cadastral%20surveying">cadastral survey map</a> of Romney. Prior to this survey, Lord Fairfax had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of Romney sometime before the town's <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporation</a> on December 23, 1762. On June 30, 1790, Mitchel submitted to the trustees a "Plan of the Town of Romney", which divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size, with four lots adjacent to the <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a> comprising the public square.

The <a href="Romney%20Literary%20Society">Romney Literary Society</a>, which built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870, was organized by nine prominent men in Romney on January 30, 1819. With its establishment in 1819, the Romney Literary Society became the first literary organization of its kind in the present-day state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, and one of the first in the United States. On February 4, 1819, the constitution of the society was adopted, which provided that the organization should be known as the "<a href="Polemic">Polemic</a> Society of Romney". The society founded its library in 1819 with the acquisition of two books, and by 1861 the society's humble library had grown to contain approximately 3,000 volumes, consisting of books on literature, science, history and art.

The Romney Literary Society commenced a movement to establish an institution for "the higher education of the youth of the community". As a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of <a href="Romney%20Academy">Romney Academy</a> in 1820, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle</a>. In 1846, the society constructed a new building to house the <a href="Romney%20Classical%20Institute">Romney Classical Institute</a> and its library, both of which fell under the society's supervision.

The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> in 1861. During the war, many members fought for the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> forces and were killed during the conflict. The contents of the society's library were plundered by <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. Following the war's end, only 400 of those volumes could be recovered, with just 200 remaining on the library's shelves.

The Romney Literary Society reorganized on May 15, 1869. Following the reorganization, the society built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also undertaking an initiative to bring the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Schools%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Blind">West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind</a> to its old Romney Classical Institute campus. The construction of Literary Hall was part of the society's effort to revive the organization and reassemble its original library. The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones, and the library reopened with 700 volumes. For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. As older members died, interest in the society began to dwindle. The society's meetings were held less frequently, and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15, 1886.

The Clinton Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons was the second organization to utilize Literary Hall as a meeting place. The Clinton Lodge was the first Masonic lodge to be chartered in <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a> and is among the earliest Masonic lodges to be established in present-day West Virginia. It was chartered by the <a href="Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Virginia">Grand Lodge of Virginia</a> on December 13, 1825. The lodge underwent four periods of hiatus: first, between 1838 and December 15, 1846; a second time between 1855 and its rechartering on July 3, 1857; a third time between 1861 and December 11, 1867, during the Civil War and <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>; and a fourth time between November 29, 1881 and November 12, 1890, when it was again reactivated.

Following the completion of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized the first floor of the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Star">Order of the Eastern Star</a>, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons to rescue the old building from demolition and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines restored the building to its original state and used it as a law office building and private museum. Haines later relocated his law offices to an adjacent commercial building. Under Haines's ownership, Literary Hall was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on May 29, 1979.

The building again served as a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated to the first floor of Literary Hall from its previous facility in the basement of the Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the <a href="American%20Legion%20Auxiliary">American Legion Auxiliary</a>, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the <a href="National%20Youth%20Administration">National Youth Administration</a> and the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>.

In January 1942, a meeting was held for the purpose of establishing a more extensive library service. Later that month, on January 29, a charter was issued by <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20West%20Virginia">West Virginia Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20Smith%20O%27Brien%20%28Congressman%29">William Smith O'Brien</a> for the creation of the non-profit Hampshire County Library Association. Following its incorporation, the library was relocated from Literary Hall to two rear adjoining rooms on the second story of the Hampshire County Courthouse. The association continued to house its library collection in the courthouse until 1967, when the new Hampshire County Public Library building at 153 West Main Street was formally dedicated on September 28, 1967. The library had been built on land donated by sisters Kate and Mary Davis, who had been engaged in the restoration of Literary Hall and whose father, Charles Maurice Davis, had been a member of both the Romney Literary Society and the Clinton Lodge Masons, which had both held meetings in the building.

The interior and exterior of Literary Hall remain largely intact. At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.

Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as an anomaly because the basic design and <a href="fenestration%20%28architecture%29">fenestration</a> patterns, which invoke early <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federal</a> and <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> design elements, are adorned with details more characteristic of the Victorian era.

According to architectural historian Michael J. Pauley of the West Virginia Department of Culture and History's Historic Preservation Unit, Literary Hall's unique structural features make the building "one of Romney's and Hampshire County's most notable landmarks, and one in which this community is justifiably proud". Pauley further averred that the building is "highly representative of the development of education and literature in the early United States". In describing its impact on Romney's streetscape, Chambers described Literary Hall as "adding distinction to Romney's major street intersection". Chambers also noted the building's resemblance and "strong architectural kinship" to the <a href="Romney%20Presbyterian%20Church">Romney Presbyterian Church</a>.

Literary Hall is a two-story red <a href="brick">brick</a> structure, rectangular in plan, and topped with a <a href="gable">gable</a> roof. The first floor of Literary Hall consists of four rooms, and the second story is a single large <a href="ballroom">ballroom</a>. Fused with symmetrical elements evoking Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles are exterior <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">decorative moldings</a> and brick <a href="corbel">corbel</a>ing in the Victorian style.

The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall is divided into three <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a>, and its west and east elevations are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a <a href="Sash%20window">double-hung sash wooden window</a>, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden <a href="louver">louver</a>ed <a href="window%20shutter">window shutter</a>s. The building's brick is laid in an <a href="Brickwork%23American%2C%20or%20common%20bond">American bond</a> pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.

The main façade is topped by a simple wooden <a href="Cornice%23Rake">raking cornice</a> that surmounts an ornamental corbel brick pendant. A semicircular <a href="fanlight">fanlight</a>, or lunette, is located in the center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.

Each of the main façade's first- and second-story windows and the entrance are adorned with white wooden <a href="Hood%20mould">label moldings</a>. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a> light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick <a href="Stoop%20%28architecture%29">stoop</a> that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps leading up to the stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.

Literary Hall is flanked by two interior side <a href="chimney">chimney</a>s, between the second and third bays of the west and east elevations of the building. The building rests on a sandstone, <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> block foundation. Its gable roof is sheathed with <a href="Metal%20roof">standing seam tin sheeting</a>.

Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula

The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, also known as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a <a href="mathematical%20formula">mathematical formula</a> in use in the United States by <a href="truck%20drivers">truck drivers</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a <a href="commercial%20motor%20vehicle">commercial motor vehicle</a> (CMV) based on <a href="axle">axle</a> number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often <a href="tractor-trailer">tractor-trailer</a>s or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.

Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted to protect dirt and gravel roads from damage caused by the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused primarily on <a href="gross%20weight">gross weight</a> limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from the damage caused by the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a>.

Compliance with the law is checked when vehicles pass through a <a href="weigh%20station">weigh station</a>, often located at the borders between <a href="U.S.%20states">states</a> or on the outskirts of <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population">major cities</a>, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the <a href="American%20Trucking%20Associations">American Trucking Associations</a> to allow <a href="tank%20truck">tank truck</a>s to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.

The first truck weight limits were enacted by four states in 1913, ranging from in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> to in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. These laws were passed to protect earth and gravel-surfaced roads from damage caused by the steel and solid rubber wheels of early heavy trucks. By 1933, all states had some form of truck weight regulation. The <a href="Federal-Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</a> instituted the first federal truck weight regulation (set at ) and authorized the construction of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>.

In the late 1950s, the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) conducted a series of extensive <a href="AASHO%20Road%20Test">field tests</a> of roads and bridges to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of <a href="Pavement%20%28material%29">pavement materials</a>. In 1964, the AASHTO recommended to Congress that a bridge formula table be used instead of a single gross weight limit for trucks. The <a href="Federal-Aid%20Highway%20Act%20Amendments%20of%201974">Federal-Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974</a> established the bridge formula as law, along with the gross weight limit of . Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 feet or more length between axle sets, and a maximum load of 105,500 lbs.

The formula was enacted as law to limit the weight-to-length ratio of a <a href="commercial%20motor%20vehicle">commercial motor vehicle</a> (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a <a href="bridge%20collapse">bridge collapse</a>). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated at the bottom of their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.

A division of the DOT, the <a href="Federal%20Motor%20Carrier%20Safety%20Administration">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA), regulates safety for the <a href="Trucking%20industry%20in%20the%20United%20States">U.S. trucking industry</a>. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA) for "interstate" commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highways</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Highways">U.S. Highways</a>, and <a href="state%20highways">state highways</a> known as the <a href="National%20Network">National Network</a> (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it is not subject to state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for "intrastate" commercial traffic, provided the vehicle is not on the NN.

CMVs are defined by the FMCSA as vehicles engaged in interstate commerce that are used to transport passengers or property: vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of or more; those designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers (including the driver) for compensation; vehicles designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers (including the driver) without compensation; or those used to transport <a href="hazardous%20materials">hazardous materials</a> in quantities requiring the vehicle to be marked or <a href="placard">placard</a>ed under <a href="hazardous%20materials">hazardous materials</a> regulations.

The weight and size of CMVs are restricted for practical and safety reasons. CMVs are restricted by gross weight (total weight of vehicle and cargo), and by axle weight (i.e., the weight carried by each tire). The federal weight limits for CMVs are for gross weight (unless the bridge formula dictates a lower limit), for a tandem axle, and for a single axle. A tandem axle is defined as two or more consecutive axles whose centers are spaced more than but not more than apart. Axles spaced less than apart are considered a single axle.

In effect, the formula reduces the legal weight limit for shorter trucks with fewer axles (see <a href="Federal%20Bridge%20Gross%20Weight%20Formula%23Bridge%20formula%20table">table</a> below). For example, a three-axle <a href="dump%20truck">dump truck</a> would have a gross weight limit of , instead of , which is the standard weight limit for five-axle tractor-trailer. FHWA regulation §658.17 states: "The maximum gross vehicle weight shall be except where lower gross vehicle weight is dictated by the bridge formula."

The August 2007 collapse of the <a href="Interstate%2035W%20Mississippi%20River%20bridge">Interstate 35W Mississippi River bridge</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> brought renewed attention to the issue of truck weights and their relation to bridge stress. In November 2008, the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> determined there had been several reasons for the bridge's collapse, including (but not limited to): faulty <a href="gusset%20plate">gusset plate</a>s, inadequate inspections, and the extra weight of heavy construction equipment combined with the weight of rush hour traffic. The I-35 Trade Corridor Study reported that the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA) expressed concern over bridges on the <a href="I-35">I-35</a> corridor due to an expected increase of international truck traffic from <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, with the FHWA listing it as "high-priority" in 2005.

As of 2007, federal estimates suggest truck traffic increased 216% since 1970, shortly before the federal gross weight limit for trucks was increased by . This is also the period during which many of the existing interstate bridges were built. Research shows that increased truck traffic (and therefore, increased stress) shortens the life of bridges. National Pavement Cost Model (NAPCOM) estimates indicate that one truck does as much damage to roads as 750 cars.

Some smaller bridges have a weight limit (or gross weight load rating) indicated by a sign posted in a visible position in front of the bridge (hence the reference to a "posted bridge"). These are necessary when the weight limit of the bridge is lower than the federal or state gross weight limit for trucks. Driving a truck over a bridge that is too weak to support it usually does not result in an immediate collapse. The bridge may develop cracks, which over time can weaken the bridge and cause it to collapse. Most of these cracks are discovered during mandated inspections of bridges. Most bridge collapses occur in rural areas, result in few injuries or deaths, and receive relatively little media attention. While the number varies from year to year, as many as 150 bridges can collapse in a year. About 1,500 bridges collapsed between 1966 and 2007, and most of those were the result of soil erosion around bridge supports. In 1987, the <a href="Schoharie%20Creek%20Bridge%20collapse">Schoharie Creek Bridge collapse</a>d in <a href="upstate%20New%20York">upstate New York</a>, due to erosion of soil around the foundation, which sparked renewed interest in bridge design in inspection procedures.

In special cases involving unusually <a href="Oversize/overweight%20load">overweight trucks</a> (which require special permits), not observing a bridge weight limit can lead to disastrous consequences. Fifteen days after the collapse of the Minneapolis bridge, a heavy truck collapsed a small bridge in <a href="Oakville%2C%20Washington">Oakville, Washington</a>.

CMVs are required to pass through <a href="weigh%20station">weigh station</a>s at the borders of most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground <a href="truck%20scales">truck scales</a>, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.

FMCSA regulation §658.17 states:

Two or more consecutive axles may not exceed the weight computed by the bridge formula, even if the gross weight of the truck (or the weight on one axle) is below otherwise legal limits. Although this means that any two axles must comply with the formula, experience has shown that axles 1 through 3, 1 through 5, and 2 through 5 are critical and must be checked. This means that the axle group which comprises the entire truck (known as the "outer group") and the interior axle groups (known as the "tractor group" and "trailer group") must also comply with the bridge formula. If these combinations are found to be satisfactory, then all of the other axle groups on this type of vehicle will usually be satisfactory.

Penalties for violating weight limits vary between states (bridge formula weight violations are treated as gross weight violations), as the states are responsible for enforcement and collection of fines. Some states, such as <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, issue fines on a percentage basis (e.g. 20% overweight at $10 per ), which means larger trucks pay higher fines. For example, a truck with a legal gross limit of that violates the limit by would pay a fine of $500, while a truck with a legal gross limit of that violates the limit by 5,000 pounds would pay a fine of $250. Other states, such as <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, issue fines on a per-pound basis (e.g., 5,000 pounds overweight equals a $300 fine). Others, such as <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, impose a less complicated fine schedule whereby a vehicle that violates the limits by less than is fined $40 per , while a violation over pays $80 per (e.g. overweight equals a $200 fine).

Some states require overweight trucks to offload enough cargo to comply with the limits. In <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, any vehicle that exceeds the limits by more than is required to be unloaded until the vehicle is in compliance. Florida also includes a scale tolerance, which allows for violations of less than 10% to be forgiven, and no fine issued. Florida also allows for a load to be shifted (e.g., moved from the front towards the rear of the vehicle) for the vehicle to comply with axle weight limits, without penalty.

There is one exception to the formula: two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry each if the overall distance between the first and last axles of these tandems is or more. For example, a five-axle truck may carry 34,000 pounds both on the tractor tandem axles (2 and 3) and the trailer tandem axles (4 and 5), provided axles 2 and 5 are spaced at least apart.

This exception allows for the standard 5-axle semi-truck configuration to gross up to (the legal limit) without being in violation of the bridge formula law. Without it, the bridge formula would allow an actual weight of only to on tandems spaced to apart; compared to with the exception. This exception was sought by the <a href="American%20Trucking%20Associations">American Trucking Associations</a> so trucking companies could use trailers and weigh . It was the only way <a href="tank%20truck">tank truck</a> operators could reach 80,000 pounds without adding axles to their fleets of trailers already in operation.

A CMV may exceed the bridge formula limits (or gross weight and its axle weight limits) by up to if the vehicle is equipped with an <a href="Auxiliary%20power%20unit%23Commercial%20vehicles">auxiliary power unit</a> (APU) or <a href="idle%20reduction">idle reduction</a> technology. According to the FMCSA, this is permitted "in order to promote reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling". To be eligible, the vehicle's operator must prove the weight of the APU with written certification, or—by demonstration or certification—that the idle reduction technology is fully functional at all times. Certification of the APU's weight must be available to law enforcement officers if the vehicle is found in violation of applicable weight laws. The additional weight allowed cannot exceed 400 pounds or the weight certified, whichever is less.

The bridge formula (also referred to as Formula B) is based on research into single-<a href="Span%20%28architecture%29">span</a> bridges, and fails to consider multiple-span bridges. Two-span bridges may not be fully protected by Formula B, depending on the truck length, span length, and other factors. Shorter wheelbase vehicles (usually specialized trucks such as <a href="garbage%20trucks">garbage trucks</a> and water trucks) have trouble complying with Formula B.

In 1987, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> passed the <a href="Surface%20Transportation%20and%20Uniform%20Relocation%20Assistance%20Act%20of%201987">Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act</a>, requesting the <a href="Transportation%20Research%20Board">Transportation Research Board</a> (TRB) to conduct a study to develop alternatives to Formula B. The study recommended several that were never implemented. It suggested that Formula B was too strict for trucks with shorter axle lengths. One of the alternative formulas (later known as the TTI HS-20 Bridge Formula) was developed in conjunction with the <a href="Texas%20Transportation%20Institute">Texas Transportation Institute</a>. TTI HS-20 allowed shorter trucks to have higher weight limits than Formula B. For a 3-axle truck with an axle length of , the weight limit increased from to . TTI HS-20 also failed to address the problem of multiple-span bridges.

Suillellus luridus

Suillellus luridus (formerly Boletus luridus), commonly known as the lurid bolete, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> of the <a href="Boletaceae">bolete family</a>, found in <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous woodlands</a> on <a href="calcareous">chalky</a> soils in Asia, Europe, and eastern North America. <a href="Basidiocarp">Fruit bodies</a> appear in summer and autumn and may be abundant. It is a solid bolete with an olive-brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to in diameter, with small red <a href="Hymenophore">pores</a> on the underside. The stout ochre <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> reaches high and wide, and is patterned with a red mesh-work. Like several other red-pored boletes, it stains blue when bruised or cut. Though <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when cooked, it can cause <a href="Foodborne%20illness">gastric upset</a> when eaten raw and can be confused with the <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> "<a href="Boletus%20satanas">Boletus satanas</a>", though the latter species has a pale cap; as a result, some guidebooks recommend avoiding consumption altogether. When consumed with alcohol, "Suillellus luridus" has been implicated in causing adverse reactions similar to those caused by the compound <a href="coprine">coprine</a>, though laboratory testing has not revealed any evidence of coprine in the mushroom.

First described in 1774, the species has been transferred to various Boletaceae genera in its <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Schaeffer">Jacob Christian Schaeffer</a> until a transfer to genus "<a href="Suillellus">Suillellus</a>" in 2014. Several <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a>, a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, and a <a href="form%20%28botany%29">form</a> have been described by European mycologists. "Suillellus luridus" is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l, forming a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> association with <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees such as <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a>, and has been found to have a growth-enhancing effect on <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of <a href="diptera">fly</a> have been recorded <a href="mycophagy">feeding</a> on them. Chemical analyses have revealed some aspects of the mushroom's components, including its <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> flavour compounds, its <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a> and <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> compositions, and the identities of the <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> compounds responsible for its colour.

"Boletus luridus" was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by German botanist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> in 1774, in his series on fungi of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and the <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a>, "Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones." The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "luridus", '<a href="wikt%3Asallow">sallow</a>'. French botanist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a>'s 1791 "Boletus rubeolarius" is a heterotypic <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> (based on a different <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a>). The following year, <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> called it "Boletus subvescus", from the Latin words "sub" "nearly" or "under", and "vescus" "edible". However, this is a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>". Several <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> synonyms arose when the species was transferred to different genera within the family <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a> by different authorities, including "<a href="Leccinum">Leccinum</a>" by <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> in 1821, "Tubiporus" by <a href="Petter%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> in 1881, "Dictyopus" by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1888, and "Suillellus" by <a href="William%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> in 1909.

The <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "Boletus luridus" var. "erythropus", published as "beta" by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in his 1821 "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>", is synonymous with "<a href="Boletus%20erythropus">Boletus erythropus</a>". "Boletus luridus" var. "rubriceps" was originally described from Spain (as a species of "Tubiporus") by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Maire">René Maire</a> in 1937, and later formally transferred to "Boletus" by <a href="Aurel%20Dermek">Aurel Dermek</a> in 1987. Other varieties of "B. luridus" include Roman Schulz's var. "obscurus" and var. "rubromaculatus" published in 1924; <a href="Josef%20Velenovsk%C3%BD">Josef Velenovský</a>'s 1939 var. "tenuipes", found in the Czech Republic; and Jean Blum's 1969 var. "lupiniformis" and var. "queletiformis", originally described from France and Spain, respectively. "Boletus erythrentheron", originally described as a distinct species by <a href="Jan%20Bezd%C4%9Bk">Jan Bezděk</a>, was later published as the variety "B. luridus" var. "erythrentheron" by <a href="Albert%20Pil%C3%A1t">Albert Pilát</a> and Dermek in 1979, and finally as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> by Jiri Hlavácek in 1995. Carmine Lavorato and Giampaolo Simonini defined the <a href="form%20%28botany%29">form</a> "primulicolor" from <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> in 1997. Rolf Singer's 1947 variety "caucasicus" is currently considered an independent species, "<a href="Boletus%20caucasicus">Boletus caucasicus</a>" Singer ex. Alessio. Similarly, "B. luridus" f. "sinensis", found in <a href="Hainan%20Province">Hainan Province</a>, China, was later elevated to distinct species status as "<a href="Boletus%20sinensis">B. sinensis</a>".

"Boletus luridus" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Boletus" <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Luridi", originally circumscribed by Fries in 1838. This section includes species producing medium to large fruit bodies with thick, swollen stems, and minute pores that are coloured red, orange, or brown. However, the genus as a whole is strongly <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> and has been partly fragmented as further studies have resolved relationships to a finer detail. Manfred Binder and <a href="David%20Hibbett">David Hibbett</a> showed "B. luridus" to be most closely related to a group containing "<a href="Boletus%20torosus">B. torosus</a>" and "<a href="Boletus%20luteocupreus">B. luteocupreus</a>", with "<a href="Boletus%20vermiculosus">B. vermiculosus</a>" and "<a href="Pulveroboletus%20ravenelii">Pulveroboletus ravenelii</a>" as more distant relatives, based on <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> inferred from <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> sequences. In a separate molecular study of ten frequently eaten European boletes, "B. luridus" clustered together with "<a href="Boletus%20rhodoxanthus">B. rhodoxanthus</a>". Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that "B. luridus" and many (but not all) red-pored boletes are part of a "dupainii" clade (named for "<a href="Boletus%20dupainii">Boletus dupainii</a>"), well-removed from the core group of "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" and relatives within the Boletineae. For this reason, it is now considered a species of "Suillellus".

The English <a href="common%20name">common name</a> is lurid bolete. Both it and "<a href="Boletus%20satanas">Boletus satanas</a>" are known as "ayimantari", "bear mushroom", in Eastern Turkey.

"Suillellus luridus" is a stout fungus with a thick yellow-olive to olive-brown convex cushion-shaped <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> that can reach in diameter. The cap colour tends to darken with age, and regions of red, orange, purple, brown, or olive-green can develop in maturity. The cap surface is <a href="tomentose">tomentose</a> (velvety), becoming smoother with old age, and sticky in wet weather. The pore surface is initially dark red before turning orange-red, and has a lighter-coloured zone encircling the margin. There are 2–3 circular pores per millimetre, and the <a href="Hymenophore">tubes</a> are deep. The tubes are shorter around the cap margin and close to the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, where they form a circular depression. Initially pale yellow, the tubes gradually become olive-yellow and then bluish-green upon exposure to air. A characteristic feature is the presence of a <a href="maroon%20%28color%29">maroon</a> layer between the tubes and the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a>. The thick stem is tall and wide, and bears a distinctive orange-red meshlike pattern on a paler yellowish or ochre background. The flesh is yellowish, with red marks in the cap, and stains an intense dark blue when bruised or broken. There is a faint sour smell, and the taste is described as mild.

Variety "queletiformis" can be distinguished from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety "rubriceps" has a deep crimson red cap, while var. "lupiniformis" has a pale yellow or dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore dust</a> is <a href="olive%20%28color%29">olive</a> to brownish olive. The spores are oval to somewhat <a href="wikt%3Afusiform">fuse</a>-shaped, measuring 11–15 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> long by 4.5–6.5 μm wide. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, and measure 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4 μm. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> on the sides of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5 μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8 μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8 μm. Hyphae do not contain <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s. The <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> is an unusual yellow colour.

Some <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> can be used to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while <a href="ferrous%20sulphate">ferrous sulphate</a> solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.

Also found on <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> (chalky) soils, "Rubroboletus satanas" is larger and has a pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of "S. luridus". Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible "<a href="Neoboletus%20luridiformis">Neoboletus luridiformis</a>" can be distinguished from "S. luridus" by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can be confused with the poisonous "<a href="Rubroboletus%20pulcherrimus">Rubroboletus pulcherrimus</a>", which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> under oak, "<a href="Boletus%20vinaceobasis">Boletus vinaceobasis</a>" resembles "S. luridus" but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. "Boletus" species that share a similar appearance with "S. luridus" but lack reticulation in their stems include "<a href="Boletus%20subvelutipes">B. subvelutipes</a>" (found in North America and Asia) and "<a href="Boletus%20hypocarycinus">B. hypocarycinus</a>" (United States).

"Boletus caucasicus", found in southern Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, in contrast to the reddish colour of the same flesh found in "S. luridus". Another European species, "<a href="Rubroboletus%20rhodoxanthus">Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus</a>", has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species "<a href="Neoboletus%20sinensis">Neoboletus sinensis</a>", originally described as a form of "S. luridus", can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have been reported to be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7 μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling "S. luridus" have been recorded in Australia, though renamed "<a href="Boletus%20barragensis">Boletus barragensis</a>" as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family <a href="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</a>.

The fungus grows in a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association with <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees such as <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a> on chalky soils. It is also suspected of being a mycorrhizal associate of <a href="subshrub">subshrub</a> <a href="rock%20rose">rock rose</a>s in the genus "<a href="Helianthemum">Helianthemum</a>". Field studies indicate that the fungus, when paired as a mycorrhizal partner with seedlings of the conifer "<a href="Cunninghamia">Cunninghamia lanceolata</a>", increases the seedling's survival rate, augments its height and ground diameter, and increases the <a href="chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> content in the leaves. A similar growth-enhancing effect had been noted earlier with "<a href="Pinus%20taiwanensis">Pinus taiwanensis</a>" seedlings. These beneficial effects on plant growth are a result of multiple interactions among the fungus, host plant, and indigenous soil microbes that increase the <a href="biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a> of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, and increase the bacterial <a href="biodiversity">diversity</a> in the <a href="mycorrhizosphere">mycorrhizosphere</a>. In a study comparing the <a href="Halotolerance">salinity resistance</a> of three common ectomycorrhizal fungi (the others were "<a href="Suillus%20bovinus">Suillus bovinus</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20luteus">S. luteus</a>"), "S. luridus" was the most tolerant to high concentrations of salt, and is a good candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be planted on saline soil. Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground, from June to November after summer rains. "S. luridus" may occur in parks near a single tree, though it will not be found in <a href="soil%20pH">acidic soils</a>.

The predilection of insects for this mushroom was noted by 19th-century British mycologist <a href="Anna%20Maria%20Hussey">Anna Maria Hussey</a>, who wrote in 1847: there are very few of the soft-fleshed tribes, all of which are the nurseries of innumerable insects, so much in favour as the poisonous "Boletus luridus", on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae. Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects that it is very rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life, and being a very common and abundant kind, it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence. Several fly species have been recorded <a href="mycophagy">feeding</a> on the fruit bodies, including "<a href="Phaonia%20boleticola">Phaonia boleticola</a>", "<a href="Phaonia%20rufipalpis">P. rufipalpis</a>", "<a href="Thricops%20diaphanus">Thricops diaphanus</a>", and, in North America, "<a href="Drosophila%20falleni">Drosophila falleni</a>", "<a href="Pegomya%20mallochi">Pegomya mallochi</a>", "<a href="Pegomya%20winthemi">P. winthemi</a>", "<a href="Megaselia%20pygmaeoides">Megaselia pygmaeoides</a>", and "<a href="Muscina%20assimilis">Muscina assimilis</a>". In contrast, <a href="slug">slug</a>s tend to avoid consuming this species.

The fungus is widespread in Europe, east to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> region and eastern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> in Turkey, and Pakistan, where it has been recorded from <a href="Khanspur">Khanspur</a>, Kuzagali, <a href="Sudhan%20Gali">Sudhan Gali</a> and Hajinpir. In North America, it is known from eastern Canada and the United States east of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, although in one instance it was found in <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>. Its range extends south to Mexico, and it has been recorded once from <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. In Asia, it has been found in the Bar'am Forest in the <a href="Upper%20Galilee">Upper Galilee</a> in northern Israel, and India. Taiwan, It is widely distributed in China, having been found in <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a>, <a href="Jiangsu">Jiangsu</a>, <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a>, <a href="Henan">Henan</a>, <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, and <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> provinces. The variety "rubriceps" has been recorded growing under linden ("<a href="Tilia">Tilia</a>") in the Czech Republic.

Mild tasting, "Suillellus luridus" is edible after thorough cooking and is highly regarded in France. It is also commonly consumed in Italy and China. The mushroom is sold in regional markets in central Mexico; despite this, it is considered inedible by inhabitants of <a href="La%20Malinche%20National%20Park">La Malinche National Park</a>. Caution is advised if choosing this species for consumption, as it resembles other less edible blue-staining boletes. Some guidebooks recommend avoiding it altogether. If eaten raw or insufficiently cooked, symptoms of <a href="Foodborne%20illness">gastrointestinal poisoning</a> can occur within 30 minutes to two hours, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea. A full recovery can be expected within 24 to 48 hours if fluid losses are restored. Chemical analysis has revealed traces of the toxin <a href="muscarine">muscarine</a> and its <a href="stereoisomerism">stereoisomers</a>.

"Suillellus luridus" has been suspected of causing an enhanced alcohol sensitivity similar to that caused by the common ink cap ("<a href="Coprinopsis%20atramentaria">Coprinopsis atramentaria</a>"), with gastric symptoms. A German mycologist reported having suffered symptoms himself upon imbibing alcohol with this "otherwise excellent" mushroom. A 1982 report of three cases from Switzerland further incriminated the species, yet a 1994 study casts doubt on this; researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for <a href="antabuse">antabuse</a>-like compound <a href="coprine">coprine</a> content in "S. luridus" and similar species, and found none in the historical suspect but did find indications for it in the rare "<a href="Boletus%20torosus">B. torosus</a>". They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical incidents was a misidentification of "B. torosus" with "S. luridus", though they could not rule out "S. luridus" containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions.

The composition of the <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> flavour compounds of "Suillellus luridus" consists largely of <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a>, with smaller proportions of <a href="1-butanol">1-butanol</a>, <a href="3-methyl-1-butanol">3-methyl-1-butanol</a>, <a href="pentadecanoic%20acid">pentadecanoic acid</a>, <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a>, linoleic acid <a href="Fatty%20acid%20methyl%20ester">methyl ester</a>, and <a href="heptadecanoic%20acid">heptadecanoic acid</a>. <a href="Pyrazine">Pyrazine</a> compounds might be responsible for the characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant <a href="sterol">sterol</a> present in the fruit bodies is <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a>, with smaller amounts of closely related <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivative</a> compounds. The main <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). <a href="Arginine">Arginine</a> is the free <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> found in the highest concentration (96.9 <a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">μM</a> per gram of <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>), followed by <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a> (9.7) and <a href="alanine">alanine</a> (8.2).

The <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> content of the fruit bodies differs substantially between the cap, the tubes, and the stem. The upper part of the cap, which contains 3.1 <a href="microgram">microgram</a>s of carotenoid per gram (µg/g) fresh weight, has predominantly <a href="mutatochrome">mutatochrome</a> (47% of total carotenoids), <a href="alpha-Carotene">4-keto-α-carotene</a> (40.2%), and <a href="%CE%B4-carotene">δ-carotene</a> (6.4%). The major carotenoids in the tubes (totaling 4.3 µg/g) include <a href="neurosporaxanthin">neurosporaxanthin</a> (31.1%), <a href="auroxanthin">auroxanthin</a> (17.2%), 4-keto-α-carotene (17.1%), and <a href="rhodopin">rhodopin</a> (15.8%). The stem (1.2 µg/g) contains primarily auroxanthin (32.5%), followed by 4-keto-α-carotene (19.9%), <a href="Beta-zeacarotene">β-zeacarotene</a> (18.5%), and rhodopin (11.4%). The colour change observed with tissue injury is caused by <a href="variegatic%20acid">variegatic</a> and <a href="xerocomic%20acid">xerocomic acid</a>s, both of which turn blue when <a href="oxidative%20enzyme">oxidized enzymatically</a> upon exposure to air.

<a href="Air%20marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Marshal</a> Sir Colin Thomas Hannah, (22 December 1914 – 22 May 1978) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and a <a href="Governor%20of%20Queensland">Governor of Queensland</a>. Born in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, he was a member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> before joining the RAAF in 1935. After graduating as a pilot, Hannah served in <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 22</a> and <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">23 Squadrons</a> from 1936 to 1939. During the early years of World War II, he was the RAAF's Deputy Director of Armament. He then saw action in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> as commander of <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 Squadron</a> and, later, <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>, operating <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> bombers. By 1944, he had risen to the rank of <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, and at the end of the war was in charge of <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area Command</a> in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>.

Hannah commanded <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Station Amberley</a>, Queensland, in 1949–50, and saw service during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> as senior air staff officer at , Singapore, from 1956 to 1959. His other post-war appointments included <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1961 to 1965, <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Operational Command</a> from 1965 to 1967, and AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a> from 1968 to 1969. In January 1970, he was promoted to air marshal and became <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knighted</a> in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He attracted controversy in this role after making comments critical of the <a href="Whitlam%20Government">Federal government</a> of the day, and the British government refused to agree to his term being extended. Hannah retired in March 1977, and died the following year.

Born on 22 December 1914 in <a href="Menzies%2C%20Western%20Australia">Menzies</a>, Western Australia, Hannah was the son of Thomas Howard Hannah, the local mining registrar and Clerk of Courts, and his wife Johanna Frame. In 1936 Thomas Hannah was appointed Acting Magistrate of the Eastern Goldfields, and in 1939, Magistrate of the Local Court in Perth.

Hannah attended <a href="Hale%20School">Hale School</a>, leaving with a Junior Certificate in 1930. He served with an <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Australian Militia</a> unit, the 8th Field Artillery Brigade, from February 1933, and became a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the State Public Service later that year.

Hannah joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> on 15 January 1935 as an air cadet at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Point%20Cook">RAAF Station Point Cook</a>, Victoria. After graduating from <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 FTS), he obtained his commission as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in July 1936. His first posting was to <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales. Promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, he was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> with the newly formed <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 23 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Laverton">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, in May 1937. Hannah accompanied the squadron, which operated <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s and <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, to its new location at the recently opened <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Pearce">RAAF Station Pearce</a>, Western Australia, in March 1938. On 5 January 1939, he married Patricia Gordon at <a href="Claremont%2C%20Western%20Australia">Claremont</a>; the couple had a daughter. Having specialised as an <a href="flight%20instructor">instructor</a>, he then served on the staff of No. 1 FTS, Point Cook.

Promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, Hannah was posted to Britain in July 1939 to undertake a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> armaments training course, which he had barely begun when war was declared on 3 September. He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No. 1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Station Headquarters Laverton, he was assigned to Air Force Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, in May. He was made an acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted to temporary <a href="wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>. He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May.

In November 1943, Hannah was appointed commanding officer of <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 Squadron</a> at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, Papua, flying <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light bombers. During a familiarisation flight he came under <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> from <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> on <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina Island</a>, but avoided serious injury. He was raised to temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in December, and assumed command of <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a> the following month. The Beauforts of No. 6 Squadron and No. 71 Wing took part in a series of <a href="Bombing%20of%20Rabaul%20%28November%201943%29">major attacks on Rabaul</a>, bombing and strafing airfields, infrastructure and shipping; this continued until February 1944, when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul. The same month, Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia. After six weeks recuperation at Laverton, he returned to No. 6 Squadron, based on <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>. From March to August, the squadron was mainly involved in convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. In September 1944, Hannah was appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Headquarters Western Area Command</a>, Perth. He took over control of the formation from Air Commodore <a href="Raymond%20Brownell">Raymond Brownell</a> in July 1945, following Brownell's departure to command <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAAF">No. 11 Group</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>.

Hannah handed over command of Western Area in October 1946, and was posted to Britain. Over the next two years, he undertook study at <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, and served as SASO at <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a> in London. Returning to Australia, in May 1949 he assumed command of <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Amberley">RAAF Station Amberley</a>, Queensland. From August 1950, he also held temporary command of the base's <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> heavy bomber formation, <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 Wing</a>. Promoted to substantive group captain in October 1950, Hannah was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in the 1951 <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">New Year Honours</a>, in particular for his "exceptional ability" as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters. In September that year, he was made Director of Personnel Services; his position became Director-General of Personnel in July 1952. As <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, Hannah was heavily involved in planning the RAAF's part in the <a href="1954%20Royal%20Tour%20of%20Australia">1954 Royal Tour of Australia</a>. He was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> that June.

In 1955, Hannah attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in London, and was promoted to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>. He was posted to Singapore as SASO, <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters</a>, in January 1956, handling <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> operations during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. Hannah's "distinguished service" during the conflict was recognised with his appointment as a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in June 1959. As Director-General of Plans and Policy from March 1959, he was responsible for commencing the Department of Air's relocation from Melbourne to <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. In December 1961, Hannah was appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>, receiving promotion to acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963. He was later described by his staff officer in this role as "brusque" and "impersonal" though not unsympathetic, his "uncommunicative" manner stemming from a preference to "do his own research, think out the substance of his project submissions, dictate to his stenographer, then amend to his own satisfaction", rather than delegate. Hannah served as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) Operational Command (now <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>) from February 1965 to December 1967, during which time the RAAF's fighter squadrons completed their conversion from the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> to the supersonic <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a>. His tenure also saw the deployment of the first Australian helicopters to <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a>, eight <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> of <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 9 Squadron</a> that departed Sydney in May 1966. Hannah's next appointment was as AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>, responsible for training and maintenance in the Air Force. Throughout his career to this point he was noted for his energy and drive.

Hannah was promoted to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> on 1 January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Sir Alister Murdoch</a> as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah, known to be a strong advocate for <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Australian participation in the Vietnam War</a>, for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969; the post went to an <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> officer, and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah's tour as CAS. In March 1970, the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>, commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to "avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force". Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>, Admiral <a href="Victor%20Smith">Sir Victor Smith</a>, to use the soon-to-be-delivered <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">F-111 bomber</a> for maritime support, among other roles.

In the 1971 New Year Honours, Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's <a href="Golden%20Jubilee">Golden Jubilee</a>, celebrated in March and April that year. He personally organised a fly-past of two <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> F-111s at <a href="air%20show">air show</a>s marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service. He was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, he was a member of the committee to choose an <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force%20Memorial">Air Force memorial</a> to be located on <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade</a>, Canberra. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, reflected "the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service". Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade "somewhere between royal and navy blue" that had been personally chosen by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour. Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved, an all-purpose middle-blue suit, at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8 December 1971. It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years; personnel complained of being mistaken for bus, train and postal employees. One of Hannah's successors as CAS, Air Marshal <a href="Errol%20McCormack">Errol McCormack</a>, ordered that the uniform revert to Williams' original colour and style commencing in 2000.

Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted an offer to serve as <a href="Governor%20of%20Queensland">Governor of Queensland</a>, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a <a href="Viceroy">vice-regal</a> appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21 March. He succeeded <a href="Alan%20Mansfield">Sir Alan Mansfield</a>. Hannah did not have a strong connection with Queensland at the time of his appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a>.

Described when he took office as "a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people, so necessary for a Governor", Hannah was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> (KCMG) and a <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John</a> in September 1972. His term as Governor was relatively uneventful until 1975. In October that year, he created controversy at a <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> Chamber of Commerce luncheon by criticising the "fumbling ineptitude" of Prime Minister <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>'s Federal <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government for placing Australia in "its present economic state". Vice-regal appointees in Australia were expected to remain above politics, but Hannah declared that he would be "guilty of sheltering behind convention, of denying my heritage and failing in my regard for the people of Queensland" if he did not speak his mind. The incident occurred in the midst of a <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">constitutional crisis</a> and, according to military historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, was "widely seen as a blatant intervention in the national political arena". The Federal government responded by advising the Queen to revoke Hannah's <a href="dormant%20commission">dormant commission</a> to serve in place of the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> if required; at the time Hannah was the second in line to serve as Governor-General, after the <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>. Following his succession in November 1975, <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated, but the Queen – apparently following advice from the British government that cited Hannah's lack of impartiality – refused her assent. When Queensland Premier <a href="Joh%20Bjelke-Petersen">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a> sought to extend the Governor's term, the British government again declined. When Bjelke-Petersen sought to pursue the matter further, Hannah declined to let his name be put forward again.

On 9 October 1976, Hannah dedicated a memorial at <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> to commemorate the crews of RAAF <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Catalina flying boats</a> who lost their lives in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific during World War II</a>. His vice-regal appointment lapsed on 20 March 1977, and he was succeeded the next month by Commodore <a href="James%20Ramsay%20%28Australian%20governor%29">Sir James Ramsay</a>.

Hannah retired following completion of his term as Governor of Queensland. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (KCVO) in August 1977 (backdated to March) as part of <a href="Silver%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee</a> visit to Australia. Hannah died of a heart attack on 22 May 1978 at his home in <a href="Surfers%20Paradise%2C%20Queensland">Surfers Paradise</a>, Queensland. He was given a state funeral and cremated; his wife and daughter survived him. Hannah Community Park, straddling the suburbs of <a href="Fadden%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Fadden</a> and <a href="Gowrie%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Gowrie</a> in Canberra, was established in his honour in 2002.

Flocke

Flocke () is a female <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> who was born in captivity at the <a href="Tiergarten%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Nuremberg Zoo</a> in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, Germany on 11 December 2007. A few weeks after her birth, she was removed from her mother's care after concerns were raised for her safety. Although the zoo had established a strict non-interference policy with its animals, officials chose to raise the cub by hand. This decision came at a time when the zoo was receiving negative attention from the media after another female polar bear reportedly ate her newly born cubs.

Like <a href="Knut%20%28polar%20bear%29">Knut</a>, a captive-born and handraised polar bear at the <a href="Berlin%20Zoo">Berlin Zoo</a>, Flocke ("flake" in German) quickly became a media sensation. After she made her debut to the public on 8 April 2008, her name was trademarked by the zoo and her image appeared on toys and in advertisements throughout the city. The zoo announced in May 2008 that United Nations Environment Program chief <a href="Achim%20Steiner">Achim Steiner</a> would be Flocke's official patron with the hope of using the bear as an ambassador to encourage awareness of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. In late 2008, a Russian-born male polar bear named Rasputin was introduced to Flocke's enclosure in the hopes that she would gain valuable socializing skills with a member of her own species. In April 2010, both bears were relocated to <a href="Marineland%20%28Antibes%29">Marineland</a> in southern France.

Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo on 11 December 2007 to Vera (born 2002 in Moscow) and Felix (born 2001 in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>). Felix also mated with Vera's sister Vilma, who gave birth some weeks earlier in November to what officials thought were two cubs. Zookeepers, enforcing a strict non-interference policy, were not able to determine exactly how many cubs were born. The zoo reportedly did not wish to create a <a href="media%20circus">media circus</a> similar to the one that surrounded <a href="Knut%20%28polar%20bear%29">Knut</a>, an orphaned polar bear at the <a href="Berlin%20Zoo">Berlin Zoo</a> who became an international celebrity the previous year. Days after the zoo reaffirmed its non-interference policy, mass circulation daily "<a href="Bild">Bild</a>" ran a story with a headline reading "Why Won't Anyone Save the Cute Baby Knuts in Nuremberg Zoo?"

At the beginning of January, zoo keepers noticed that Vilma appeared nervous; she was seen agitatedly scratching at her feedbox, and there was no further sign of her cubs. It is believed that she devoured them. When asked for a reason, Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke stated that they could have been ill, a circumstance under which polar bears in the wild often eat their young. The zoo quickly faced harsh criticism throughout Germany and from the worldwide media for appearing to allow the cubs' death. The director of the German Animal Protection Society said the zoo had acted irresponsibly and that "it was the ethical responsibility of the management to give the polar bear cubs a chance of life. Using the argument 'That's Nature' as an excuse for intervening far too late is cynical and inappropriate." Angry visitors gathered in front of the polar bear enclosure and shouted "Rabenmutter" (literally, "raven mother", meaning "evil mother") every time Vilma appeared.

Meanwhile, Vera was seen emerging from her den for the first time; her single cub, helpless at only four weeks old, appeared to be in good health. A couple of days after the media backlash that followed Vilma's missing cubs, Vera began displaying strange behavior such as carrying her then-unnamed cub around the enclosure and repeatedly dropping it on the hard rock floor. Concerned for the cub's safety, the Nuremberg Zoo made a controversial decision to remove her from her mother's care and raise her by hand.

Less than a week after Vera's cub was removed from the polar bear enclosure, the zoo dedicated a website to the cub. It provided frequent updates on her health and development, as well as exclusive photographs and videos. The website also showcased a competition in which fans could vote for the cub's name. The official name was announced on 18 January 2008 by <a href="Ulrich%20Maly">Ulrich Maly</a>, mayor of Nuremberg, and broadcast live on television. Despite the overwhelming number of e-mailed suggestions from across the world (including "Stella", "Knutschi", "Sissi" and "Yuki Chan"), the zoo officially named her Flocke, German for "flake", as in "snowflake". "Flocke", used widely by the media previous to her official naming, was the nickname originally given to her by zookeepers because of her white fur.

Flocke's growth was carefully reported by the media during her first few months. Four zookeepers took turns bottle-feeding the cub with 140 milliliters of artificial milk every four hours and news of her eyes opening for the first time made headlines a few days before she was officially named. At five weeks old, she was referred to by the publication "Bild" as "Mrs. Knut", suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they mature. As she grew, Flocke's diet was enriched with dog food, and boiled bones were supplied for her to chew on when she was three months old. She was soon taken to the zoo's beginners' pool to practice her swimming skills. The zoo had previously stated that they were seeking another orphaned polar or <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a> cub to raise alongside Flocke in order to improve her development.

On 8 April 2008, Flocke made her first public appearance in the polar bear enclosure that had once been home to Vilma; the adult polar bear had been relocated to another zoo. The four-month-old cub was greeted by more than 160 journalists and a half-dozen international camera crews on the first day. During the first week, Flocke was displayed for short intervals with breaks at midday. Expecting a peak of 20,000 visitors, the zoo built a viewing platform, capable of holding 500 people at a time, in front of the enclosure, but attendance by zoo patrons was initially lower than expected. The zoo uses a video transmission and recording system from <a href="Robert%20Bosch%20GmbH">Bosch</a> Security Systems to transmit TV-quality live images of the cub to a pair of large-format screens. This system, which includes one screen outside the enclosure, was implemented to help the zoo meet the demands of visitors wanting to catch a glimpse of Flocke.

Shortly after her debut, however, Flocke became the focus of controversy when prominent animal conservationist Jürgen Ortmüller, chairman of the Whale and Dolphin Protection Forum, hired a lawyer to stop Nuremberg Zoo's exploitation of the polar bear cub. Claiming that Flocke's public exposure would have damaging effects and that the zoo was only concerned about earning money, Ortmüller recruited high-profile lawyer <a href="Rolf%20Bossi">Rolf Bossi</a> to challenge them in court.

Soon after Flocke was rescued in January, the city secured branding rights to her name. An official logo was subsequently released by the zoo. Flocke became part of a major publicity campaign in Nuremberg when she was depicted along with the phrase "Knut war gestern" (Knut is yesterday's bear) on posters for the city's metropolitan region. These posters were displayed at numerous bus and train stops all over the city.

Dubbed "Flocke fever" by the press (similar to the "Knutmania" from the previous year), the cub's popularity soared in early 2008. Her image has been used for games, diaries, soft toys, DVDs, postcards and other items. The first product released, a Flocke-based board game that was released in February, was made by the <a href="F%C3%BCrth">Fuerth</a>-based firm Noris-Spiele, a unit of Georg Reulein GmbH & Co. KG. The well-known toy company <a href="Margarete%20Steiff%20GmbH">Steiff</a> began selling a variety of Flocke stuffed animals the following May. The income from the merchandise is currently going towards the zoo and to species survival programs.

In April 2008, the zoo decreased human interaction with the cub, hoping that one day she could coexist with members of her species and not be dependent on humans. Becoming more independent from her keepers, Flocke was reported often playing happily on her own. She was given a plastic "dummy", similar to a child's teething ring, tied to the bars on the inside of her stable door to suckle on while resting. This suckling caused the cub's nose to appear bent; her muzzle remained in this shape for some time before returning to normal.

At the age of six months, it was reported that Flocke, whose diet at the time consisted mostly of a kilogram of beef, assorted vegetables and a liter of puppy milk a day, was at the correct weight for her development at . The zoo's vet, Bernhard Neurohr, also remarked upon the bear's sweet tooth, stating that "Flocke is very enthusiastic about grapes, melon, kiwi fruit and pears", with a particular fondness for bananas.

United Nations Environment Program chief Achim Steiner became Flocke's official patron in May 2008. By assuming this role, Steiner acknowledged Nuremberg Zoo's efforts towards local climate protection, stating "I am happy to have been asked to become 'godfather' to Nuremberg's polar bear cub Flocke. I sincerely hope that during her lifetime we will be able to implement a global green economy."

In June 2008, a new poster campaign featuring Flocke was announced; its goal was strengthening public awareness of individuals' ability to protect Earth's climate. Sponsored by the Nuremberg Zoo in conjunction with the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region, the poster showed Flocke and the phrase "Klimaschutz beginnt vor Ort" ("Climate Protection Begins At Home"). The zoo also published a pocket-sized brochure featuring Flocke. Entitled "Little Guide to Climate Protection", it taught visitors how to decrease their <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions. The Nuremberg Zoo announced in September that it had reached its one millionth visitor for 2008—two months earlier than last year. Although ticket sales for the year increased due to Flocke's popularity, the numbers did not match high expectations. The same month it was announced that the cub, now weighing , would no longer have lunchtime breaks in her stable, and would remain in the enclosure throughout the day.

In late November 2008, Flocke's mother Vera gave birth to two cubs, who were fathered by Flocke's father, Felix. Although Vera was able to care for the new cubs without assistance from zoo keepers, Director Dag Encke initially stated that the cubs had a 50 percent chance of survival. Three weeks after their birth was reported, both cubs died of natural causes within one week of each other. Encke expressed regret after the second cub's death, stating that "Vera nursed regularly and the young animal always slept well afterwards, so it seemed certain that it received enough milk. The reason that the young animal wasted away so quickly is not known."

A male polar bear cub named Rasputin was relocated from Moscow to the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2008 for what was thought to be an extended stay before his permanent move to the <a href="Zoo%20Aquarium%20de%20Madrid">Zoo Aquarium de Madrid</a>. Originally meant to remain in Germany for only a year, the male bear—called "Raspi" by fans—shared Flocke's enclosure. The zoo hoped that Rasputin, who unlike Flocke was raised by his mother, would teach their celebrity bear how to interact with those of her own species. According to a statement given by the city, the bears "get along famously".

On 21 October 2009, the city of Nuremberg announced that Flocke and Rasputin would move together to a newly constructed enclosure at <a href="Marineland%20%28Antibes%29">Marineland</a>, located in <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a>, France, at the beginning of 2010. Due to the close relationship between the two adolescent bears, officials from the European Conservation Breeding Program (Europäischen Erhaltungszucht-Programms, or "EEP") decided that the two bears should remain together despite earlier plans for Rasputin to relocate to Madrid alone. The enclosure they are vacating in Nuremberg will be utilized by Flocke's parents, Vera and Felix, in the hopes that they will produce more cubs. Despite last minute efforts by the animal right's group <a href="PETA">PETA</a> to halt the move based on concerns for Flocke and Rasputin's well-being, the two bears arrived safely in France on 22 April 2010. On 26 November 2014, Flocke gave birth to her own cub named Hope, fathered by Rasputin.

Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy

The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy (sometimes called the Kentucky Tragedy) was the murder of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> legislator <a href="Solomon%20P.%20Sharp">Solomon P. Sharp</a> by <a href="Jereboam%20O.%20Beauchamp">Jereboam O. Beauchamp</a> (bee-chum). As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an <a href="Illegitimacy">illegitimate child</a> with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied paternity of the <a href="Stillbirth">stillborn</a> child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>.

An investigation soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, and he was apprehended at his home in <a href="Glasgow%2C%20Kentucky">Glasgow</a>, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by <a href="hanging">hanging</a>. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double <a href="suicide">suicide</a> by drinking <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.

While Beauchamp's primary motive in killing Sharp was to defend the honor of his wife, speculation raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was a leader of the New Court party during the <a href="Old%20Court%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court – New Court controversy</a> in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a>, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe's</a> unfinished "<a href="Politian%20%28play%29">Politian</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Penn%20Warren">Robert Penn Warren</a>'s "World Enough and Time" (1950).

Jereboam Beauchamp was born in <a href="Barren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Barren County, Kentucky</a>, in 1802. Educated in the school of Dr. Benjamin Thurston, he resolved to study law at age eighteen. While observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a>, Beauchamp was particularly impressed with the abilities of Solomon P. Sharp. Sharp had twice been elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a> and had served two terms in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when, in 1820, a planter's daughter named Anna Cooke claimed Sharp was the father of her child, who was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her mother's plantation outside Bowling Green.
Beauchamp's father lived a mile (1.6 km) from Cooke's estate, and the young man wanted to meet her. Beauchamp gradually gained Cooke's trust by visiting under the guise of borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a courtship. Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.

The preferred method of <a href="honor%20killing">honor killing</a> in that day was a <a href="duel">duel</a>. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp would not accept a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">state's attorney general</a> by <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, only to find that Sharp was not there and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.

Cooke resolved to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she sent a letter to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.

Although Beauchamp had not completed the task she set him, Cooke married the younger man in mid-June 1824. Beauchamp immediately hatched another plot to kill Sharp. He began sending letters – each from a different post office and signed with a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> – requesting Sharp's assistance in settling a land claim and asking when he would again be in <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green River</a> country. Sharp finally answered Beauchamp's last letter – mailed in June 1825 – but gave no date for his arrival.

Serving as attorney general in <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> Adair's administration, Sharp had become involved in the Old Court – New Court controversy. The conflict was primarily between debtors who sought relief from their financial burdens after the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> (the New Court, or Relief, faction) and the creditors to whom these obligations were owed (the Old Court, or Anti-Relief, faction). Sharp, who came from humble beginnings, sided with the New Court. By 1825, the New Court faction's power was on the decline. In an attempt to bolster the party's influence, Sharp resigned as attorney general in 1825 to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. His opponent was Old Court stalwart <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>.

During the campaign, Old Court supporters again raised the issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child on the grounds that it was a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.

Word of Sharp's alleged claims soon reached Jereboam Beauchamp, reviving his resolve to kill him. Beauchamp abandoned the idea of killing Sharp honorably in a duel. Instead, he decided to murder him and cast suspicion on his political enemies. To add to the intrigue, Beauchamp plotted to commit the murder on the eve of the General Assembly's opening session.

Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, reaching it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at the local inns, he rented a room in the private residence of Joel Scott, <a href="Corrections%20officer">warden</a> of the state <a href="Prison">penitentiary</a>. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a>, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.

Beauchamp approached the house at approximately two o'clock in the morning on November 7, 1825. In his "Confession", he described the encounter:

The wound severed Sharp's <a href="aorta">aorta</a>, killing him almost instantly. Sharp's wife Eliza witnessed the entire scene from the top of the stairs in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured. Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River. In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.

After learning of the murder, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> authorized the <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor</a> to offer a reward of $3,000 for the arrest and conviction of Sharp's killer. The trustees of the city of <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> added a reward of $1,000, and friends of Sharp raised an additional $2,000 reward. Suspicion for the killing rested on three men: Beauchamp, Waring, and Patrick H. Darby. During Sharp's 1824 campaign for a seat in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>, Darby had remarked that, should Sharp be elected, "he would never take his seat and would be as good as a dead man". Waring had made similar threats, boasting that he had already stabbed six men.

A <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrant</a> was sworn out for Waring's arrest, but officials soon learned that he was incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to <a href="Simpson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Simpson County</a> where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told Darby that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished Darby with a letter that contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.

The first night following the murder, Beauchamp stayed at the home of a relative in <a href="Bloomfield%2C%20Kentucky">Bloomfield</a>. The next day, he traveled to <a href="Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky">Bardstown</a>, where he spent the night. He lodged with his brother-in-law in <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a> on the night of November 9 before returning to his home in Glasgow on November 10. He and Anna had planned to flee to <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, but before nightfall, a posse had arrived from Frankfort to arrest him.

He was taken to Frankfort and tried before an examining court, but <a href="Commonwealth%27s%20Attorney">Commonwealth's Attorney</a> Charles S. Bibb said that he had not yet collected enough evidence to detain him. Beauchamp was released, but agreed to stay in Frankfort for ten days to allow the court to finish its investigation. During this time, Beauchamp wrote letters to John J. Crittenden and <a href="George%20M.%20Bibb">George M. Bibb</a> requesting their legal aid in the matter. Neither letter was answered. Meanwhile, Beauchamp's uncle, a state senator, gathered a defense team that included former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="John%20Pope%20%28politician%29">John Pope</a>.

During the investigation, unsuccessful attempts were made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.

When questioned, Patrick Darby testified that in 1824, Beauchamp had solicited his services in order to bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, even if he had to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the <a href="circuit%20court">circuit court</a>'s next term, which began in March 1826.

Beauchamp was <a href="indictment">indicted</a>, and his trial began May 8, 1826. Beauchamp pleaded not guilty, but never testified during the trial. Captain Lowe was called to repeat the story he had originally related to Patrick Darby regarding Beauchamp's threats to kill Sharp. He further testified that Beauchamp returned home following the murder waving a red flag and declaring that he had "gained the victory." He also turned over to the court a letter from the Beauchamps regarding the murder. In the letter, Beauchamp maintained his innocence, but told Lowe that his enemies were plotting against him and asked him to testify in his behalf. The letter gave Lowe several talking points to mention if called to testify, some true and some otherwise.
Eliza Sharp repeated her assertion that the murderer's voice was that of Beauchamp. Joel Scott, the warden who gave Beauchamp lodging the night of the murder, testified that he heard Beauchamp leave during the night and return later that night. He also mentioned that Beauchamp was extremely inquisitive about the crime upon being told of it the next morning. The most extensive testimony came from Darby, who recounted his 1824 meeting with Beauchamp. According to Darby, Beauchamp claimed that Sharp offered him and Anna $1,000, a slave girl, and of land if they would leave him alone. Sharp later reneged on the offer.

Some witnesses maintained that the killer's claim to be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.

Beauchamp's defense team attempted to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing his association with the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.

During closing arguments, defense counsel John Pope attempted to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, and despite the absence of any <a href="physical%20evidence">physical evidence</a>, including a murder weapon, the <a href="jury">jury</a> returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by <a href="hanging">hanging</a> on June 16, 1826.

During the trial, Anna Beauchamp appealed to John Waring for help on her husband's behalf. She also tried to entice John Lowe to commit <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and testify on her husband's behalf. Both appeals were denied. On May 20, Anna was examined by two <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justices of the peace</a> on suspicion of being an <a href="Accessory%20%28legal%20term%29">accessory</a> to the murder, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. At her request, Anna was permitted to stay in the cell with Beauchamp .

Pope's request to have the verdict overturned was denied, but the judge granted Beauchamp a <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a> until July 7 to allow him to produce a written justification of his actions. In it, Beauchamp said he had killed Sharp to defend Anna's honor. Beauchamp had hoped to publish his work before his execution, but the <a href="libel">libel</a>ous charges it contained – that prosecution witnesses committed perjury and <a href="bribery">bribery</a> to see him convicted – delayed its publication.

The Beauchamps were accused of trying to bribe a guard to let them escape, but this effort failed. They also tried to get a letter to Senator Beauchamp, asking for his help in escaping. A final plea to Governor Desha for another stay of execution was denied on July 5. Later that day, the couple attempted a double <a href="suicide">suicide</a> by taking large doses of <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a>, but both survived.
On July 7, the morning of Beauchamp's scheduled execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while she dressed. Anna tried another overdose on laudanum, but was unable to keep it down. She had smuggled a knife into the cell, and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it. When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home and tended to by doctors.

Weakened by his own wounds, Beauchamp was loaded on a cart to be taken to the <a href="gallows">gallows</a> and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not severely injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse. He kissed her lifeless lips and declared "For you I lived — for you I die."

On his way to the gallows, Beauchamp asked to see Patrick Darby, who was among the assembled spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.

At the gallows, Beauchamp assured the assembled <a href="clergy">clergy</a> that he had a <a href="salvation">salvation</a> experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played "Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow" while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in <a href="Bloomfield%2C%20Kentucky">Bloomfield, Kentucky</a>. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.

Beauchamp's confession was published in 1826, the same year as "The Letters of Ann Cook" – the authorship of which is disputed. J. G. Dana and R. S. Thomas also published an edited transcript of Beauchamp's trial. The following year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote "Vindication of the character of the late Col. Solomon P. Sharp" to defend Sharp from the charges made in Beauchamp's confession. Patrick Darby threatened to sue Dr. Sharp if the work were published. John Waring threatened Dr. Sharp's life if he published "Vindication". All copies of the work were left in the Sharps' home in Frankfort, where they were discovered many years later during a remodel.

Though many regarded Sharp's murder as an honor killing, some New Court partisans charged that Beauchamp had been incited to violence by members of the Old Court party, specifically Patrick Darby. Sharp was thought to be the minority party's choice for Speaker of the House for the 1826 session. By enticing Beauchamp to murder Sharp, the Old Court could remove a political enemy. Sharp's widow Eliza appeared to believe this notion. In an 1826 letter in the "New Court Argus of Western America", she referred to Darby as "the chief instigator of the foul murder which has deprived me of all my heart held most dear on earth".

Some Old Court partisans claimed that Governor Desha had offered Beauchamp a <a href="clemency">pardon</a> if he would implicate Darby and Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, in his confession. Shortly before his execution, Beauchamp was heard to say he had "been New Court long enough, and would die an Old Court man." Beauchamp had steadfastly identified with the Old Court, and his claim seems to imply that he had at least considered colluding with the New Court powers to secure his pardon. Such a deal is explicitly mentioned in one version of Beauchamp's "Confession". Beauchamp ultimately rejected the deal for fear that he would be double-crossed by the New Court, leaving him imprisoned and deprived of the <a href="chivalry">chivalrous</a> motive for his actions.

Darby denied involvement with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as <a href="Francis%20P.%20Blair">Francis P. Blair</a> and <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a> were seeking to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the "New Court Argus" was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims between the two sides reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the "New Court Argus" suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.

Darby eventually brought suit for libel against Kendall and Eliza Sharp, as well as Senator Beauchamp and Sharp's brother Leander. Numerous delays and <a href="change%20of%20venue">changes of venue</a> prevented any of the suits from ever going to trial. Darby died in December 1829.

The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works, notably <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe's</a> unfinished play "<a href="Politian%20%28play%29">Politian</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Penn%20Warren">Robert Penn Warren</a>'s "World Enough and Time". <a href="William%20Gilmore%20Simms">William Gilmore Simms</a> wrote three works based on the Sharp's murder and aftermath: "Beauchampe: or The Kentucky Tragedy, A Tale of Passion", "Charlemont", and "Beauchampe: A Sequel to Charlemonte". "Greyslaer: A Romance of the Mohawk" by <a href="Charles%20Fenno%20Hoffman">Charles Fenno Hoffman</a>, "Octavia Bragaldi" by <a href="Charlotte%20Mary%20Sanford%20Barnes">Charlotte Barnes</a>, "Sybil" by John Savage, and "Conrad and Eudora; or, The Death of Alonzo: A Tragedy" and "Leoni, The Orphan of Venice" both by <a href="Thomas%20Holley%20Chivers">Thomas Holley Chivers</a>, all draw to some degree on the events that surround Sharp's murder.


Sources variously give the name as Anna Cooke, Anna Cook, Ann Cooke, and Ann Cook.

Gather Together in My Name

Gather Together in My Name (1974) is a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> by American writer and poet <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>. It is the second book in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The book begins immediately following the events described in "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>", and follows Angelou, called Rita, from the ages of 17 to 19. Written three years after "Caged Bird", the book "depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime." The title of the book is taken from the Bible, but it also conveys how one black female lived in the white-dominated society of the U.S. following the Second World War.

Angelou expands upon many themes that she started discussing in her first autobiography, including motherhood and family, racism, identity, education and literacy. Rita becomes closer to her mother in this book, and goes through a variety of jobs and relationships as she tries to provide for her young son and find her place in the world. Angelou continues to discuss racism in "Gather Together", but moves from speaking for all Black women to describing how one young woman dealt with it. The book exhibits the <a href="narcissism">narcissism</a> of young people, but describes how Rita discovers her identity. Like many of Angelou's autobiographies, "Gather Together" is concerned with Angelou's on-going self-education.

"Gather Together" was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou's first autobiography, but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as being better written than its predecessor. The book's structure, consisting of a series of episodes tied together by theme and content, parallels the chaos of adolescence, which some critics feel makes it an unsatisfactory sequel to "Caged Bird". Rita's many physical movements throughout the book, which affects the book's organization and quality, has caused at least one critic to call it a <a href="Travel%20literature">travel narrative</a>.

"Gather Together in My Name", published in 1974, is <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s second book in her series of seven autobiographies. Written three years after her first autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>", the book "depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime". In 1971, Angelou published her first volume of poetry, "<a href="Just%20Give%20Me%20a%20Cool%20Drink%20of%20Water%20%27fore%20I%20Diiie">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie</a>" (1971), which became a bestseller and was nominated for a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. It was Angelou's early practice to alternate a prose volume with a poetry volume. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at the inauguration of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy's</a> inauguration in 1961. Through the writing of this autobiography and her life stories in all of her books, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. According to scholar Joanne Braxton, it made her "without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".

The title of "Gather Together" is inspired by Matthew 18:19-20: "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (<a href="King%20James%20version">King James version</a>). While Angelou acknowledged the title's biblical origin, she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts. Scholar Sondra O'Neale states that the title is "a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while waiting patiently for deliverance".

Critic <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> believes that the title of this book may have an additional significance. A prevailing theme in "Gather Together" is how one Black female was able to survive in the wider context of post-war America, but it also speaks for all Black women, and how they came to survive in a white-dominated society. Critic <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> agrees: "The incidents in the book appear merely gathered together in the name of Maya Angelou".

The book opens in the years following World War II. Angelou, still known as "Marguerite," or "Rita," has just given birth to her son Clyde, and is living with her mother and stepfather in San Francisco. The book follows Marguerite from the ages of 17 to 19, through a series of relationships, occupations, and cities as she attempts to raise her son and to find her place in the world. It continues exploring the themes of Angelou's isolation and loneliness begun in her first volume, and the ways she overcomes racism, sexism, and her continued victimization.

Rita goes from job to job and from relationship to relationship, hoping that "my charming prince was going to appear out of the blue". "My fantasies were little different than any other girl of my age", Angelou wrote. "He would come. He would. Just walk into my life, see me and fall everlastingly in love ... I looked forward to a husband who would love me ethereally, spiritually, and on rare (but beautiful) occasions, physically".

Some important events occur throughout the book while Rita tries to care for herself and her son. In <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, Rita becomes an absentee manager for two lesbian prostitutes. When threatened with incarceration and with losing her son for her illegal activities, she and Clyde escape to her grandmother's home in <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps, Arkansas</a>. Her grandmother sends them to San Francisco for their safety and protection after physically punishing Rita for confronting two white women in a department store. This event demonstrates their different and irreconcilable attitudes about race, paralleling events in Angelou's first book. Back with her mother in San Francisco, Rita attempts to enlist in the Army, only to be rejected during the height of the <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> because she had attended the <a href="California%20Labor%20School">California Labor School</a> as a young teenager.

Another event of note described in the book was, in spite of "the strangest audition", her short stint dancing and studying dance with her partner, R. L. Poole, who became her lover until he reunited with his previous partner, ending Rita's show business career for the time being.

A turning point in the book occurs when Rita falls in love with a gambler named L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and introduces her to prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita to her mother's home. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for him, she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from Tolbrook, who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to <a href="Bakersfield%2C%20California">Bakersfield, California</a>, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I began to understand that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would I think of him as a beautiful appendage of myself".

The end of the book finds Rita defeated by life: "For the first time I sat down defenseless to await life's next assault". The book ends with an encounter with a drug addict who cared enough for her to show her the effects of his drug habit, which galvanizes her to reject drug addiction and to make something of her life for her and her son.

Beginning in "Gather Together", motherhood and family issues are important themes throughout Angelou's autobiographies. The book describes the change and the importance of Rita's relationship with her own mother, the woman who had abandoned her and her brother as children, demonstrated by Rita's return to her mother at the end of the book, "after she realizes how close to the edge she has come, as a woman and as a mother". Vivian Baxter cares for Rita's young son as Rita attempts to make a living. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that "one gets a strong sense throughout "Gather Together" of [Rita's] dependence on her mother". Critic Lyman B. Hagen remarks that Angelou's relationship with her mother becomes more important in "Gather Together", and that Vivian is now more influential in the development of Angelou's attitudes. Lupton calls Clyde's kidnapping a "powerful sequence of mother-loss" and connects it to the kidnapping of Clyde's son in the 1980s. Angelou has compared the production of this book to giving birth, an apt metaphor given the birth of her son at the end of "Caged Bird". Like many authors, Angelou views the creative writing process and its results as her children.

Angelou's goal, beginning with her first autobiography, was to "tell the truth about the lives of black women", but her goal evolved, in her later volumes, to document the ups and downs of her own life. Angelou's autobiographies have the same structure: they give a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time, how she coped within the context of a larger white society, and the ways that her story played out within that context. Critic Selwyn Cudjoe stated that in "Gather Together", Angelou is still concerned with the questions of what it means to be a Black female in the US, but focuses upon herself at a certain point in history, in the years immediately following World War II. The book begins with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African-American community during that time, which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character's life. According to McPherson, African Americans were promised a new racial order that did not materialize.

Halfway through "Gather Together", an incident occurs that demonstrates the different ways in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism. Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior was dangerous. Rita's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.

Angelou's autobiographies, including this volume, have been used in <a href="narrative">narrative</a> and multicultural approaches in <a href="teacher%20education">teacher education</a>. Dr. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>, has used "Caged Bird" and "Gather Together" to train teachers how to discuss race in their classrooms. According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony, readers of "Gather Together" and the rest of Angelou's autobiographies cause readers to wonder what she left out and unsure about how to respond to the events Angelou describes. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the <a href="genre">genre</a> of African American autobiography and on her <a href="literary%20techniques">literary techniques</a>, readers react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".

"Gather Together" retains the freshness of "Caged Bird," but has a self-consciousness absent from the first volume. Author <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> states that Angelou "replaces the language of social history with the language of therapy". The book exhibits the <a href="narcissism">narcissism</a> and self-involvement of young adults. It is Rita who is the focus, and all other characters are secondary, and they are often presented "with the deft superficiality of a stage description" who pay the price for Rita's self-involvement. Much of Angelou's writing in this volume, as Als states, is "reactive, not reflective". Angelou chooses to demonstrate Rita's narcissism in "Gather Together" by dropping the conventional forms of autobiography, which has a beginning, middle, and end. For example, there is no central experience in her second volume, as there is in "Caged Bird" with Angelou's account of her rape at the age of eight. Lupton believes that this central experience is relocated "to some luminous place in a volume yet to be".

"Gather Together", like much of African-American literature, depicts Rita's search for self-discovery, identity, and dignity in the difficult environment of racism, and how she, like other African Americans, were able to rise above it. Rita's search is expressed both outwardly, through her material needs, and inwardly, through love and family relationships. In "Caged Bird", despite trauma and parental rejection, Rita's world is relatively secure, but the adolescent young woman in "Gather Together" experiences the dissolution of her relationships many times. The loneliness that ensues for her is "a loneliness that becomes, at times, suicidal and contributes to her unanchored self". Rita is unsure of who she is or what she would become, so she tries several roles in a restless and frustrated way, as adolescents often do during this period of their lives. Her experimentation was part of her self-education that would successfully bring her into maturity and adulthood. Lupton agrees, stating that Rita survived through trial and error while defining herself as a Black woman. Angelou recognizes that the mistakes she depicts are part of "the fumblings of youth and to be forgiven as such", but young Rita insists that she take responsibility for herself and her child.

<a href="Feminist">Feminist</a> scholar Maria Lauret states that the formation of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in "Gather Together", especially her demonstration of the "racist habit" of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with what it means to be Black and female in America, but she now describes "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and "tell the truth as a writer". Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing "Caged Bird", because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs ... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".

All of Angelou's autobiographies, especially this volume and its predecessor, is "very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century. Like writers such as <a href="Claude%20McKay">Claude McKay</a>, <a href="Langston%20Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>, and <a href="James%20Baldwin%20%28writer%29">James Baldwin</a>, Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". She did not feel that her education ended at high school, however. As Hagen points out, since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child, she continues to read, exposing herself to a wide variety of authors, ranging from <a href="Countee%20Cullen">Countee Cullen</a>'s poetry to <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> and other <a href="Russian%20literature">Russian authors</a>. She states, during her stint as a madame, "when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit, I discovered the Russian writers".

"Gather Together in My Name" was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou's first autobiography, but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as better written. "<a href="Atlantic%20Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a>'s" reviewer said that the book was "excellently written". and "<a href="Choice%20Magazine">Choice Magazine</a>" called Angelou a "fine story teller". Cudjoe calls the book "neither politically nor linguistically innocent". Although Cudjoe finds "Gather Together" a weaker autobiography compared to "Caged Bird", he states that Angelou's use of language is "the work's saving grace", and that it contains "a much more consistent and sustained flow of eloquent and honey-dipped writing".

Lupton feels that the tight structure of "Caged Bird" seems to crumble in "Gather Together". Angelou's "childhood experiences were replaced by episodes that a number of critics consider disjointed or bizarre"; Lupton's explanation was that Angelou's later works consist of episodes, or fragments, that are "reflections of the kind of chaos found in actual living". Cudjoe thought this convention is what weakened the book's structure, stating that the events described prevented it from achieving a "complex level of significance". Lupton states, "In altering the narrative structure, Angelou shifts the emphasis from herself as an isolated consciousness to herself as a Black woman participating in diverse experiences among a diverse class of peoples". There are similarities in the structure of both books, however. Like "Caged Bird", "Gather Together" consists of a series of interrelated episodes, and both books also start with a poetic preface.

Cudjoe has noted that "Gather Together" lacks the "intense solidity and moral center" found in "Caged Bird", and that the strong ethics of the Black community in the rural South is replaced by the alienation and fragmentation of urban life in the first half of the twentieth century. The world that Angelou introduces her readers to in "Gather Together" leaves her protagonist without a sense of purpose, and as Cudjoe states, "to the brink of destruction in order to realize herself". Critic Lyman B. Hagen disagrees with Cudjoe's judgment that Angelou's second autobiography lacked a moral center, saying that even though there are many unsavory characters in the book and that their lifestyles are not condemned, the innocent Rita emerges triumphant and "evil does not prevail". Rita moves through a sleazy world with good intentions and grows stronger as a result of her exposure to it. Hagen states that if were not for "Gather Together's" complex literary style, its content would prevent it from being accepted as "an exemplary literary effort".

Although "Caged Bird" was refreshing in its honesty, something its readers and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in "Gather Together" had become, as reviewer <a href="John%20McWhorter">John McWhorter</a> perceives it, "more and more formulaic". McWhorter asserts that the events that Angelou describes in "Gather Together" and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them on face value. In "Gather Together", for example, Angelou insists that she is not religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though she was afraid of becoming a lesbian in "Caged Bird" and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in "Gather Together", and for not explaining them fully, and states, "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".

Rita's many physical movements throughout the book causes Hagen to call it a travel narrative. According to Lupton, this movement also affects the book's organization and quality, making it a less satisfactory sequel to "Caged Bird". Angelou has responded to this criticism by stating that she attempted to capture "the episodic, erratic nature of adolescence" as she experienced this period in her life. McPherson agreed, states that "Gather Together's" structure is more complex than "Caged Bird". Angelou's style in "Gather Together" is more mature and simplified, which allows her to better convey emotion and insight through, as McPherson described it, "sharp and vivid word images".

The game was the final contest of the <a href="2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2005 football season</a> for each team and resulted in a 35–24 Virginia Tech victory. Virginia Tech represented the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC), and Louisville represented the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a> (Big East) in the competition.

Louisville was selected as a participant in the 2006 Gator Bowl following a 9–2 regular season of their first year in the Big East Conference. Louisville won its last five games before the Gator Bowl and participated in the <a href="Liberty%20Bowl">Liberty Bowl</a> at the end of the previous season. Facing the 15th-ranked Cardinals, were the 12th-ranked Hokies. Virginia Tech finished 10–2 <a href="Season%20%28sports%29">regular season</a>, and included wins over 15th-ranked <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a> and traditional rivals <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football">Virginia</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football">West Virginia</a>. A loss to <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football">Florida State</a> in the <a href="2005%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">inaugural ACC Championship Game</a> gave Tech a position in the Gator Bowl instead of the more prestigious <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a>-run <a href="2006%20Orange%20Bowl">Orange Bowl</a> game. Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Louisville's loss of star <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Brian%20Brohm">Brian Brohm</a> to injury, Virginia Tech's fall from being a contender for the national championship, the fact that both teams were playing under new conference affiliations, and the rise of Virginia Tech quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a>, younger brother of NFL star <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>.

The 2006 Gator Bowl began on January 2, 2006, at 12:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> in Jacksonville. Louisville led for much of the game, beginning with an 11-yard <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> <a href="forward%20pass">pass</a> in the first quarter by backup quarterback <a href="Hunter%20Cantwell">Hunter Cantwell</a>, who filled in for the injured Brohm. Tech's offense replied with a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>, but Louisville was able to add another touchdown before the end of the quarter, extending its lead to 14–3. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech fought back and narrowed Louisville's lead to a single touchdown. At halftime, the score was 17–10 in Louisville's favor. In the second half, Virginia Tech's offense began to have success. Tech earned the only points of the third quarter—a 28-yard field goal from kicker Brandon Pace—to narrow Louisville's lead to 17–13. In the fourth quarter, the game fully turned in the Hokies' favor. Though Louisville scored a touchdown early in the quarter, Virginia Tech scored 22 unanswered points in the final 13 minutes of the game to take a 35–24 lead and earn the win.

<a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">Tailback</a> <a href="Cedric%20Humes">Cedric Humes</a> was named the <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a> of the game for Virginia Tech, and quarterback Hunter Cantwell was named the Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech <a href="Punter%20%28American%20football%29">punter</a> Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl records for <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a> yardage and average punt distance, kicking the ball six times for 300 yards, an average of 50 yards per kick. Virginia Tech's win was marred by excessive penalties and unsportsmanlike conduct that resulted in the ejection of one player. Following the game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team as a result of several incidents of misconduct, including a stomp on Louisville defender <a href="Elvis%20Dumervil">Elvis Dumervil</a>'s leg during the game. Several players who participated in the game, including Dumervil, later went on to careers in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>.

In the <a href="2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2005 college football season</a>, the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> had an <a href="Automatic%20bids%20to%20non-BCS%20bowls">automatic bid</a> to the Gator Bowl. By contract, the Gator Bowl Association—which produces the game—possessed the first pick of <a href="bowl%20eligible">bowl-eligible</a> ACC teams after the winner of the <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> was given a spot in a <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) game. This was the final year that the Gator Bowl had first pick of eligible ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in the Gator Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the <a href="2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2006 college football season</a>. Virginia Tech, losers of the <a href="2005%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2005 ACC Championship Game</a>, were chosen by the Gator Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to the 2006 Gator Bowl.

The other half of the matchup would consist of either <a href="Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football">Notre Dame</a> or the first selection from the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a> after that conference's automatic BCS bid. Because Notre Dame was selected to play in the <a href="2006%20Fiesta%20Bowl">2006 Fiesta Bowl</a>, a BCS game, the Gator Bowl Association was required to select the Big East's Louisville Cardinals, which, like Virginia Tech, finished second in their conference.

The Louisville Cardinals football team came into the 2005 season having gone 11–1 the previous season, including a season-ending 44–40 victory over <a href="Boise%20State%20Broncos%20football">Boise State</a> in the <a href="Liberty%20Bowl">2004 Liberty Bowl</a>. In addition, Louisville was also entering a new conference—the Big East—after departing <a href="Conference%20USA">Conference USA</a> following the end of the 2004 season. In a poll of media members covering the Big East prior to the 2005 season, Louisville was predicted to win the Big East championship its first year in the conference.

In their first and second games of the season, the Cardinals lived up to that expectation. At in-state rival <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20football">Kentucky</a>, Louisville earned a 31–24 victory to win the <a href="Kentucky%E2%80%93Louisville%20rivalry">Governor's Cup</a>. This was followed the next week by a 63–27 victory over non-conference opponent <a href="Oregon%20State%20Beavers%20football">Oregon State</a>. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, their first Big East conference game of the season—and of school history—did not go as well. At <a href="South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football">South Florida</a>, the ninth-ranked Cardinals were outscored 45–14, the first time in 13 games Louisville's offense was held to less than 30 points.

Following the loss, Louisville recovered, scoring 61 points and 69 points, respectively, in non-conference wins over <a href="Florida%20Atlantic%20University">Florida Atlantic University</a> and <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football">North Carolina</a>, returning to their previous offensive success. Again, however, Louisville faltered against a Big East opponent. The Cardinals' second Big East game, at <a href="West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football">West Virginia University</a>, was another Louisville loss, 46–44. West Virginia later went on to finish 11–1 for the season, winning the Big East championship and defeating the Georgia Bulldogs in the <a href="2006%20Sugar%20Bowl">2006 Sugar Bowl</a>.

Louisville, meanwhile, returned to its winning ways. The Cardinals, following their loss to the Mountaineers, won their first Big East game in school history the next week, over the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football">Cincinnati Bearcats</a>, 46–22. The rout of Cincinnati sparked a five-game winning streak, which concluded on December 3 with a 30–20 victory over the <a href="Connecticut%20Huskies">University of Connecticut Huskies</a>. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, starting <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Brian%20Brohm">Brian Brohm</a>, who had the sixth-best season (in terms of passing yards) in Louisville history, suffered a season-ending knee injury. With West Virginia having won the Big East championship and an automatic Bowl Championship Series game bid, Big East second-place Louisville was selected by the Gator Bowl even before the victory over Connecticut.

The Virginia Tech Hokies football team began the 2005 college football season as reigning Atlantic Coast Conference football champions. The Hokies also played in the <a href="2005%20Sugar%20Bowl">2005 Sugar Bowl</a> against the third-ranked <a href="2004%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team">Auburn Tigers</a>, losing 16–13 in a close contest. Expectations were high for the Hokies to repeat their ACC championship performance the next year, and a preseason poll of media covering ACC football resulted in Virginia Tech being picked to face Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game.

In its first game of the season, however, eighth-ranked Virginia Tech almost let those expectations fall short. At <a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20Wolfpack%20football">North Carolina State</a>, the Hokies trailed at halftime and were tied at the beginning of the fourth quarter before eking out a 20–16 win in the final minutes. The Hokies bounced back from the close contest in their second game of the season—against the <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football">Duke Blue Devils</a>—as Tech raced to a 45–0 victory. The Hokies held Duke to just 35 yards of total offense, Tech's best defensive performance in the modern era.

The win over Duke was followed by several others in succession. Heading into their ninth game of the season, the Hokies were 8–0 record and the third-ranked college football team in the country. Against the fifth-ranked <a href="2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami Hurricanes</a>, however, Virginia Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, falling 27–7. Tech recovered by winning its next two games, earning a spot in the inaugural Atlantic Coast Conference Championship Game, held in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. There, the Hokies lost, 27–22, to the <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles">Florida State Seminoles</a>. The Seminoles earned an automatic bid to a <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> game by virtue of the victory—had Virginia Tech won the game, it would have been awarded the bid. The day after Tech lost the ACC Championship Game, the Gator Bowl extended a formal invitation to Virginia Tech, which the Hokies accepted. Ninth-ranked Miami, the same team that beat the Hokies 27–7 earlier in the season, was considered for selection, but the Gator Bowl Association took into consideration Virginia Tech's history of having a large fan base travel to its bowl games, and selected the Hokies on those grounds.

Pregame media and fan interest surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's <a href="Hunter%20Cantwell">Hunter Cantwell</a>, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a>, brother of <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> star <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>. Also a concern for Louisville was the health of star <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Michael%20Bush">Michael Bush</a>, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, there was also the hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and in the hunt for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.

When betting on the game opened, <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Virginia Tech by 10 points. Five days after betting opened, the point spread narrowed to 7.5, still in favor of Virginia Tech. Two weeks later, the point spread remained at 7.5 in favor of Virginia Tech.

Heading into the Gator Bowl, Louisville's scoring offense was ranked third in the country—averaging 45.2 points per game—and was held under 30 points just once in their preceding 21 games. The high-powered Cardinals' offense was predicted to pose a challenge for the Virginia Tech defense.

With star quarterback Brian Brohm having undergone surgery to repair a torn <a href="anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">anterior cruciate ligament</a>, there were some questions as to how backup Hunter Cantwell would perform under pressure. Cantwell played well in the Cardinals' season-ending contest against Connecticut, but some commentators predicted that Virginia Tech's quicker defense would pose problems for him. In that contest, Cantwell completed 16 of 25 passes for 271 yards and a touchdown. In <a href="Paducah%20Tilghman%20High%20School">high school</a>, Cantwell passed for 7,272 yards and 70 touchdowns. His .606 career completion percentage ranked 11th in <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> state history.

Running back Michael Bush was predicted to return to form after suffering a foot injury that kept him out of two games in November. Bush ran for 121 yards and three touchdowns against Connecticut, his first game back from the injury. Heading into the Gator Bowl, Bush earned a school-record 24 touchdowns and led the country in scoring. He ran for 1,049 yards in nine games. He was also a capable receiver, catching 20 passes for 245 yards and a touchdown. But with Brohm on the sidelines, it was expected the Cardinals would rely on Bush's legs more than usual, in an effort to minimize the need for the inexperienced Cantwell to pass the ball.

Louisville <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> <a href="Mario%20Urrutia">Mario Urrutia</a>, who caught 31 passes for 702 yards and six touchdowns during the regular season, stirred a bit of controversy in the final days leading up to the Gator Bowl after he declared that Virginia Tech's first-ranked defense was "mostly hype".

Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was considered the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl. The younger brother of first-overall <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a> pick Michael Vick—who also played for Tech—Marcus led the league in passing efficiency (141.6 rating), completed 166 of 268 passes (60.3 percent) for 2,190 yards and 15 touchdowns, with ten interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 370 yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft. "The NFL is tough. It's the real deal. You've got to be ready for it. You just don't want to rush into just throwing yourself out there because of the money or anything like that. You've got to really be prepared for it", he said.

On the ground, two different Tech players were predicted to share time running the ball. Senior running back Cedric Humes was predicted to get the bulk of the carries in the game, but <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> freshman Branden Ore was also predicted to see some plays at times. Humes rushed the ball 140 times for 639 yards and ten touchdowns during the regular season. Ore, meanwhile, ran the ball for 591 yards and six touchdowns.

Wide receiver <a href="Josh%20Morgan">Josh Morgan</a> was also considered a key component of the Hokie offense. Morgan finished the season with 28 receptions for 471 yards and four touchdowns. Prior to the game, Morgan predicted that if the Hokies executed their plays well, they would emerge the victors.

Backup <a href="Guard%20%28American%20football%29">guard</a> Brandon Gore broke his ankle during the Hokies' loss to Florida State and would not be able to participate. Senior Tech running back <a href="Mike%20Imoh">Mike Imoh</a>, who shared time running the ball during the regular season with Ore and Humes, was also out after undergoing surgery to repair an injured ankle. Adding to the injury situation for Virginia Tech was <a href="offensive%20tackle">offensive tackle</a> Jimmy Martin, who suffered a sprained knee ligament in practice leading up to the game. Martin started 45 consecutive games prior to the Gator Bowl, a streak that was broken when he was replaced by <a href="Brandon%20Frye">Brandon Frye</a> on the day of the game.

Shortly after Louisville was selected to the 2006 Gator Bowl, Cardinals <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Elvis%20Dumervil">Elvis Dumervil</a> was awarded the <a href="Bronko%20Nagurski%20Trophy">Bronko Nagurski Trophy</a>, given annually to the top defensive college football player in the United States. Dumervil also earned several other honors in the weeks leading up to the game, including being named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, an <a href="All-America">Associated Press All-American</a> and earning the <a href="Ted%20Hendricks%20Award">Ted Hendricks Award</a>, given annually to the best defensive end in the country. Dumervil led the nation in sacks (20) and forced fumbles (10) during the regular season. Prior to the game, he announced that he was looking forward to the contest, saying, "To me, I wanted to play the best possible team in the Gator Bowl, and I think that's what we've got".

A week and a half after Dumervil won the Nagurski Trophy, senior <a href="defensive%20tackle">defensive tackle</a> <a href="Montavious%20Stanley">Montavious Stanley</a>, who was a leader on defense for Louisville, underwent surgery to repair a torn <a href="Pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral muscle</a>. Stanley was the Cardinals' best run-stopper on defense, amassing 48 tackles and 5.5 <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacks</a> during the season.

Coming into the Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech defense was ranked first in total defense, second in pass defense, fourth in rushing defense, and third in scoring defense, allowing an average of just over 12 points per game. The Virginia Tech defense was led by defensive end <a href="Darryl%20Tapp">Darryl Tapp</a>, a first-team All-ACC pick, an <a href="American%20Football%20Coaches%20Association">American Football Coaches Association</a> (AFCA) All-American, a finalist for the <a href="Lott%20Trophy">Lott Trophy</a>, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader both on and off the field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45 tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks. He was also named a second-team <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> All-American, and he won the Dudley Award, given annually to the best college football player in the state of Virginia.

Tech cornerback <a href="Jimmy%20F.%20Williams">Jimmy F. Williams</a>, considered a cornerstone of the Hokie defense, was a finalist for the Nagurski Trophy that season, but lost to Louisville's Elvis Dumervil. Williams was Tech's sole first-team Associated Press All-American and also was named to the American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of American and Walter Camp All-America teams. He recorded 44 tackles and an interception for the Hokies in the regular season. Williams had foregone entering the NFL draft after the <a href="2004%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2004 college football season</a> in order to return to Virginia Tech for his senior season, and he was expected to be a high draft pick upon graduation.

The 2006 Gator Bowl <a href="kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> at 12:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> on January 2, 2006 in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Official attendance for the game was listed as 63,780, placing it at 34th (out of 62) on the list of Gator Bowls in terms of attendance. At kickoff, the weather was mostly cloudy with a temperature of approximately 76 degrees. The wind was from the south-southwest at . Approximately 4.14 million American households watched the game on television, earning the game a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.93. The pre-game show featured the <a href="Marching%20Virginians">Marching Virginians</a>, the Cardinal Marching Band, and the Wachovia Dance Team, a collection of Jacksonville-area entertainers. Also before kickoff, the stadium was overflown by a flight of <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a href="F/A-18%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18 Super Hornet</a>s from <a href="VFA-103">VFA-103</a>, based in Virginia. The <a href="Star%20Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> was sung by Monty Lane Allen, member of a <a href="Gospel%20music">Gospel</a> singing group.<ref name="pregame/halftime">The Gator Bowl Association. "2006 Toyota Gator Bowl Gameday Program". Host Communications. December 2006. Page 12.</ref>

Virginia Tech won the ceremonial pre-game <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a> to select first possession and deferred its option to the second half; Louisville elected to receive the opening kick. The Cardinals began the game's opening drive at their own 18-yard line after the opening kickoff. Running back <a href="Michael%20Bush">Michael Bush</a> <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushed</a> for 12 yards on the game's opening play, netting the game's first first down. Subsequent plays, however, saw Louisville struggle to gain another. Facing fourth down and six yards at their own 34-yard line, the Cardinals seemingly prepared to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a>. Instead, the Cardinals executed a <a href="trick%20play">trick play</a> by <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Kolby Smith, who ran with the ball. Smith surprised the Tech defense and broke free for a 30-yard run, converting the first down and continuing the Louisville drive. Eight plays later, Louisville quarterback Hunter Cantwell connected on an 11-yard <a href="forward%20pass">pass</a> to Mario Urrutia for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and the game's first points. The <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> kick was good, and with 10:42 remaining in the first quarter, Louisville took a 7–0 lead.

Virginia Tech's first possession of the game began at its own 32-yard line after Louisville's post-touchdown kickoff. Tech running back <a href="Cedric%20Humes">Cedric Humes</a> gained 12 yards and a first down on the Hokies' first play of the game, and quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> completed a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Hyman three plays later to get another first down and drive the Hokies into Louisville territory. After Vick was stopped for losses on two consecutive rushing plays, he completed another long pass to Hyman for a first down. Subsequent plays saw Tech advance into the Louisville <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23R">red zone</a> but fail to gain another first down. Kicker Brandon Pace entered the game to attempt a 36-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> kick, which was successful. With six minutes remaining in the first quarter, Tech cut Louisville's lead to 7–3.

Louisville's second drive of the game was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After beginning at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80 yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech <a href="Penalty%20%28American%20football%29%23Personal%20Foul">personal foul penalties</a>. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and was removed from the field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.

Tech received the ball at its 20-yard line with 2:44 remaining in the first quarter. Three quick rushes picked up 22 yards and two first downs, pushing the ball to the Tech 42-yard line. On the next play, however, wide receiver <a href="Justin%20Harper%20%28American%20football%29">Justin Harper</a> committed a 15-yard <a href="pass%20interference">pass interference</a> penalty, which negated much of the previous plays' gains. Marcus Vick rushed for five yards, threw two incomplete passes, and was unable to get another first down after the penalty. With time winding down in the quarter, Tech was forced to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a> the ball away. The game's first punt traveled 53 yards, and Louisville took over on offense at its 40-yard line following a 25-yard <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> as time expired in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Louisville led Virginia Tech, 14–3.

Louisville began the second quarter in possession of the ball at its 40-yard line. Despite having good <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23F">field position</a>, the Cardinals were unable to gain more than four yards on three plays and were forced into their first punt of the game. Throughout much of the second quarter, both teams traded punts as each went <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a> on several occasions. By the quarter's halfway point, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice in the period. Louisville punted the ball three times after kicking no punts at all in the first quarter.

After the third Louisville punt, Virginia Tech took over at its 46-yard line. Unlike the previous second-quarter possessions, which saw the Tech offense struggle to move the ball effectively, Tech began its drive with a five-yard rush. After losing seven yards on the next play, Marcus Vick completed a 19-yard pass to <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> <a href="Jeff%20King%20%28American%20football%20player%29">Jeff King</a>, driving the Hokies into Louisville territory for the first time in the quarter. Two plays later, Vick connected with wide receiver Justin Harper on a 33-yard pass that resulted in the Hokies' first touchdown of the game. With 4:56 remaining in the first half of the game, Tech trimmed Louisville's lead to 14–10.

Following the Tech touchdown, Louisville attempted to answer with points of its own before halftime. After starting on his own 20-yard line, Hunter Cantwell completed two quick passes that resulted in 26 yards. Two plays later, Michael Bush broke free for a 34-yard run, driving Louisville deep into the Virginia Tech side of the field. Despite having a first down at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line, Louisville was unable to gain any yards on three consecutive plays. Bush was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, and two Cantwell passes fell incomplete. Kicker Arthur Carmody came in to complete a 35-yard field goal, and with 2:16 remaining in the first half, Louisville led by a score of 17–10.

After receiving Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech elected to <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">run out the clock</a> and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then <a href="Stomp%20%28strike%29">stomped</a> on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At the end of the first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.

The second half of play began with Virginia Tech receiving the ball, going three and out, and punting the ball back to Louisville. The Cardinals reciprocated by also going three and out and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their second drive of the quarter at their one-yard line. Despite beginning deep in their own end of the field, Virginia Tech mounted a successful drive. Tailback Branden Ore and quarterback Marcus Vick alternated rushes, picking up 18 yards and a first down. After Vick was <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> by the Louisville defense, he recovered by throwing a 29-yard pass for another first down. Following the pass, Vick and Ore rushed for six consecutive plays, alternating carries at various intervals. Inside the Louisville red zone, however, the Cardinals' defense stiffened and the Tech offense began to falter. After Tech successfully gained a first down on fourth and one, the Hokies were unable to gain another. Tech kicker Brandon Pace was forced to make his second field goal of the game, this one a 28-yarder, to make the game 17–13 with 2:52 remaining in the quarter. The Tech drive began with 11:17 remaining in the quarter and took eight minutes and 25 seconds off the clock.

Louisville received the post-field goal kickoff, but again went three and out, punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. Louisville did not pick up a first down in the third quarter, and Tech began yet another drive as time ran out in the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech narrowed the Louisville lead to 17–13.

Shortly after the fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive that began in the waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of the fourth quarter. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29 yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33 seconds and two plays to travel 58 yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just two plays to score, so too did it take Virginia Tech two plays to answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking over at his team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver <a href="David%20Clowney">David Clowney</a>. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24 yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28 seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a> on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and two-point conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.

The Cardinals began their second drive of the quarter at their own 25-yard line. In fits and starts, the Louisville offense advanced down the field. Kolby Smith ran for a yard, Michael Bush for two, then six yards, and Cantwell completed two passes of seven yards each. The Cardinals were also helped by a defensive pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, which gave Louisville a first down by penalty. As Louisville began to enter Tech territory in earnest, however, the Cardinals suffered their first turnover of the game. Facing third down and three yards from the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, Cantwell was sacked and <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball. Tech defender <a href="Xavier%20Adibi">Xavier Adibi</a> scooped up the loose ball, and Tech gained the initiative. Following the fumble, the Hokies began a drive at their 47-yard line. On the first play, Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty on Louisville. The penalty was followed by a three-yard Cedric Humes rush and yet another pass interference penalty against Louisville. Humes rushed twice more for five yards, and Vick completed a 16-yard pass to David Clowney before Vick completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeff King. The score and subsequent extra point gave Virginia Tech a 28–24 lead—its first of the game—with 6:03 remaining.

Louisville took over on offense needing to get a touchdown to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10 yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell <a href="Quarterback%20scramble">scramble</a>d for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28American%20football%29">James Anderson</a> jumped and caught the ball, <a href="interception">intercepting</a> it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39 yards into the end zone for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.

Louisville returned on offense, needing to score quickly, make a stop on defense, then score a second time to take the lead. The energized Tech defense was disinclined to allow any such thing. Though Cantwell completed two short passes for 16 yards and a first down, he was sacked on first down and the Tech defense prevented him from completing another pass. Two passes were knocked down by Hokie defenders, while another fell short. After Louisville failed to convert a fourth down, Virginia Tech took over on offense. The Hokies proceeded to <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">run out the clock</a>, executing two short rushes and an incomplete pass. Louisville had one final chance on offense after a Tech punt, but three consecutive desperation <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">Hail Mary pass</a>es were unsuccessful. Two fell incomplete, and the third was intercepted by Tech <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="Brandon%20Flowers%20%28American%20football%29">Brandon Flowers</a>. With time almost gone, Tech finished running out the clock and secured the victory. As time expired, Virginia Tech held a 35–24 lead and won the 2006 Gator Bowl.

<a href="Running%20back">Running back</a> <a href="Cedric%20Humes">Cedric Humes</a> was named the game's most valuable player for Virginia Tech, and <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> Hunter Cantwell was named the Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech punter Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl record for punt yardage and average punt distance, kicking the ball six times for 300 yards, an average of 50 yards per kick.

Despite being more highly promoted in pregame media coverage, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was outperformed statistically by Louisville's Hunter Cantwell. Vick completed 11 of 21 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 10 yards on 13 carries. Cantwell, meanwhile, completed 15 of his 37 passes for 216 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions.

On the ground, Tech running back Cedric Humes led all <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushers</a> with 22 carries for 113 yards and one touchdown. Louisville's leading rusher, Michael Bush, had 16 carries for 94 yards and one <a href="fumble">fumble</a>. The third-leading rusher in the game was Tech's Branden Ore, who carried the ball 11 times for 56 yards. Louisville's <a href="Kolby%20Smith">Kolby Smith</a> carried the ball three times for 32 yards, including a 30-yard run that was the game's second-longest rushing play.

Defensively, Virginia Tech dominated, intercepting the ball three times, forcing a fumble once, and earning one defensive touchdown. Two Louisville defenders had the best individual performances during the game, however. <a href="Brandon%20Johnson">Brandon Johnson</a> and Abe Brown had six tackles apiece, and Brown sacked Marcus Vick once for a loss of ten yards. The sack was one of three earned by the Louisville offense during the game. Virginia Tech's defense earned two sacks during the game, and the Hokies' leading tackler was Vince Hall, who recorded four and two assists on sacks of Louisville's Hunter Cantwell.

Virginia Tech's victory in the 2006 Gator Bowl had far-reaching effects for both the Hokies and the Louisville Cardinals. The win pushed Tech to 11–2 on the season, while the Cardinals' loss ensured they ended the 2005 season with a 9–3 overall record. The game itself provided more than $14 million in economic benefit to the Jacksonville area as Louisville and Virginia Tech fans flocked to the region, spending money on food, hotel rooms, transportation, and entertainment.

Virginia Tech quarterbacks coach <a href="Kevin%20Rogers%20%28American%20football%29">Kevin Rogers</a> announced after the game that he would be leaving the team in order to become an assistant coach with the NFL's <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>. Rogers was replaced by new hire Mike O'Cain. Tech offensive coordinator <a href="Bryan%20Stinespring">Bryan Stinespring</a>'s second job as offensive line coach was filled by <a href="James%20Madison%20University">James Madison University</a> assistant coach Curt Newsome.

Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> stormed off the field, refusing to talk to reporters following the loss. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in that game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006 Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Elvis%20Dumervil">Elvis Dumervil</a>. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology was made. In the wake of the incident, Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.

On January 6, 2006, just a few days after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech officials dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 <a href="traffic%20stop">traffic stop</a> in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, "It's not a big deal. I'll just move on to the next level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he has been out of football ever since.

On April 29 and 30, the National Football League held its annual player draft. Over a dozen players who participated in the 2006 Gator Bowl were selected in the draft. Virginia Tech had a record nine players selected in the draft, with Darryl Tapp (31st overall) selected first from the Hokies. Jimmy Williams (37th overall), <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28American%20football%29">James Anderson</a> (88th), <a href="Jeff%20King%20%28American%20football%29">Jeff King</a> (155th), <a href="Jonathan%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%29">Jonathan Lewis</a> (177th), <a href="Justin%20Hamilton%20%28American%20football%29">Justin Hamilton</a> (222nd), Jimmy Martin (227th), <a href="Will%20Montgomery">Will Montgomery</a> (234th), and Cedric Humes (240th) were the other Tech players selected. Louisville had four players selected in the draft. Offensive guard <a href="Jason%20Spitz">Jason Spitz</a> was selected 75th overall and was the first Cardinals' offensive lineman to be drafted since 1996. Elvis Dumervil was selected with the 126th selection, <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Brandon%20Johnson">Brandon Johnson</a> was selected 142nd, and defensive tackle Montavious Stanley was selected 182nd.

England national football team manager

The role of an England national football team manager was first established in 1946 with the appointment of <a href="Walter%20Winterbottom">Walter Winterbottom</a>. Before this, the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England team</a> was selected by the "International Selection Committee", a process in which <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> (FA) would select coaches and <a href="Athletic%20trainer">trainers</a> from the league to prepare the side for single games, but where all decisions ultimately remained under the control of the committee. A 1–0 defeat by <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> prompted FA secretary <a href="Stanley%20Rous">Stanley Rous</a> to raise Winterbottom from "National Director of coaching" to "Manager".

Eighteen men have occupied the post since its inception; four of those were in short-term <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a> roles: <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> (seven games in charge), <a href="Howard%20Wilkinson">Howard Wilkinson</a> (two games, a year apart from one another), <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> (one game) and <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a> (one game). In comparison, Winterbottom held the position for the longest to date; a tenure of 16 years, comprising four <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cups</a> and a total of 139 matches. <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> is the only manager to have won a major tournament, winning the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a> with his "Wingless Wonders". No other manager has progressed beyond the semi-finals of a major competition before or since, with only three managers achieving a semi-final appearance: <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> at the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 World Cup</a>, <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> at <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">Euro 1996</a>, and <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> at the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 World Cup</a>.

Swedish coach <a href="Sven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</a> became the first foreign manager of the team in January 2001 amid much acrimony; he helped the team to three successive quarter-finals in major championships. Italian manager <a href="Fabio%20Capello">Fabio Capello</a> replaced <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a> in December 2007, after England failed to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying">qualify</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">Euro 2008</a>. Capello's side endured a lacklustre performance during the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a>, but the FA confirmed that he would remain in the role. However, Capello resigned in February 2012, following a disagreement with the FA over their removal of <a href="John%20Terry">John Terry</a>'s <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captaincy</a>. He was replaced, on a caretaker basis, by Stuart Pearce, before <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> was named as Capello's permanent replacement in May 2012. Hodgson's contract finished on 27 June 2016 as England were knocked out of <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016">UEFA Euro 2016</a> by <a href="Iceland%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a> in the round of 16. <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was announced as his successor a month later, but subsequently left the role after just one competitive match. He was replaced on a caretaker basis by <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21</a> coach and former England international defender <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a>, whose position was made permanent after four matches.

The England manager's job is subject to intense press scrutiny, often including revelations about the incumbent's private life. Due to the high level of expectation of both the public and media the role has been described as "the impossible job" or compared in importance in national culture to that of the British <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>.

The England manager's role means he has sole responsibility for all on-the-field elements of the England team. Among other activities, this includes selecting the national team squad, the starting team, <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a>, <a href="Football%20tactics%20and%20skills">tactics</a>, <a href="substitute%20%28football%29">substitutes</a> and <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a>-takers. Before 1946, the "Select Committee" (as appointed by the FA) would manage all issues barring the actual match day team selection, formation and tactics which was left to the head coach for the event. However interference was common, and not only from the FA. After the Second World War, with the relaunch of competitive international calendar, the manager's role expanded to take in all elements: from the selection of hotel and training camp venues, through to food and travel arrangements.

The manager is given a free hand in selecting his coaching ("back room") staff. For example, in 2008 Fabio Capello appointed four Italians (<a href="Franco%20Baldini">Franco Baldini</a> as general manager, <a href="Italo%20Galbiati">Italo Galbiati</a> as assistant coach, <a href="Franco%20Tancredi">Franco Tancredi</a> as goalkeeping coach and Massimo Neri as fitness coach); he then appointed Englishman <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a>, the <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21s</a> coach, as an England coach, with Capello stating "From the start I made it clear that I wanted an English coach as part of my coaching team."

The England manager may also involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues. The England manager is expected to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system that surrounds the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign. On a more tactical level, a host of other details can be influenced; Capello is even believed to have instructed the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> <a href="ball%20boy">ball boy</a>s to return balls at speed when they go out of play.

The process of appointing a new England manager is undertaken by an FA committee, comprising board members and other high-ranking FA officials. For example, the members of the selection panel which appointed Sven-Göran Eriksson in 2001 were: chief executive <a href="Adam%20Crozier">Adam Crozier</a>, chairman <a href="Geoff%20Thompson%20%28football%29">Geoff Thompson</a>, vice-chairman <a href="Dave%20Richards">Dave Richards</a>, club chairmen and FA board members <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> and <a href="Peter%20Ridsdale">Peter Ridsdale</a>, and technical director <a href="Howard%20Wilkinson">Howard Wilkinson</a>.

The England manager's job has been compared in importance to that of the Prime Minister. Passion for football as England's national sport is coupled with patriotism and Wembley Stadium as the "home" of football. The dismissal or appointment of an England manager is front-page news and the subject of intense interest. Large sums are wagered on England winning, and during tournaments the country is festooned in <a href="Saint%20George%27s%20Cross">Saint George's</a> flags; during the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>, 27% of English adults bought a flag in one month alone. Shops and offices will be deserted as vast numbers of people watch the game.

The England manager's job is made more complex by his dependence on the co-operation of clubs and their managers in releasing players for friendlies, and "club versus country" conflict is said to have happened when permission is refused, given reluctantly, or negotiated. There are also repeated comments that the length of the English season (the top flight plays 38 league matches) is unhelpful for preparing tired players for major tournaments, but the self-interest of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> makes a reduction in the number of games unlikely, particularly in light of the 2008 proposal for <a href="Game%2039">Game 39</a>, a match played between Premier League clubs outside the country. This combination of factors, coupled with England's mediocre record in major championships has led to the England manager's job being described as the "impossible job".

Before 1946, the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a> had been under the leadership of a <a href="the%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> (FA) official and a <a href="Athletic%20trainer">trainer</a>, usually from a London club. Appointed in 1946, initially as chief coach, <a href="Walter%20Winterbottom">Walter Winterbottom</a> had been a member of the FA "International Selection Committee". The England squad was selected by an FA committee during his tenure, with Winterbottom's role restricted to selecting the starting team together with the coaching and tactics. In his first game as manager, he led England to a 7–2 victory over <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> at <a href="Windsor%20Park">Windsor Park</a>, <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> in the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20British%20Home%20Championship">1946–47 British Home Championship</a>. Success in the Home Championship in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20British%20Home%20Championship">1950</a> resulted in England's qualification to the <a href="1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1950 World Cup</a> in Brazil. During the tournament, England suffered a <a href="United%20States%20v%20England%20%281950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">shock defeat</a> against the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>, and went out of the tournament with another 1–0 defeat, this time to <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>.

England experienced another surprise upset under Winterbottom's guidance in 1953 when <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungary</a> defeated England <a href="Match%20of%20the%20Century%20%281953%20England%20v%20Hungary%20football%20match%29">6–3</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Winterbottom said afterwards, "... The press tended to think we would win easily, but I tried to point out that the Hungarians were actually a great side." He guided England to first place in the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20British%20Home%20Championship">1953–54 British Home Championship</a>, which qualified the team for the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 World Cup</a> in Switzerland, but saw his side knocked out in the quarter-finals, going down 4–2 against <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>. Three wins and a draw from four matches enabled England's <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 World Cup</a>, only for Winterbottom's side to fail in the group play-off stage, losing 1–0 to the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a>. England lost to <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> in the quarter-final of the <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962 World Cup</a> in Chile and, under attack from the British press, Winterbottom resigned five months later. He remains the longest serving manager of England.

<a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> took control of the team in 1962, but unlike Winterbottom, Ramsey had been a club manager, winning the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">League championship</a> with <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. Upon his appointment, he declared England would win the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a>. His first match in charge resulted in a 5–2 loss at <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>. England automatically qualified for the 1966 World Cup as hosts and, after a goalless draw in the first match against Uruguay, four consecutive victories saw England through to the final against <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>. A 4–2 victory, after <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>, won England the World Cup for the only time. As a result of his and England's achievements, Ramsey was awarded a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> in 1967. The following year England finished third at <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201968">Euro 1968</a> in Rome, but Ramsey reflected "We are world champions. Third place is not our real position."

Automatic qualification for the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970 World Cup</a> was secured as world champions so Ramsey led England on a pre-tournament tour of South America. The effects of altitude on the team led Ramsey to appoint the first full-time team doctor, Neil Phillips, who helped prepare the squad for the forthcoming tournament in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. England were defeated in the quarter-final by West Germany; with a 2–0 lead with 25 minutes of the match remaining, Ramsey substituted <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a> and goalscorer <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a>, but West Germany went on to win 3–2 after extra time. Ramsey was heavily criticised in the British press for the substitutions. Losing out to West Germany again, this time in a two-legged <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201972%20quarter-finals">quarter-final</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201972">Euro 1972</a>, Ramsey prepared England for <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a>. Needing a win against <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland</a>, Ramsey's tactical use of substitutions was again called into question as the match ended in a 1–1 draw. England had failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Ramsey was dismissed the following May.

<a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> took control of the team on a caretaker basis for seven matches, before the FA appointed <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a> on a five-year contract. It was a year before Revie's England suffered a defeat but despite this, he changed his starting line-up for every game. His relationship with the FA had broken down and his team-building exercises, including carpet bowls and indoor golf, led to disconsolation in the squad. A 2–0 defeat to the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> at Wembley Stadium turned the press against him; some commentators compared the loss to the 6–3 defeat by Hungary in 1953. Convinced he was to be replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>, he announced he was to become manager of the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates%20national%20football%20team">United Arab Emirates</a> team. Selling his story to the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", he subsequently resigned on 11 July 1977. Revie was charged with bringing the game into disrepute and was banned by the FA in a "kangaroo court" for ten years. On appeal to the High Court, the ban was overturned but the judge ordered Revie to pay two-thirds of the costs. <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> applied for the position in 1977, but the FA rejected him and <a href="Ron%20Greenwood">Ron Greenwood</a> was appointed, initially as a temporary replacement for Revie, but later in 1977 on a permanent basis. <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a> described him as "the encyclopaedia of football", and he guided England to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980">Euro 1980</a> without a defeat during <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980%20qualifying">qualification</a>.

The team exited the tournament at the group stage and Greenwood turned his attention to <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a> in Spain. Defeats in Switzerland and Romania led Greenwood to consider resignation, but a victory over Hungary convinced him to stay. A 2–1 defeat in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, which led to commentator <a href="Bj%C3%B8rge%20Lillelien">Bjørge Lillelien</a>'s famous outburst concluding with ""Your boys took a hell of a beating!"", meant England required at least a point in their final qualifying game against Hungary. A <a href="Paul%20Mariner">Paul Mariner</a> goal secured victory and qualification for the team. Wins over France, <a href="Czechoslovakia%20national%20football%20team">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="Kuwait%20national%20football%20team">Kuwait</a> allowed England into the second round group but two 0–0 draws ended in England going out of the tournament, without having lost a game. Greenwood retired immediately after the World Cup and on 7 July 1982, two days after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup, Bobby Robson was appointed England manager, selecting former <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> teammate <a href="Don%20Howe">Don Howe</a> as his chief coach.

Robson's tenure included 28 qualifying matches, of which only one, against <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a> in 1983, resulted in a defeat. This contributed to England's failure to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201984%20qualifying">qualify</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201984">Euro 1984</a>, and Robson offered his resignation. It was rejected by the FA chairman, Bert Millichip, and Robson went on to lead the England team to <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualify</a> for the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a> in Mexico. England were defeated in the quarter-final by <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> with a brace of goals from <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>; the infamous <a href="Hand%20of%20God%20goal">"Hand of God" goal</a>, and the "<a href="Goal%20of%20the%20Century">Goal of the Century</a>" he scored five minutes later.

Robson's England dropped only one point in <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988%20qualifying">qualifying</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988">Euro 1988</a>, which included an 8–0 win over <a href="Turkey%20national%20football%20team">Turkey</a>. However, this was followed by failure at the tournament itself, held in West Germany, where England were knocked out in the group stage. They finished bottom of their group, succumbing to defeats against the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a>, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union. Robson was vilified by the British press, and after a draw in a friendly with <a href="Saudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team">Saudi Arabia</a>, one newspaper demanded: "In the name of Allah, go". Robson led England without conceding a goal through <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 World Cup</a>.

As in the 1986 World Cup, Robson was denied the service of his captain, <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a>, who suffered an <a href="achilles%20tendon">achilles tendon</a> injury which prevented him playing in the latter stages of the tournament. England topped their group, accumulating four points from their three games. However their progress was not without controversy. England changed formation from their traditional <a href="4%E2%80%934%E2%80%932">4–4–2</a> to incorporate a <a href="Sweeper%20%28soccer%29">sweeper</a>, with some sources suggesting this was due to player revolt after the 1–1 draw in the first match with the Republic of Ireland. Robson denies this claim in his autobiography. This was followed by victories over <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> and <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon</a> in the knock-out stages, to set up a semi-final with West Germany.

England lost the match on a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>, after the score had been level at 1–1 following extra time. Robson's last public appearance before his death from cancer was at the <a href="Sir%20Bobby%20Robson%20Trophy%20match">Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match</a> in July 2009, played between veterans from that 1990 semi-final as a tribute to his life and in aid of his cancer charity.

Robson had announced before the tournament that he would step down from the post after the finals and <a href="Graham%20Taylor">Graham Taylor</a> was appointed, having been approached in April 1990 by the FA. Failure to proceed past the group stage of <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201992">Euro 1992</a> with a 2–1 defeat against <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a> led to newspaper headlines such as "Swedes 2 Turnips 1" and Taylor's nickname of "Turnip Head". Following defeat to the Netherlands in the penultimate <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualifying</a> match for the <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994 World Cup</a>, for only the third time in its history, England had failed to qualify for the World Cup. The qualifying campaign was recorded in a television documentary, and Taylor's remark "Do I not like that" soon after entered popular culture.

Failure in the qualification resulted in Taylor resigning, and <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> took over the helm in 1994. As England were hosts for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">Euro 1996</a>, he did not manage the team in a competitive match for over two years. In January 1996, he announced that he would resign after the tournament as a result of several court cases, but led England to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> on penalties. He was replaced by <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>, whose unorthodox off-the-field approach in bringing in <a href="faith%20healer">faith healer</a> Eileen Drewery to help the team drew significant criticism. Hoddle suggested she was "more of an agony aunt" but during the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 World Cup</a>, the press suggested Drewery had influenced Hoddle in squad selection. England were knocked out of the tournament in the second round, once again on penalties, this time against Argentina. Hoddle's diary portraying his version of events at the World Cup was subsequently published, drawing further criticism.

An interview with Matt Dickinson, a reporter from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", suggested that Hoddle had a "controversial belief that the disabled, and others, are being punished for sins in a <a href="former%20life">former life</a>." Hoddle's comments were criticised by several notable politicians, including Sports Minister <a href="Tony%20Banks%2C%20Baron%20Stratford">Tony Banks</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>. Hoddle stated that he was not prepared to resign and claimed his words were misinterpreted and pointed out his contributions and commitment to organisations helping the disabled. The FA terminated Hoddle's contract soon afterwards, which was welcomed by representatives of disabled groups.

Howard Wilkinson was caretaker manager for two games, before the appointment of <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> in February 1999. Initially combining the job with a role at <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, Keegan was made full-time coach in May. He led England to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20qualifying">qualification</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">Euro 2000</a> following success in a two-legged play-off against <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a>. Two 3–2 losses resulted in England leaving the tournament at the group stage. A loss to Germany in the last international match at the old Wembley Stadium in the first <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">2002 World Cup qualifying</a> match led to Keegan's resignation. Keegan resigned an hour after the team was booed off by England fans; he told the FA officials that he felt "a little short at this level". Wilkinson again returned as caretaker for one more match, followed by <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> who presided over a friendly loss to Italy.

The FA then took the unprecedented, and widely criticised step of appointing the first non-Englishman as coach, in the form of Swede <a href="Sven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</a>. Eriksson had a good record in European domestic football, with success in Portugal and Italy, and had led clubs to win the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> on two occasions. He led England to qualify for the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 World Cup</a> with <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> scoring the vital equaliser against <a href="Greece%20national%20football%20team">Greece</a>, deep into injury time. England were knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals and Eriksson came under fire for his "ice-cool" appearance on the touchline failing to inspire his team, senior player <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> remarking after the tournament that "we needed <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> but we got <a href="Iain%20Duncan%20Smith">Iain Duncan Smith</a>".

Eriksson led England to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004%20qualifying">qualification</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a> but once more the team fell at the quarter-final stage, again losing on penalties, this time to <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a>. Losing 1–0 to <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> in Belfast during the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the 2006 World Cup led to fans chanting "Sack the Swede", frustrated again at the lack of obvious emotion in Eriksson while his coach, <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a>, was much more animated.

In January 2006, the FA announced that Eriksson would stand down after the World Cup. With the team losing in the quarter-final again to Portugal and again on penalties, Eriksson duly left the post in July. The search for Eriksson's replacement was controversial. It became clear that the FA wanted to appoint <a href="Luiz%20Felipe%20Scolari">Luiz Felipe Scolari</a>, but the approach was botched, and Scolari turned down the offer. Ultimately, Eriksson was replaced by the man who had coached the side under him, Steve McClaren.

<a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying">Qualification</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">Euro 2008</a> proved too much, England losing the final qualifier against <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a> 3–2 in November 2007, when a draw would have been enough to take England to the finals. The British press turned on McClaren, former Scottish international <a href="Alan%20Hansen">Alan Hansen</a> stating that "... what McClaren should be held accountable for is that with a squad of this quality he failed to qualify from what seemed a reasonably straightforward group ...". McClaren was dismissed the day following the defeat to Croatia, and was replaced in December 2007 by Italian <a href="Fabio%20Capello">Fabio Capello</a>. The defeat to Croatia is remembered in the sports press for the infamous moniker “Wally with the Brolly”, a reference to McLaren’s pitchside presence under an umbrella in a match played in heavy rain.

Capello led England to <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a>, winning nine of the team's ten qualifying matches. However, the team's performance in the tournament proper was less impressive. Two lacklustre draws in the group stage against the United States and <a href="Algeria%20national%20football%20team">Algeria</a> were followed by an ignominious 4–1 defeat by traditional rivals Germany in the Round of 16. The team's performance was at least partly attributed to selection and tactical errors by Capello and led to calls for his dismissal. However, on 2 July, the FA confirmed that he would remain in the role until 2012, with Capello himself confirming his intention to step down and retire after <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202012">Euro 2012</a>.

Conflicting reports came out of the FA as to whether the next manager would be English. On 15 August 2010, the FA's Adrian Bevington stated to the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> that "we should have an English manager after (Euro 2012)", but on 22 September, the FA's Director of Football Development, <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Trevor Brooking</a>, stated that "We would like to go English (but) we've got to see what English people are available". Two weeks later, Capello's England <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202012%20qualifying">qualified</a> for Euro 2012 with a 2–2 draw away against <a href="Montenegro%20national%20football%20team">Montenegro</a>. In February 2012, Capello resigned following the FA's decision to remove the captaincy of the national side from <a href="John%20Terry">John Terry</a>, with Englishman Stuart Pearce taking over the role on a caretaker basis.

Following a 3–2 defeat at Wembley Stadium by the Netherlands in February, Pearce was replaced on 1 May 2012 by West Bromwich Albion manager <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> on a four-year contract. Despite being based in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> in Poland, England's first fixture in Euro 2012 was in <a href="Donetsk">Donetsk</a> against France, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Subsequent victories over Sweden and tournament co-hosts <a href="Ukraine%20national%20football%20team">Ukraine</a> resulted in a quarter-final match against Italy. The game ended goalless after extra time, sending the game to a penalty shoot-out which Italy won 4–2. Hodgson claimed that England's exit from major tournaments had become a "national obsession". With a 2–0 victory over Poland in October 2013, Hodgson led England to <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a> for the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2014 World Cup</a>.

However, in the 2014 World Cup, England lost two consecutive group matches, against Italy and Uruguay, by 2–1 on each occasion. This was the first time England had lost two group matches since the 1950 World Cup (when they lost against the United States and Spain) and the first time England had been eliminated at the group stage since the 1958 World Cup. This was also the first time that England had not won a match at the tournament since 1958, and England's points total of one from three matches was its worst ever in the World Cup.

England <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016%20qualifying">qualified</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016">UEFA Euro 2016</a> in September 2015, following a 6–0 win over San Marino. On 27 June 2016, almost immediately after England were knocked out 2–1 by <a href="Iceland%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a> in the round of 16, Hodgson resigned as manager.

On 22 July, <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed England manager on a two-year contract. After only 67 days in the job, a video published by "The Daily Telegraph" showed Allardyce making insulting statements against former manager Roy Hodgson, and explaining how to circumvent regulations of The FA on third party ownership of players. He subsequently left the role as manager of England later that day. Former England international defender and England under-21 coach Gareth Southgate was given the senior role on a caretaker basis for four matches while the FA considered their options. Two wins, including a 3–0 victory over Scotland, and a draw in <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualifying</a> matches for the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 World Cup</a> and a 2–2 draw with Spain in a friendly followed under Southgate's temporary management, before he was formally appointed to the position full-time on 30 November 2016 on a four-year deal.

The reaction of the British media to the England national team manager reflects the changing nature of the British media generally. In recent times, managers have been attacked personally, for their personal beliefs, or private lives.

The press had long campaigned for changes in management style and / or replacement of the manager himself, but a <a href="wiktionary%3AWatershed">watershed</a> was reached under the tenure of Graham Taylor, whose unsuccessful reign led to the manager being pilloried in the <a href="tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a>s. Most notably, "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper reacted to a damaging defeat by Sweden at Euro 1992, by the accompaniment of the headline "Swedes 2 Turnips 1" with a photographic <a href="Montage%20%28filmmaking%29">montage</a> of a <a href="turnip">turnip</a> superimposed on Taylor's head. Taylor was thereafter often referred to in the media as "Graham Turnip" or "Turnip Taylor".

Subsequent footballing ignominies were then followed by other depictions of Taylor as a vegetable; England's first game after Euro 92 ended in a 1–0 defeat to Spain, and "The Sun" pictured Taylor as a "Spanish onion". When he resigned, following the loss of the 1994 World Cup spot to <a href="Norway%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a>, they reverted to the turnip image, accompanying the front-page headline, "That's yer allotment".

Following Roy Hodgson's appointment, "The Sun" mocked his <a href="Rhotacism%20%28speech%20impediment%29">rhotacism</a> manner of speech with a "Bwing on the Euwos!" front-page headline. The FA called the headline "unacceptable" and more than 100 people complained to the <a href="Press%20Complaints%20Commission">Press Complaints Commission</a>.

Glenn Hoddle attracted the media spotlight for two key issues unrelated to on-the-pitch affairs. In the first, his reliance upon purported faith healer Eileen Drewery was questioned. Drewery became part of the official England staff, and players were pressured to see her, even though many of them were sceptical. However, far more opprobrium was caused by Hoddle's comments about disabled people: 

Public opinion, based upon the immediate media furore resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as English coach. However, the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments insensitive to the disabled, others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to dismiss him would constitute <a href="religious%20discrimination">religious discrimination</a>.

Eriksson's private life came under scrutiny, with a number of well-publicised accusations of trysts with women including <a href="Ulrika%20Jonsson">Ulrika Jonsson</a>, and FA secretary <a href="Faria%20Alam">Faria Alam</a>, despite his on-going relationship with <a href="Nancy%20Dell%27Olio">Nancy Dell'Olio</a>. Though Eriksson maintained in press conferences that his personal life was a private matter, his relationships with Jonsson in 2002 and Alam in 2004 were subject to tabloid headlines for several weeks.

The media, both broadsheet and tabloid, have sometimes campaigned for a manager to be dismissed, appointed or retained. Campaigns for managers to be dismissed have been front-page news, with eye-catching headlines including "The final ron-devouz", "In the Name of Allah Go", "Norse Manure", "Blair Gives Hoddle The Red Card" for (respectively) Greenwood, Robson, Taylor and Hoddle.

Eriksson survived several scandals whilst in office, but his tenure was eventually ended when he was one of a series of celebrities targeted by a tabloid 'sting', orchestrated by "The Fake Sheikh", <a href="Mazher%20Mahmood">Mazher Mahmood</a>. Eriksson's indiscretions revealed by the newspaper "... proved the final straw for the FA", although Eriksson was permitted to stay on in the role until the end of the 2006 World Cup.

These campaigns have also sometimes backfired. Former FA chief executive, <a href="Graham%20Kelly%20%28football%20administrator%29">Graham Kelly</a> recalled a campaign, orchestrated by "The Sun" against Bobby Robson, that began in 1984 (six years before his resignation): 
Sections of the media have often campaigned for a particular person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman <a href="Bert%20Millichip">Bert Millichip</a> "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian – give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's the end of the clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." Robson added, "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I think he would have been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.

Steve McClaren received media criticism, and, as failure to qualify for Euro 2008 looked increasingly likely, the headlines became more visceral. In January 2008, football magazine "When Saturday Comes" described the newspaper coverage of his final month as "relentless and remorseless". Both tabloids and broadsheets published critical pieces, with "The Times" headlining an editorial "Fail and McClaren has to go".

The media have also parodied this genre of campaigns for recruitment, dismissal or retention of managers. In October 2000, "The Sun" launched a campaign promoting a donkey as the new England manager.

2008 UAW-Dodge 400

The 2008 UAW-Dodge 400 was the third <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car race</a> of the <a href="2008%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series">2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series</a>. It was held on March 2, 2008, before a crowd of 153,000 in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, Nevada, at <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Motor%20Speedway">Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a>, one of ten <a href="Oval%20track%20racing%23Intermediate%20tracks">intermediate</a> tracks to hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races. The 267-lap race was won by <a href="Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</a> of the <a href="Roush%20Fenway%20Racing">Roush Fenway Racing</a> team who started from second position. <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> finished second and Edwards' teammate <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> came in third.

<a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> won the <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, which he held for 20 laps until he was passed by Edwards. He held the lead until the first <a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">green-flag</a> <a href="pit%20stops">pit stops</a> and regained the position after the stops ended. Busch retook the lead on lap 81 and held it until he was passed by <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a>. <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> took over the lead on lap 163, before Earnhardt became the leader on the 181st lap and maintained this position until Edwards regained it 14 laps later. The race was stopped for 17 minutes when Gordon crashed on lap 262, and car parts were strewn into the path of other drivers, requiring officials to clean the track. Edwards maintained the lead at the restart and held it to win the race. There were eleven <a href="Caution%20flag">cautions</a> and 19 lead changes by nine different drivers during the race.

The race was Edwards' second consecutive win of the season, and the ninth of his career. Edwards was later issued with a 100-point penalty after his car was found to violate NASCAR regulations, dropping him from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. Kyle Busch increased his lead over <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> to 20 points as a consequence. <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> took over the lead of the Manufacturers' Championship, five points ahead of <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a>. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> moved clear of <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> in third place, with 33 races left in the season. The race attracted 12.1 million television viewers.

The UAW-Dodge 400 was the third out of 36 scheduled <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car race</a>s of the <a href="2008%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series">2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series</a>. It was held on March 2, 2008, in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, Nevada, at <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Motor%20Speedway">Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a>, one of ten <a href="Oval%20track%20racing%23Intermediate%20tracks">intermediate</a> tracks to hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races; the others are <a href="Atlanta%20Motor%20Speedway">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20Motor%20Speedway">Charlotte Motor Speedway</a>, <a href="Chicagoland%20Speedway">Chicagoland Speedway</a>, <a href="Darlington%20Raceway">Darlington Raceway</a>, <a href="Homestead-Miami%20Speedway">Homestead-Miami Speedway</a>, <a href="Kansas%20Speedway">Kansas Speedway</a>, <a href="Kentucky%20Speedway">Kentucky Speedway</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Motor%20Speedway">New Hampshire Motor Speedway</a>, and <a href="Texas%20Motor%20Speedway">Texas Motor Speedway</a>.

In preparation for the race, NASCAR held the second of its two pre-season tests for Sprint Cup entrants on January 28–29 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Sessions began at 9:00 a.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> (EST), paused from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., and concluded at 5:00 p.m. Sixty-seven cars participated in the January 28 morning session; <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> was quickest with a top speed of , while Kyle Busch was quickest in the afternoon session, with a top speed of . Several incidents occurred during the second session; <a href="Regan%20Smith">Regan Smith</a> spun leaving turn-two and damaged his car's nose after hitting the inside wall; <a href="Sam%20Hornish%20Jr.">Sam Hornish Jr.</a> heavily damaged his car after scraping the wall hard; and <a href="Dario%20Franchitti">Dario Franchitti</a> heavily damaged his Dodge's rear after spinning. <a href="Jacques%20Villeneuve">Jacques Villeneuve</a> spun but did not damage his car; <a href="David%20Ragan">David Ragan</a> wrecked after spinning off turn-two; and <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> damaged the front of his vehicle when he hit a cement piling after swerving to avoid a tow truck. During the third session with seventy-four cars, Edwards had the fastest speed of , and Burton damaged the right-hand side of his car after hitting the wall. <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20Montoya">Juan Pablo Montoya</a> recorded the fastest speed of the two days, at in the fourth and final session.

Edwards was looking forward to the race weekend and felt that his result would be good. Biffle was confident he could secure a top-five finishing position, and stated if his car's handling was good, he believed he could be in contention for winning the race. Having won twice at the track in the early 2000s, Kenseth stated that he enjoyed racing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and hoped the <a href="Roush%20Fenway%20Racing">Roush Fenway Racing</a> cars would be able to contend for race victories. Johnson was considered by some bookmakers as the favorite to win the race, and in the event he succeeded, he would have become the first person to secure four consecutive victories in a NASCAR Cup Series racing event since Gordon won the <a href="Bojangles%27%20Southern%20500">Southern 500</a> four times between 1995 and 1998. He said that it would be "great" if he took the victory but would not approach the event differently than at a track where he had not won a race.

There was one change of driver before the race. <a href="Jon%20Wood">Jon Wood</a>, the grandson of retired driver <a href="Glen%20Wood">Glen Wood</a>, was originally scheduled to replace <a href="1988%20NASCAR%20Winston%20Cup%20Series">1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series</a> champion <a href="Bill%20Elliott">Bill Elliott</a> in the No. 21 <a href="Wood%20Brothers%20Racing">Wood Brothers Racing</a> car, but withdrew because of a lack of experience with the <a href="Car%20of%20Tomorrow">Car of Tomorrow</a>, and former <a href="Stewart-Haas%20Racing">Haas CNC Racing</a> driver <a href="Johnny%20Sauter">Johnny Sauter</a> took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had <a href="2008%20NASCAR%20Nationwide%20Series">Nationwide Series</a> driver <a href="Jason%20Keller">Jason Keller</a> ready to replace him if he could not compete.

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, one on Friday and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, the second 45 minutes and the third 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 30.009 seconds; <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> was second and Johnson third. Stewart took fourth, and <a href="David%20Reutimann">David Reutimann</a> was placed fifth. <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a>, Edwards, <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a>, Kurt Busch, and <a href="Jeremy%20Mayfield">Jeremy Mayfield</a> rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. Hornish made contact with the turn-two barrier, while <a href="Reed%20Sorenson">Reed Sorenson</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Carpentier">Patrick Carpentier</a> spun in turn-four but avoided damaging their cars. Montoya switched to a back-up car after heavily colliding with the turn-two wall, and <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> did the same after he lost control in turn-four and damaged his left-rear quarter. Kahne made light contact with the turn-four wall, repaired by his team.

Although 47 drivers were entered in the qualifier, according to NASCAR's <a href="Go%20or%20Go%20Home">qualifying procedure</a> only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more <a href="Grip%20%28auto%20racing%29">grip</a>. Edwards felt his car had <a href="Understeer%20and%20oversteer">oversteer</a> during his run. Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career with a time of 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">grid</a>'s front row by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and <a href="Mike%20Skinner%20%28racing%20driver%29">Mike Skinner</a> fifth. Biffle, <a href="Scott%20Riggs">Scott Riggs</a>, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers. The four drivers that failed to qualify were <a href="A.%20J.%20Allmendinger">A. J. Allmendinger</a>, <a href="Joe%20Nemechek">Joe Nemechek</a>, <a href="John%20Andretti">John Andretti</a>, and Sauter (who crashed at turn-two on his first qualifying lap). <a href="Burney%20Lamar">Burney Lamar</a> withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car's potential which was displayed in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been on the accelerator pedal throughout his fastest lap.

On Saturday afternoon, <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> was fastest in the second practice session with a time of 30.321 seconds, ahead of <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a> and Earnhardt. <a href="Travis%20Kvapil">Travis Kvapil</a> was fourth-fastest; <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a> was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and <a href="Paul%20Menard">Paul Menard</a> third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of <a href="Hendrick%20Motorsports">Hendrick Motorsports</a> teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and <a href="Dave%20Blaney">Dave Blaney</a> tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he came down the track and <a href="Kyle%20Petty">Kyle Petty</a> hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.

Live television coverage of the race began at 3:30 p.m. EST in the United States on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were sunny, between , and no rain was expected. Gusty winds from the north created strong headwinds on the back straight. Kenny Farmer, chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Actress <a href="Carol%20Linnae%20Johnson">Carol Linnae Johnson</a> of the stage production <a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%23International%20and%20touring%20productions">Mamma Mia!</a> performed the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a>, and John Byers, co-director of <a href="United%20Automobile%20Workers">UAW</a>-<a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> National Training Center, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="Parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, two drivers moved to the rear of the field because of unapproved changes: Bowyer had switched to a back-up car, and Kahne had changed his engine.

The race started at 4:48 p.m.; Kyle Busch maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was <a href="Racing%20flags%23Black%20flag">black-flagged</a> by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the <a href="Pit%20stop">pit road</a> on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a>, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first <a href="caution%20flag">caution flag</a> and the appearance of the <a href="Safety%20car">pace car</a>. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.

Kyle Busch stayed out and led the field back up to speed on the lap twelve <a href="Rolling%20start">restart</a>. Four laps later, Edwards started to challenge Kyle Busch for the lead. Jeff Gordon moved up to third on lap 18, and Martin moved from third to eighth by the same lap. Kyle Busch and Edwards ran alongside each other in the battle for the first position on lap 20; the battle concluded after Edwards passed Kyle Busch on the following lap. Gordon was passed by Biffle for third place on lap 22, while Kurt Busch moved up to fifth on the same lap. By lap 28, Biffle had closed the gap to Kyle Busch and passed him for second position two laps later. Edwards had a 1.3-second lead over teammate Biffle on the same lap. Kyle Busch fell to fourth place after Gordon passed him on the 33rd lap. Kyle Busch reclaimed the third position from Gordon two laps later; Kurt Busch had moved into third after moving ahead of Gordon on the same lap. By the 42nd lap, Edwards and teammate Biffle had opened a three-second lead over Kyle Busch. Riggs and Kurt Busch both moved in front of Kyle Busch for third and fourth positions on lap 45.

<a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">Green-flag</a> pit stops began on lap 48. Edwards and Biffle made pit stops on lap 49, handing the lead to Riggs. Hornish hit the turn-two outside wall on the following lap after his right-front tire went down in the tri-oval, and sustained damage to his right-front quarter panel, but no debris came off his car. After the pit stops, Edwards regained the lead and held a five-second lead over Kyle Busch; Martin moved into third place, Riggs regained fourth place, and Harvick moved up to fifth place by lap 65. Three laps later, a second caution was needed when debris was spotted at turn-two. Most of the leaders, including Edwards, made pit stops. Jeff Burton chose to remain on the track and led on the lap-75 restart, ahead of Earnhardt and Kyle Busch. On lap 78, Kyle Busch moved ahead of Earnhardt to take second place and began to close the gap to Burton. Kyle Busch passed Burton to reclaim the lead three laps later, and opened up a 1.3-second advantage over Burton by the 92nd lap. Earnhardt was passed by Edwards for fifth place on lap 94 and Biffle got ahead of Gordon for seventh on the same lap. Edwards gained fourth place when he passed Stewart on the 96th lap, and Burton lost second to Kenseth two laps later. On lap 102, Burton fell to fourth place after Edwards passed him.

By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second lead over Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution was triggered when Stewart's car made heavy contact with the turn-two wall after his right-front tire burst. Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that took him to the infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back to the end of the longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a>'s right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution was triggered. All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.

Kenseth remained the leader at the lap-149 restart; he was followed by Gordon. The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier to slide down the track and hit the inside wall. <a href="Ken%20Schrader">Ken Schrader</a> was close by the incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside each other in a battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23A">apron</a> on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.

Edwards passed Earnhardt to reclaim the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further position after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">groove</a>. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box but he was not penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving the tire. Kenseth led the field back up to speed on the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a> hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when <a href="Dale%20Jarrett">Dale Jarrett</a> spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.

Kurt Busch's right-front tire exploded, causing him to hit the wall between turns three and four, and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256. Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash. He was transported to the infield medical center for a mandatory check-up. Edwards remained in the lead for the lap-262 restart. Earnhardt spun his tires, forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt. Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon, who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall, which had no <a href="SAFER%20barrier">SAFER barrier</a> installed. Gordon's car's radiator flew out from its chassis and into the path of oncoming traffic. Kenseth slid but was able to straighten his car and continue. The final caution was initially waved before a <a href="Red%20flag%20%28racing%29">red-flag</a> was shown, stopping the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track. The race resumed 17 minutes later, with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle. Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career. Earnhardt finished second, ahead of Biffle in third, Harvick fourth, and Burton fifth. Ragan, Kahne, Kvapil, Hamlin, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers. Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps, more than any other competitor.

Edwards appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> in front of the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was "a very special win" and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in <a href="2005%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2005</a>: "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." He added, "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong ... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what that felt like. I hate it." Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.

Despite his injury, Stewart said he hoped to participate in a planned two-day test session at <a href="Phoenix%20International%20Raceway">Phoenix International Raceway</a>. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief <a href="Pat%20Tryson">Pat Tryson</a> stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, "I knew he was going to get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit ... We came off [turn] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." Gordon said he hoped <a href="Speedway%20Motorsports">Speedway Motorsports</a> chairman and chief executive <a href="Bruton%20Smith">Bruton Smith</a> (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consulting NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.

After the race, NASCAR announced it had found a problem with the lid on the oil reservoir encasement during a post-race inspection on Edwards' car, which was later taken to the NASCAR Research and Development Center in <a href="Concord%2C%20North%20Carolina">Concord, North Carolina</a>, for further analysis. Three days after the race, <a href="Roush%20Fenway%20Racing">Roush Fenway Racing</a> was given penalties for "actions detrimental to stock car racing", "car, car parts, components and/or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules", and a device or duct work that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another, or to the outside of the car. The penalties included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for Edwards' crew chief <a href="Bob%20Osborne">Bob Osborne</a>, who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30, 2008, and placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner <a href="Jack%20Roush">Jack Roush</a> incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Sprint Cup</a>, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order. Edwards was allowed to keep the victory; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. On March 12, Roush Fenway Racing announced it would not appeal the penalties.

Roush Fenway Racing president Geoff Smith said a bolt that held the oil lid together did not work because of vibration harmonics generated by Edwards' car and the Las Vegas race track. Edwards said the infraction was "an absolute mistake" and that his team had no intention of cheating. Edwards' teammate Biffle and Newman agreed the penalties were justified. According to Sadler, the penalties were not severe enough; he argued that the driver should be penalized or required to miss one event. <a href="Toyota%20Racing%20Development">Toyota Racing Development</a> General Manager Lee White said Roush Fenway Racing had modified Edwards' car to enhance downforce by , which increased the car's horsepower leaving the corners. Roush felt White's comments were motivated by results. White later issued a statement in which he apologized for his comments. An internal investigation found no evidence that another person had intentionally caused the bolt to come loose, and that the team enacted protective measures to ensure the oil lid would stay fastened in future events.

The result meant Kyle Busch maintained his lead in the Drivers' Championship, twenty points ahead of Newman in second place. Kahne's seventh-place finish allowed him to advance into third place, sixteen points in front of Harvick, who also moved up three positions. Biffle was in fifth on 427 points. Burton, Edwards, Truex, Sadler, Earnhardt, Stewart and Kurt Busch rounded out the top twelve. Ford moved into the lead of the Manufacturers' Championship, five points ahead of Dodge. Chevrolet moved three points clear of Toyota. The event had a television audience of 12.1 million viewers; it took three hours, eight minutes, and eight seconds to complete the race, and the margin of victory was 0.504 seconds.

Meet Kevin Johnson

"Meet Kevin Johnson" is the 80th television episode of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a>'s (ABC's) "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>" and the eighth <a href="List%20of%20Lost%20episodes">episode</a> of the <a href="Lost%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a>. It was written in October and November 2007 by supervising producer <a href="Elizabeth%20Sarnoff">Elizabeth Sarnoff</a> and co-producer <a href="Brian%20K.%20Vaughan">Brian K. Vaughan</a>, and directed in November by co-executive producer <a href="Stephen%20Williams%20%28director%29">Stephen Williams</a>. "Meet Kevin Johnson" first aired March 20, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a> in Canada.

In the <a href="Live%20Together%2C%20Die%20Alone">second-season finale</a>, after 67 days of being stranded on a mysterious and mystical tropical island, <a href="Oceanic%20Airlines">Oceanic Airlines</a> 815 crash survivor <a href="Michael%20Dawson%20%28Lost%29">Michael Dawson</a> (played by <a href="Harold%20Perrineau">Harold Perrineau</a>) successfully negotiates his escape via motorboat with the island's dangerous original inhabitants, whom the survivors refer to as the "<a href="Others%20%28Lost%29">Others</a>". One month later in the <a href="Ji%20Yeon">episode before</a> "Meet Kevin Johnson", Michael reappears on a freighter offshore of the island, undercover with the alias "Kevin Johnson". Most of the narrative of "Meet Kevin Johnson" consists of a continuous <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>—the third longest in the show's history after "<a href="Across%20the%20Sea%20%28Lost%29">Across the Sea</a>" and "<a href="The%20Other%2048%20Days">The Other 48 Days</a>"—showing what happened to Michael in the month that he spent away in New York and on the freighter, primarily his recruitment aboard the freighter "Kahana" as a spy for the Others.

The writers completed "Meet Kevin Johnson", the eighth of 16 ordered scripts, on the same day that the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a> action began. Post-production finished weeks later without input from the show's writers. ABC pledged to air the completed eight episodes regardless of the strike's resolution, but the writers felt that the episode's cliffhanger was unsuitable as a potential season finale. ABC ultimately overruled their opposition.

"Meet Kevin Johnson" was watched by 13 million Americans and was met with mixed reactions. A major discussion point was the episode's climax, which was criticized for its placement in the story and its focus on secondary characters. Although critics responded well to Michael's emotional journey, they complained that his physical journey seemed to conflict with "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeline that had been laid out in previous episodes. The episode was honored with the fourth season's sole <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for its achievement in <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Sound%20Mixing%20for%20a%20Comedy%20or%20Drama%20Series%20%28One-Hour%29">sound mixing</a>.

The episode's opening is set on December 26, 2004, over three months after the crash of Oceanic 815. Most of the episode takes place on the freighter "Kahana," moored offshore of the island where the plane crashed. The freighter is owned by <a href="Charles%20Widmore">Charles Widmore</a> (<a href="Alan%20Dale">Alan Dale</a>), who is intent on extracting the Others' leader <a href="Ben%20Linus">Ben Linus</a> (<a href="Michael%20Emerson">Michael Emerson</a>). Captain Gault (<a href="Grant%20Bowler">Grant Bowler</a>) stops two crewmembers from deserting the freighter in a raft. He publicly beats them and shouts that this is to save their lives, reminding the crew of what happened to <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Other%20Kahana%20crew%20members">George Minkowski</a> (<a href="Fisher%20Stevens">Fisher Stevens</a>) when he <a href="The%20Constant">left the boat</a>. The next morning, <a href="Sayid%20Jarrah">Sayid Jarrah</a> (<a href="Naveen%20Andrews">Naveen Andrews</a>) confronts Michael about his motivations, and the narrative shifts into an uninterrupted flashback of Michael's life after escaping from the island.

Michael and his son <a href="Walt%20Lloyd">Walt Lloyd</a> (<a href="Malcolm%20David%20Kelley">Malcolm David Kelley</a>) return to New York. Overcome with guilt, Michael confesses that he murdered <a href="Ana%20Lucia%20Cortez">Ana Lucia Cortez</a> (<a href="Michelle%20Rodriguez">Michelle Rodriguez</a>) and <a href="Libby%20%28Lost%29">Libby</a> (<a href="Cynthia%20Watros">Cynthia Watros</a>) as part of his rescue of Walt from the <a href="Others%20%28Lost%29">Others</a>' captivity. Michael becomes estranged from Walt, who goes to live with Michael's mother (Starletta DuPois). Michael is haunted by apparitions and nightmares of the late Libby. Michael attempts to kill himself in a car crash, but fails. He sells the watch that <a href="Jin-Soo%20Kwon">Jin Kwon</a> (<a href="Daniel%20Dae%20Kim">Daniel Dae Kim</a>) gave him in the <a href="Exodus%20%28Lost%29">first-season finale</a> and buys a gun for another suicide attempt, but this, too, is unsuccessful, because the gun jams. That night, Michael is confronted by <a href="Tom%20Friendly">Tom</a> (<a href="M.%20C.%20Gainey">M.C. Gainey</a>), the Other who abducted Walt. Tom explains that the island will not allow Michael to kill himself, and gives Michael an assignment: Michael must infiltrate the freighter "Kahana" using the pseudonym "Kevin Johnson" and kill everyone on board, who may try to kill his fellow crash survivors. Michael agrees to do it and boards the freighter from Fiji. Michael becomes acquainted with the crew and hesitates to sabotage their mission until he finds <a href="Martin%20Keamy">Martin Keamy</a> (<a href="Kevin%20Durand">Kevin Durand</a>) and his associates target-practicing with machine guns. After Michael tries to detonate a provided bomb only to discover that it is a fake, Ben contacts Michael by radio and explains that the trick illustrated his stance against killing innocent people in his war against Widmore. The flashback ends and Sayid, appalled by Michael's association with Ben, exposes his duplicity to Gault.

On the island in the Others' abandoned Barracks where some of the survivors have taken residence, 815 survivor <a href="John%20Locke%20%28Lost%29">John Locke</a> (<a href="Terry%20O%27Quinn">Terry O'Quinn</a>) meets with his faction to discuss the freighter and Ben reveals that Michael is spying for him there. Ben later urges his adopted daughter <a href="Alex%20%28Lost%29">Alex</a> (<a href="Tania%20Raymonde">Tania Raymonde</a>) to flee to the Others' sanctuary at the "Temple" for safety; she is accompanied by her biological mother <a href="Danielle%20Rousseau">Danielle Rousseau</a> (<a href="Mira%20Furlan">Mira Furlan</a>) and boyfriend <a href="Karl%20%28Lost%29">Karl</a> (<a href="Blake%20Bashoff">Blake Bashoff</a>). On their way, Karl and Rousseau are shot dead by hidden assailants and Alex surrenders.

"Meet Kevin Johnson" features the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in "Lost" since the character was murdered in the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant <a href="Matt%20Ragghianti">Matt Ragghianti</a> that there would be an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby, Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a "Lost" episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> revealed plans to tell her story in the third season. Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season. Executive producer/writer <a href="Carlton%20Cuse">Carlton Cuse</a> further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes. This failed to materialize; however, Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year. The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is "pretty much finished." When Watros returned to "Lost" for "Meet Kevin Johnson", she did not receive the "special guest star" credit, as was customary for former main cast members of "Lost". She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." Damon Lindelof said that "it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Other%20Kahana%20crew%20members">Naomi Dorrit</a> (<a href="Marsha%20Thomason">Marsha Thomason</a>) and <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Other%20Kahana%20crew%20members">George Minkowski</a> (<a href="Fisher%20Stevens">Fisher Stevens</a>), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.

First season regular cast member Malcolm David Kelley returned in an uncredited <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> for a single scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the <a href="Lost%20%28season%201%29">first season</a>. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did not appear in the cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" stated that "You gotta hand it to the "Lost" writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." <a href="TMZ.com">TMZ</a>'s Daniel thought that "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [is] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". "Wizard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nikki Stafford went so far as to remark that "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role."

Having appeared in six episodes of the third season and the first two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical "<a href="Spring%20Awakening%20%28musical%29">Spring Awakening</a>". He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse that he would be unable to shoot "Lost" for at least six months beginning in December 2007, as he rehearsed for and performed in the production. Being "big fans" of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an "amazing opportunity," they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to write him out of the story while they still had him at their disposal. Having decided some time ago that Karl would eventually die, they pinpointed the episode. The cliffhanger of "Meet Kevin Johnson" sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle. Two episodes later, the character <a href="Miles%20Straume">Miles Straume</a> (<a href="Ken%20Leung">Ken Leung</a>) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt, but this corpse is portrayed by a <a href="body%20double">body double</a> and not Bashoff. According to Bashoff, the writers hope that he can return to "Lost" at some point to "serve a cool purpose like [Tom does in 'Meet Kevin Johnson']." In regard to his experience with "Lost", Bashoff recounted that "I love the show. [The cast]'s a great group … and … you get to shoot in paradise"; however, he wished that he had learned more about Karl's backstory.

The <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> went on strike on November 4, 2007—the day that the writers finished editing the final draft of the script of "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season because the eighth episode has a "very cool" yet inconclusive cliffhanger that was not written to end the season; they compared it to "the end of an exciting book chapter [but] not the end of the novel." ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March, regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007–2008 season. After the strike's end on February 12, 2008, the writers pleaded with ABC to air "Meet Kevin Johnson" on April 17 with the second pod of episodes, due to "the eighth episode [being] non-traditional and the start of something new". <a href="Jorge%20Garcia">Jorge Garcia</a>, who plays <a href="Hugo%20%26quot%3BHurley%26quot%3B%20Reyes">Hurley Reyes</a>, agreed that "it's a pretty shocking end but it doesn't close out the way our previous [finales] have ended [because] it doesn't have that closure to it [and] ends in a sense of dissonance." ABC nevertheless prioritized scheduling "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>", "<a href="Ugly%20Betty">Ugly Betty</a>" and "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s returns all for April 24.

Despite the struggles with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer <a href="Adam%20Horowitz%20%28screenwriter%29">Adam Horowitz</a> recounted this as "a satisfying episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long to tell the story of what happened with Michael." Carlton Cuse stated that "we [the writers] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [Tom] finds him." Co-executive producer/staff writer <a href="Edward%20Kitsis">Edward Kitsis</a> added that "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [Michael] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of "Meet Kevin Johnson" are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after "<a href="Flashes%20Before%20Your%20Eyes">Flashes Before Your Eyes</a>" from the third season. The flashback portion of "Meet Kevin Johnson" is the longest in "Lost" history; Horowitz stated that "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other "Lost" characters, Damon Lindelof explained that "if the Others … had chosen … <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a> or … <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that "Kevin Johnson" was also the name of an <a href="Kevin%20Johnson">American basketball player</a>.

In "Meet Kevin Johnson", Michael visits Tom's penthouse suite, where Tom and his lover Arturo (Francesco Simone) are revealed to be homosexual—"Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s only gay characters. Online speculation about Tom's sexual orientation began after the broadcast of the <a href="A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Cities%20%28Lost%29">third-season premiere</a>, in which Tom tells <a href="Kate%20Austen">Kate Austen</a> (<a href="Evangeline%20Lilly">Evangeline Lilly</a>) that she is "not [his] type". A few weeks later, the writers hinted that a character would eventually be revealed as gay. In response to the internet community's suspicions, actor M.C. Gainey began to play the character as such, subtly trying to flirt with <a href="Jack%20Shephard">Jack Shephard</a> (<a href="Matthew%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Matthew Fox</a>) and later claiming that this attraction "got [him] through the first half of the season." Following the broadcast of "Meet Kevin Johnson", Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the line from the third-season premiere is an allusion to Tom's sexuality, but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in the show. Lindelof noted that "it was not subtle, to say the least". Edward "Eddy" Kitsis stated that "It was great to see [Tom] and realize that … he is a true gentleman." M.C. Gainey stated that "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer—that would be Tom" and Harold Perrineau rejoiced "Right on, I thought that was cool".

Tom establishes that the island has some control over whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that "It was interesting what [Tom] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." Later in the season, <a href="Martin%20Keamy">Martin Keamy</a> (<a href="Kevin%20Durand">Kevin Durand</a>) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, a manifestation of the island in the form of <a href="Christian%20Shephard">Christian Shephard</a> (<a href="John%20Terry%20%28actor%29">John Terry</a>) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's "cosmic intervention[s] of fate" also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the <a href="The%20Shape%20of%20Things%20to%20Come%20%28Lost%29">fourth midseason premiere</a>, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a[n] argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that "the island doesn't let you go until it's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well."

The second scene of the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men, who had attempted to leave the freighter. Gault's actor Grant Bowler explained that "it was a scene about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [on] the freighter … It was also about his ability to run the ship and that he was willing to go to such great lengths to keep order. It was about status, and keeping level-headed, and being in control."

Shooting commenced in early November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended the script for the next episode and freed the cast and crew from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming "Meet Kevin Johnson" than the average "Lost" episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the "" <a href="mobisode">mobisode</a>s directed by executive producer <a href="Jack%20Bender">Jack Bender</a> and one scene from the <a href="The%20Beginning%20of%20the%20End%20%28Lost%29">season premiere</a> overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew "busted [their] butts doing this one. It felt like we were making a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode". Lilly called it "one of the best episodes of the first eight."

The exterior freighter scenes were filmed on an actual freighter, while interior scenes were filmed both on sets and in the freighter. The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter's engine room; instead, they built a new engine room set based on that inside the freighter. It was "so stifling hot" at around and the crew found that "to get air conditioning down [t]here … was an impossible task", according to the "Kahana"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s real life chief engineer Bob Bower. Sculptor Jim Van Houten created twin twenty four foot (seven meter) marine engines for the set, primarily from urethane foam.

One New York flashback was filmed on the same <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> street that had been used by set decorator Carol Bayne Kelley as Berlin, Germany in the fourth season's "<a href="The%20Economist%20%28Lost%29">The Economist</a>" and London, England in the third season's "Flashes Before Your Eyes". The cliffhanger, in which Alex, Karl and Rousseau are in the jungle, was shot at Dillingham Ranch on the northwest tip of Oahu near the beach where the <a href="Pilot%20%28Lost%29">pilot</a> and other early episodes were primarily filmed. The scene originally ended with "snipers emerging through the jungle in these incredible, elaborate, jungle camouflage uniforms"; however, this was cut in post-production. Elements of this would be re-shot and used in the next episode when the snipers are identified.

Despite picketing on most days with his fellow "Lost" writers, Carlton Cuse, a member of the WGA negotiating committee, continued to oversee post-production in late November. When negotiations between the Guild and the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20and%20Television%20Producers">Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers</a> broke down in early December, he boycotted his producing duties on the show until the strike was resolved.

In addition to <a href="Michael%20Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>'s original <a href="Film%20score%23Television%20score">score</a>, "Meet Kevin Johnson" contained popular music <a href="diegesis">diegetically</a>. The song playing on Michael's car radio during his first suicide attempt is "It's Getting Better," performed by <a href="Cass%20Elliot">"Mama" Cass Elliot</a>. The song is heard again, fleetingly, during Michael's vision of Libby in the ship's engine room. Elliot's rendition of the song was released as a <a href="Single%20%28music%29">single</a> in 1969 and was included on her album "<a href="Bubblegum%2C%20Lemonade%2C%20and...%20Something%20for%20Mama">Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama</a>" later the same year. "Lost" previously played Elliot's "<a href="Make%20Your%20Own%20Kind%20of%20Music%20%28song%29">Make Your Own Kind of Music</a>" throughout the <a href="Lost%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>.

Dubbed "the most anticipated "Lost" [episode] of the season" by Verne Gay of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" due to Michael's flashbacks, "Meet Kevin Johnson" was watched live or recorded and watched within five hours of broadcast by 11.461 million viewers in the United States. Despite ranking ninth for the week in television programs with the most viewers, "Meet Kevin Johnson" set a new record as the lowest-rated episode in "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s history, although this title was taken two episodes later with the broadcast of "<a href="Something%20Nice%20Back%20Home">Something Nice Back Home</a>". "Meet Kevin Johnson" achieved a fifth-place 4.6/12 in the coveted adults aged eighteen to forty-nine demographic for the week. Including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, the episode was watched by a total of 13.386 million American viewers. 1.421 million Canadians watched "Meet Kevin Johnson", making "Lost" the eighth most-viewed show of the week. The episode brought in 618,000 viewers in Australia, placing it as the twenty-fourth most watched show of the night.

Critics and fans alike criticized the writers' seeming disregard for the "Lost" timeline. Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could deduce when parts of Michael's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island. John Kubicek of <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a> wrote that "This timeline results in some serious issues fans should have with time … This makes almost no sense … Michael left in the boat, he had to find help, come ashore, somehow explain himself, get on a plane back to New York City, drop off Walt to live with his grandma, find an apartment, get into a car accident, recover, and only then did he meet Tom. Either the writers are playing fast and loose with the concept of time, or Michael had the busiest week in the history of the world." Using <a href="Lostpedia">Lostpedia</a> as a reference, Nikki Stafford of "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" pointed out that the chronology was not only almost inconsistent with the third season, but also with an <a href="Confirmed%20Dead">earlier episode</a> of the same season. Damon Lindelof responded that "we [the writers and producers] find that the [fan message] boards can be really toxic" and pointed specifically to the "nitpick[ing]" of the possible continuity issues of "Meet Kevin Johnson", saying in defence of the script that "it's television."

The cliffhanger, in which Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation that she is Ben's daughter, gained a mixed response. In an 8.8 out of 10 review, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Chris Carabott called the scene "completely out of place … tacked on and anticlimactic" as it "came at the strangest moment". Jay Glatfelter of "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" deemed the cliffhanger "a shocker"; he asked "do we really care [about Karl's death]? I mean, he did have a nice new haircut and all, but he really wasn't too interesting of a character." Despite his assessment that "this impressive episode was a fitting midseason finale", <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>'s Ben Rawson-Jones wrote that the "climax wasn't as effective as one could have hoped for, as the collective fates of Alex, Danielle and the ultra-expendable Karl don't rouse a great deal of interest." Grading the episode as a "B", "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show's creative team to broadcast "Meet Kevin Johnson" as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale. Jensen criticized the episode's unique flashback format, commenting that it lacked the usual "deeper, more immersive experience [that] embellishes the sophistication of the storytelling" of "Lost".

"Meet Kevin Johnson" had a share of good reviews, with critics acclaiming the character development and emotional struggles of Michael. Alan Sepinwall of "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>" found this "middle chapter" to be "quite good" with "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's "struggle to deal with the guilt from his <a href="Faust">Faust</a>ian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to "Gay Tom" as "a unique and funny twist". Cynthia Littleton of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote that "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man trying to do the right thing, most of the time." In a four-out-of-five-star review, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones lauded the lack of interruption to the flashback and commented that "[Michael's] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Dan Compora of <a href="SyFy%20Portal">SyFy Portal</a> enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization of the rest of the main cast. In an overall positive review for the episode, "The Huffington Post"'s Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that "It seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character."

The episode was also subject to less favorable reviews from critics who were disappointed with the gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of "Time Out" "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called "Meet Kevin Johnson" "solid, but not spectacular" and gave it a grade of a "C+", writing that "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>'s Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more."

The <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a> granted sound production mixer Robert "Bobby" Anderson and re-recording mixers <a href="Frank%20Morrone">Frank Morrone</a> and Scott Weber a nomination for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Sound%20Mixing%20for%20a%20Comedy%20or%20Drama%20Series%20%28One-Hour%29">Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour)</a> for their work on this episode. On September 13, 2008, the nomination prevailed and became "Lost"s only Primetime Emmy Award win in <a href="60th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">2008</a>. Anderson discussed his job for an <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a> <a href="featurette">featurette</a> on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of "Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience". "Lost" is sometimes filmed just from the <a href="Kamehameha%20Highway">Kamehameha Highway</a> and the traffic noise drowns out filmed dialogue, as do the ocean waves, so Anderson has the actors <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">loop</a> their relatively quiet lines on an automated dialogue replacement (ADR) <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>.

Verdeja

Verdeja was the name of a series of <a href="light%20tank">light tank</a>s developed in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> between 1938 and 1954 in an attempt to replace German <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a> and Soviet <a href="T-26">T-26</a> tanks in <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish service</a>.

The program was headed by <a href="major">major</a> <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Verdeja%20Bardales">Félix Verdeja Bardales</a> and led to the development of four prototype vehicles, including a <a href="self-propelled%20howitzer">self-propelled howitzer</a> armed with a 75 millimeter (3 in) gun. It was designed as an advanced light tank and was one of the first development programs which took into account survivability of the crew as opposed to the protection of the tank itself. The tank was influenced by several of the light tanks which it was intended to replace, including the Panzer I and T-26, both of which were originally used during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The Verdeja was considered a superior tank to the T-26 after a lengthy testing period, yet was never put into mass production.

Three light tank prototypes were manufactured between 1938 and 1942, including the Verdeja 1 and the Verdeja 2. Interest in the vehicle's development waned after the end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Despite attempts to fit a new engine in the Verdeja 2 and convert the Verdeja 1 into a <a href="self-propelled%20artillery">self-propelled artillery</a> piece, ultimately the program was unofficially canceled in favor of adopting the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton Tank</a> in 1954. A prototype of the 75 millimetre self-propelled howitzer and of the Verdeja 2 were put on display in the early 1990s.

Spain received its first tank in mid-1919, a French <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a>, for testing purposes, and later received ten more tanks on 18 December 1921. The use of these tanks during the <a href="Rif%20War%20%281920%29">Rif War</a>, including the first amphibious landing with tanks, offered valuable experience for Spain's first indigenous armor program, the <a href="Trubia%20A4">Trubia A4</a>. The Trubia tank program, based on the FT, led to the development of four prototypes, but ultimately the program failed due to lack of interest from the national government. These prototypes influenced a subsequent indigenous attempt to produce a tank, named the Trubia-Naval. This design also failed to get past the prototype type stage. Due to the failure of Spanish efforts to produce a tank, and the ineffective attempts to procure foreign designs such as the Italian <a href="Fiat%203000">Fiat 3000</a>, by the start of the Spanish Civil War there were only ten working FT light tanks available in the country.

The lack of armor prompted the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> to supply the <a href="Popular%20Front%20%28Spain%29">Popular Front</a> and <a href="Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="Italy">Italy</a> to supply the <a href="Nationalist%20Spain">Nationalist Front</a> with light tanks. Between 1936 and 1939, the Germans provided the Nationalists with 122 Panzer Is and the Italians provided 155 <a href="L3/35">L-3-35s</a>. Meanwhile, the Soviets issued Republican Spain 281 <a href="T-26">T-26</a>s and 50 <a href="BT-5">BT-5</a>s. The Nationalists quickly found out the light machine guns on their tanks could not penetrate the T-26's armor at over , and Republican tankers could routinely knock out Panzer Is and L-3-35s at ranges of up to . In order to re-equip Nationalist armored forces with the T-26, German Major <a href="Ritter%20von%20Thoma">Ritter von Thoma</a> offered Spanish troops 500 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">"peseta"</a>s for each tank captured. There were also attempts to up-gun the Panzer I with an Italian <a href="Breda">Breda</a> 20 millimetre Model 1935 anti-aircraft gun, due to its high <a href="Muzzle%20velocity">Muzzle velocity</a> and low recoil. Despite four successfully converted vehicles, designated Panzer I "Breda", there was no widespread program to retrofit the gun into the Panzer I. Instead, the Nationalists began to press captured T-26s into service against their previous owners, with the first Nationalist T-26 unit formed in June 1937.

On 6 September 1937, Captain Félix Verdeja, commanding the maintenance company of the Nationalist "Batallón de Carros de Combate" ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately develop a new light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45 millimetre (1.77 in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15 millimetres (0.6 in), with a turret <a href="mantlet">mantlet</a> plate of at least 30 millimetres (1.2 in); road speed of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra, commanding officer of the "Agrupación de Carros de Combate". Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype due to a lack of resources and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> to continue with the construction of the prototype. 

The prototype was manufactured from spare parts and equipment scavenged from other light tanks, and featured a rectangular turret with 16 millimetre (0.6 in) basic armor. The chassis was divided into four quarters, with the forward right half occupied by the engine, gear box, clutch and final drive, beside the driver. The rear half of the vehicle was taken up mostly by the turret basket and forty-six 45 millimetre rounds, as well as two 60 liter (13 Imp gal) fuel tanks. Turret space was used by the tank commander-gunner and the loader, as well as the 45 millimetre model 1932 anti-tank gun and two <a href="MG-13">MG-13</a> machine guns. The main gun was originally commissioned as the Soviet 45 millimetre 19K anti-tank gun in March 1932, and featured heavier ammunition and a faster rate of fire than older anti-tank guns. Starting in 1934, a newer model began to be fitted into newly assembled T-26s. Apart from the gun, the tank commander's model 1932 panoramic periscope was also scavenged from a T-26. The vehicle was powered by a <a href="Ford">Ford</a> <a href="Ford%20Flathead%20engine%23221">Model 48</a> engine taken from a civilian automobile, displacing 3,622 cc (221 in) and producing 85 hp (63 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The engine was paired with a brand-new radiator and exhaust system. The Verdeja prototype used the Panzer I's Aphon PG-31 gearbox, although this worked at excessive revolutions for the engine, offering less torque which made slopes greater than 40° difficult. Possibly the most unusual features of the Verdeja were the suspension and tracks. To prevent the tank's tracks slipping off the roadwheels, two track pieces were fitted together to create a central groove for the roadwheel to travel in. With a weight of under the Verdeja had a maximum speed of and a combat radius of . Following the prototype's success in testing between 10 January and 20 January 1939, Captain Verdeja was ordered to begin construction of the definitive model of the light tank.

The appearance of the resulting Verdeja 1 prototype was close to that originally envisioned in Captain Verdeja's first designs. The vehicle's hull was elongated and the rear plate sloped, while the fuel capacity—and thus combat range—was increased, as was the ammunition capacity and the thickness of the armor. The vehicle was fabricated in <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>, the only city in Spain with a heavy vehicle assembly line. Due to the end of the Spanish Civil War and a shortage of funds, construction was postponed until May 1940. The prototype was completed three months later and delivered to the proving grounds in Carabanchel, Madrid, powered with basically the same <a href="Ford%20flathead%20V8%20engine">Ford flathead V8 engine</a> also used as the motive power of the three-tonne weight British <a href="Universal%20Carrier">Universal Carrier</a>. A major external difference between the previous model and this prototype was the new, low-profile turret which allowed the 45 millimetre gun to depress and elevate from 8° to 70°. The original 45 millimetre model 1932 gun was exchanged with a new 45 millimetre Mark I tank gun fabricated by S.A. Placencia de las Armas, in Spain. However, the new prototype adopted the suspension and tracks from the original prototype. In essence, the main advantages of the new prototype were its low-profile, high elevation of the main gun and the increased sloping of the armor from 12° to 45°. It should be noted that the Verdeja 1 retained the original configuration by placing the engine in the front, to increase crew survivability.

On arrival at Carabanchel, the vehicle was tested against the T-26 in mobility over different terrain types and in firepower. The vehicles were graded based upon a five-point scale for each test, which would be multiplied by a coefficient of importance for each test. During the testing the Verdeja traveled for some 500 kilometres (300 mi) without any maintenance problems, the only issue being the large consumption of water by the gasoline engine, due to the lack of an efficient radiator, and the loss of a rubber liner of one of the roadwheels. It was found that the maximum velocity of the Verdeja was either on par with similar vehicles in foreign service or superior, while the Verdeja proved itself capable of going over trenches almost 2 m wide and climbing slopes of 40°. In terms of armament, it was proved that the vehicle could withstand the recoil of the 45 millimetre high-velocity tank gun. One of the vehicle's disadvantages was that the tank commander's aiming device was designed for a 37 millimetre anti-tank cannon, adapted into the Verdeja due to the lack of time to manufacture one for the 45 millimetre Mark I. Testing concluded with the Verdeja receiving a total of 243 points, compared to the 205 points awarded to the T-26B. Testing completed, the prototype was returned and several problems were fixed, including engine deficiencies, the elevation of the sprocket and an increase to 10 millimetre of armor on all areas that had less. These changes made, the Verdeja returned to testing, this time scoring 261.98 points.

Plans to produce one thousand Verdeja tanks were approved on 2 December 1940, divided into ten batches of one hundred tanks each. The Verdeja production prototype was to adopt the 120 horsepower (89 kW) <a href="Lincoln-Zephyr">Lincoln-Zephyr</a> gasoline <a href="Lincoln-Zephyr%20V12%20engine">V12</a> engine, requiring a contract between the Spanish government and Ford Motor Ibérica, Ford's Spanish subsidiary. Simultaneously, in case of failure of talks between Ford and Spain, the government also began to contact a number of German companies, including <a href="Maybach">Maybach</a>. In order to begin production, the Tank Workshop in Zaragoza was to be expanded to allow final assembly of at least five tanks per month. Despite funding and two years of construction allotted, the factory construction and expansion was never completed. Other problems arose, including the failure to reach an agreement with Ford or Maybach. These factors, the poor economic situation in Spain, the lack of clients other than the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Army</a> and the lack of incentives for Spanish companies to partake in the construction program, led to the abandonment of the attempt to fabricate the Verdeja 1. Another attempt was undertaken at contracting the ADESA ("Armamento de Aviación, S.A.") company, to manufacture two Verdeja light tanks for experimental purposes. Despite the failure to procure an engine, ADESA offered to construct 300 units, but these attempts failed and the program was abandoned by 1941.

As the Verdeja 1 program dissolved, Captain Verdeja began to design a successor taking into consideration lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War. The new design featured a redesigned engine bay at the rear of the chassis, which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well. The movement of the engine's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle's motor and the fighting compartment, as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward. The vehicle's armor was also increased substantially by between five and ten millimetres. This new tank was not approved for production or further development due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV's engine for the Verdeja 1. Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942, it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja 2 prototype was delivered. The program was delayed by the incorporation of twenty <a href="Panzer%20IV%23Ausf.%20G%20to%20Ausf.%20J">Panzer IV Ausf. H's</a> and ten <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">Sturmgeschütz III</a>s into the Spanish Army in late 1943, as well as failed attempts to procure one hundred more Panzer IVs and even <a href="Panther%20tank">Panthers</a> and <a href="Tiger%20I">Tigers</a> during 1944. With these new vehicles integrated into the army and the fiscal problems which plagued the Verdeja 1, the Verdeja 2 remained unimproved until 1950, when there was an attempt to fit a <a href="Pegaso">Pegaso</a> Z-202 engine. Despite this, the Verdeja remained on factory grounds until 1973, when it was transferred to the Infantry Academy of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo</a>.

Between the late 1940s and early 1950s there were a number of programs in Spain to develop a self-propelled <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> based on an existing chassis. For example, during the early 1950s, Spanish engineers attempted to retrofit a R-43 105-millimeter (4.1 in) <a href="caliber%23Caliber%20as%20measurement%20of%20length">L/26</a> howitzer into a <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">StuG III</a>. This required reconstruction of the turret's casemate, in a fashion similar to the Verdeja 75-millimeter self-propelled howitzer. Although one vehicle began conversion, the program was never finalized. There were similar programs to fit an 88-millimeter L/56 and a 122-millimeter L/46 howitzer thereafter, but these did not advance beyond the planning stage, either. One of the most successful programs was the attempt to produce a 75-millimeter self-propelled howitzer based on the chassis of the Verdeja 1 prototype. Beginning in 1945,  now-Major Verdeja was ordered to begin designing this piece using a rapid-firing 75-millimeter L/40 howitzer designed by <a href="Navantia">"Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval"</a>. The availability of the required parts and the lack of complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively. The fate of the self-propelled piece was much the same as that of the Verdeja 2, and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base "Alfonso XIII", housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment "Wad Rass nº 55". It was soon moved to another base, and finally delivered to the base of "El Goloso", outside of Madrid, as a part of an armored vehicles museum.

Major changes to the original Verdeja 1 included removing the turret and replacing it with a gun shield with 10 millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty <a href="caliber">caliber</a>s. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield on each side of the breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a <a href="3.7%20cm%20PaK%2036">PaK 36</a> <a href="Anti-tank%20warfare%23Anti-tank%20guns">anti-tank gun</a>. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical <a href="brake">brake</a> built into the <a href="idler-wheel">idler-wheel</a> to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.

Ultimately the Verdeja program's end came with the arrival of military equipment from the United States, beginning in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks, replacing the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service. The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger, more potent tanks such as the German <a href="Panther%20tank">Panther</a>, the Soviet <a href="T-54">T-54</a> and the US M47. The T-54 had 200 millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet, far greater than the Verdeja 2's maximum armor thickness of 40 millimetres. The Soviet 45 millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the <a href="T-34">T-34's</a> <a href="F-34%20tank%20gun">76.2 millimetre gun</a>, while the Germans adopted the <a href="7.5%20cm%20KwK%2042">75 millimetre L/70 tank gun</a> on the Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks such as the T-54 were armed with the <a href="D-10%20tank%20gun">D-10T 100 millimetre tank gun</a>, and American tanks adopted the <a href="90%20mm%20gun">90 millimetre main gun</a>. Although the Verdeja was Spain's most successful indigenous design, it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products. Furthermore, the need for self-propelled artillery was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain <a href="M24%20Chaffee%23Variants">M37</a> and M44 self-propelled howitzers. As a result, interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954. Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a> main battle tank in the late 1980s.

HMS Calliope (1884)

HMS "Calliope" was a (later classified as a <a href="cruiser">third-class cruiser</a>) of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> which served from 1887 until 1951. Exemplifying the transitional nature of the late Victorian navy, "Calliope" was a sailing corvette – last such ship built for the Royal Navy – but supplemented the full sail rig with a powerful engine. Steel was used for the hull, and like the earlier iron-hulled corvettes, "Calliope" was cased with timber and coppered below the waterline, in the same manner as wooden ships.

"Calliope" was known for "one of the most famous episodes of seamanship in the 19th century", when the vessel was the only ship present to avoid being sunk or stranded in the <a href="1889%20Apia%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that struck <a href="Apia">Apia</a>, <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> in 1889. After retirement from active service, "Calliope" served as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> until 1951, when the old corvette was sold for <a href="Ship%20breaking">breaking</a>.

"Calliope" and <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> comprised the "Calypso" class of corvettes designed by <a href="Nathaniel%20Barnaby">Nathaniel Barnaby</a>. Part of a long line of cruiser classes built for protecting trade routes and colonial police work, they were the last two sailing corvettes built for the Royal Navy. Corvettes had been built of iron since the of 1867, but the "Calypso"s and the preceding were instead built of steel. Corvettes were designed to operate across the vast distances of Britain's maritime empire, and could not rely on dry docks for maintenance. Since iron (and steel) hulls were subject to <a href="biofouling">biofouling</a>, and they could not easily be cleaned, the established practice of <a href="copper%20sheathing">copper sheathing</a> was extended to protect them; the metal plating of the hull was timber-cased and coppered below the waterline. The only armour was a 1.5-inch (38-mm) armoured deck covering the machinery spaces, but coal bunkers along the sides gave some protection to the machinery spaces.

"Calypso" and "Calliope" differed from their nine predecessors of the "Comus" class in armament; they were also slightly longer, had a deeper <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a>, and displaced 390 tons more. Originally planned as a ten-gun corvette, "Calliope" was completed with four <a href="BL%206%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Binch%20gun%20Mk%20II%20%E2%80%93%20VI">breechloaders</a> in <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s fore and aft on each side, twelve <a href="BL%205%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Binch%20gun%20Mk%20I%20-%20V">breechloaders</a> in <a href="broadside">broadside</a> between the 6-inch guns, and six quick-firing <a href="Nordenfelt%20gun">Nordenfelts</a>.

The compound-expansion steam engine was supplied with steam by six boilers and developed . This was 50% more powerful than the predecessor class, which gave the corvette one more <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knot</a> of speed, a difference that would be crucial in the disaster that made "Calliope" famous. The engine drove a single feathering screw, and enabled the vessel to reach a speed of 13¾ knots, or 14¾ knots with forced draught. The vessel nevertheless was a <a href="full%20rigged%20ship">fully rigged sailing ship</a>, allowing sustained service in areas where coaling stations were far apart. "Calliope" was well-suited to distant cruising service for the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> at its <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> peak.

Although laid down in 1881, "Calliope" was not launched until 1884, and was placed in reserve at <a href="Portsmouth%20Dockyard">Portsmouth</a> before completion. The ship was not activated until 25 January 1887, when the vessel was placed in commission for the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>, the sort of distant service for which the class had been designed. The same year, all corvettes and frigates were re-classified as "cruisers", with "Calliope" and "Calypso" falling into the "third-class cruiser" category.

The British Empire was the largest on Earth, and Britain protected that empire and its trade routes with the world's largest navy. Great Britain assumed the role of peacekeeper on the world's oceans, and the Royal Navy was the instrument by which the "<a href="Pax%20Britannica">Pax Britannica</a>" was kept. The global reach of the Royal Navy included the western Pacific Ocean, patrolled by the Australia Station. In 1887 Captain <a href="Henry%20Coey%20Kane">Henry Coey Kane</a> took "Calliope" to the Pacific. At first assigned to the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>, the vessel was reassigned to the Australia Station later in 1887. The cruiser was in New Zealand at the end of that year, and was the first vessel to enter the new <a href="Calliope%20Dock">Calliope Dock</a>. In early 1888 "Calliope" was sent north to watch over a looming diplomatic crisis and potential military confrontation in <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>.

This crisis had its roots in the <a href="Great%20Power">Great Power</a>s' competition for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, invigorated by its victory over <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">France</a> in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> and by its <a href="Unification%20of%20Germany">unification</a> under the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian monarchy</a>, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had shared in the <a href="scramble%20for%20Africa">division of Africa</a>, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Imperial Navy</a> were sent to <a href="Apia">Apia</a> in Samoa, where German agents had fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the <a href="Asiatic%20Squadron">Asiatic Squadron</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on the North American continent, leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific and to watch the Germans.
In March 1889, the new corvette "Calliope"—sent to keep the peace and protect Britain's interests in Samoa—joined the competing squadrons of the Imperial German and United States navies at Apia. The harbour there was primitive, small and nearly surrounded by reefs. Perhaps fit for four ships, the anchorage held seven warships and six merchant vessels on 14 March.

The barometer began to fall that day and a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> began to form. The <a href="1889%20Apia%20cyclone">1889 Apia cyclone</a> increased in ferocity over the next two days. Rain fell in sheets, cutting visibility. Winds of 70 to 100 knots (130–185 km/h, 80-115 mph) blew directly into the anchorage, trapping the ships in the V-shaped harbour. The harbour bottom was scoured by currents and anchors lost their purchase. Operating their engines at full speed to resist the wind and waves, ships nevertheless dragged their anchors and were inexorably driven landward. Vessels collided and were thrown on the reefs or ashore, and some sank. By 09:00 on the 16th, "Calliope", although still riding at anchor, had been hit by one ship and narrowly missed by another, and Captain Kane decided to attempt to escape. To relieve the strain on the five anchor cables, "Calliope"s boilers were producing maximum pressure; the engines were being worked "red hot", and the propeller was making 74 <a href="revolutions%20per%20minute">revolutions per minute</a>, sufficient for 15 knots (28 km/h) in calmer waters. In spite of this titanic effort, the ship was barely able to make headway against the winds and the seas in the harbour, and anchor cables began to part.

To port and only 20 feet (6 m) away was the coral reef. Ahead were the US ships and ; to starboard were other warships. There was only a narrow opening between the vessels to one side and the ground to the other. Hemmed in by these obstacles and with the rudder at times within 6 feet (2 m) of the reef, "Calliope" manoeuvred while still attached to the anchor cables, which began to give way. When Captain Kane saw an opening, he slipped the anchors and drove forward. Avoiding the helpless "Vandalia", he approached the sinking "Trenton", coming so close that "Calliope"s fore yard-arm passed over the American's deck. As "Calliope" rolled to port, the yard lifted over "Trenton". The crew of the helpless and doomed American ship cheered "Calliope" as the corvette slipped past. The British ship's drive for the open sea was called by the American commander on the scene "one of the grandest sights a seaman or anyone else ever saw; the lives of 250 souls depended on the hazardous adventure."

Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow and stern alternately rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from <a href="Overspeed%20%28engine%29">running away</a> to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running the length of the deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling <a href="relieving%20tackle">relieving tackle</a> on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four <a href="Cable%20length">cables</a>, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to "Calliope"s crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.

The storm kept "Calliope" at sea the next two days. Re-entering the harbour on 19 March to search for the missing anchors, the crew discovered that all of the other ships—twelve in all—had been wrecked or sunk, and nearly every crew had been diminished by the loss of men killed by the storm. Unable to find the anchor amidst the wreckage, and his ship having sustained significant damage, Captain Kane decided to return to Australia. He turned over "Calliope"s diving outfit to the US Navy to assist it in salvage, and received in return boats from the wrecked American ships to replace the boats which had been stripped from "Calliope" by the storm.

Captain Kane then took his ship to Sydney, where they received a hero's welcome. The narrowness of "Calliope"s escape; the excellence of the engines and the dedication of the crew, who kept the power plant in operation for many hours during the ordeal; the seamanship of Captain Kane and officers; their bravery in letting go of their anchor and facing the storm, trusting only in their ship and themselves; and the respect and encouragement given to them by the crew of "Trenton"; made "Calliope" famous.

The engineer of "Calliope", Henry George Bourke, was specially promoted from staff engineer to fleet engineer on 28 May 1889, "for his services in Her Majesty's ship 'Calliope,' during the recent hurricane at Samoa." He attributed his success to the superior properties of West Coast coal from New Zealand used to fire the ship's boilers; this statement attracted the custom of the British Admiralty when fuelling its ships in those waters.

Captain Kane was made <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the <a href="1891%20Birthday%20Honours">1891 Queen's Birthday Honours</a>. He was cited by the Admiralty for his "nerve and decisions", given the command of in 1892, and in 1897 was promoted to <a href="Rear-Admiral%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">rear-admiral</a>.

"Calliope" returned to service on the Australian station after repairs were complete. At the end of 1889 the cruiser was recalled to the United Kingdom.

Arriving back home in early 1890, "Calliope" was placed in reserve and remained there for the next seven years. In June 1897 the cruiser was present at <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>'s <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> <a href="Fleet%20Review">Review of the Fleet</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. That same year "Calliope" became a tender to , an older and larger <a href="armored%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> used as seagoing training ship for boys. "Calliope" also was occasionally used as a training cruiser, and toured the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> from February to April in 1900 under Captain Henry Peter Routh, and again in March 1901, and March 1902. During the summer 1902 she undertook a training cruise in home waters May–June 1902 under the command of Captain Erasmus D. St. A. Ommanney, visiting <a href="Campbeltown">Campbeltown</a>, <a href="Belfast%20Lough">Belfast Lough</a>, <a href="Portishead%2C%20Somerset">Portishead</a>, <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a>, <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> and <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>.

Relieved of tender duty in 1905, "Calliope" was returned to reserve and promptly stricken from the effective list. The cruiser laid up at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, and in 1906 was listed for sale for a time. The next year "Calliope" was moved to <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a> for a new career.

On 29 October 1907 "Calliope" became a drill ship at <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> for the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve</a>, Tyne Division, and served there for over four decades. The cruiser surrendered the name "Calliope" to a between 1915 and 1931, and became "Helicon". After the newer was paid off in the 1930s, "Helicon" reverted to "Calliope" and retained that name until sold in 1951. When finally scrapped in 1953, the steering wheel was presented to the government of Western Samoa. The mahogany panelling from the officers' wardroom was reclaimed in 1953 and now forms the wings to the 18th century organ in the west gallery of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20North%20Shields">Christ Church, North Shields</a>, Tyne and Wear.

The Open Boat

"The Open Boat" is a <a href="short%20story">short story</a> by American author <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a> (1871–1900). First published in 1897, it was based on Crane's experience of surviving a shipwreck off the coast of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> earlier that year while traveling to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> to work as a newspaper correspondent. Crane was stranded at sea for thirty hours when his ship, the <a href="Commodore%20%28shipwreck%29">SS "Commodore"</a>, sank after hitting a sandbar. He and three other men were forced to navigate their way to shore in a small boat; one of the men, an <a href="Oiler%20%28occupation%29">oiler</a> named Billie Higgins, drowned after the boat overturned. Crane's personal account of the shipwreck and the men's survival, titled "Stephen Crane's Own Story", was first published a few days after his rescue.

Crane subsequently adapted his report into narrative form, and the resulting short story "The Open Boat" was published in "<a href="Scribner%27s%20Magazine">Scribner's Magazine</a>". The story is told from the point of view of an anonymous correspondent, with Crane as the implied author, the action closely resembles the author's experiences after the shipwreck. A volume titled "The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure" was published in the United States in 1898; an edition entitled "The Open Boat and Other Stories" was published simultaneously in England. Praised for its innovation by contemporary critics, the story is considered an exemplary work of <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">literary Naturalism</a>, and is one of the most frequently discussed works in Crane's canon. It is notable for its use of imagery, irony, symbolism, and the exploration of such themes as survival, solidarity, and the conflict between man and nature. <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> considered "The Open Boat" to be "beyond all question, the crown of all [Crane's] work".

Hired by the <a href="Irving%20Bacheller">Bacheller newspaper syndicate</a> to serve as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> during the <a href="Cuban%20War%20of%20Independence">Cuban insurrection</a> against Spain, the 25-year-old Stephen Crane boarded the <a href="filibuster%20%28military%29">filibustering</a> steamship "SS Commodore" on New Year's Eve, 1896. The ship sailed from <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, with 27 or 28 men and a cargo of supplies and ammunition for the Cuban rebels. On the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River">St. Johns River</a>, less than from Jacksonville, "Commodore" struck a <a href="shoal">sandbar</a> in a dense fog and damaged its hull. Although towed off the sandbar the following day, it was again beached in <a href="Mayport">Mayport</a>, Florida, and further damaged. A leak began in the boiler room that evening, and as a result of malfunctioning water pumps, the ship came to a standstill about from Mosquito Inlet (now called <a href="Ponce%20de%20Le%C3%B3n%20Inlet">Ponce de León Inlet</a>). As the ship took on more water, Crane described the engine room as resembling "a scene at this time taken from the middle kitchen of <a href="Hades">Hades</a>."

"Commodore"'s lifeboats were lowered in the early hours of the morning on January 2, 1897, and the ship sank at 7 a.m. Crane was one of the last to leave the ship in a <a href="dinghy">dinghy</a>. He and three other men (including the captain, Edward Murphy) floundered off the coast of Florida for a day and a half before attempting to land their craft at <a href="Daytona%20Beach">Daytona Beach</a>. The small boat, however, overturned in the surf, forcing the exhausted men to swim to shore; one of them, an <a href="oiler%20%28occupation%29">oiler</a> named Billie Higgins, died. The disaster was front-page news in newspapers across the country; rumors that the ship had been sabotaged were widely circulated but never substantiated.

Crane was reunited with his partner, <a href="Cora%20Crane">Cora</a>, several days after the ordeal, and quickly wrote his initial report of the sinking while waiting in Jacksonville for another ship. Desperate for work, he soon left for New York to secure a job covering the impending <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish War</a>. Crane completed the story that would become "The Open Boat" a few weeks later, in mid-February. According to fellow correspondent <a href="Ralph%20D.%20Paine">Ralph D. Paine</a>, Crane had the opportunity to show the first draft of the short story to Murphy when Crane again passed through Jacksonville. When Crane asked his opinion, Murphy allegedly replied, "You've got it, Steve ... That is just how it happened, and how we felt. Read me some more of it".

Crane's report of the incident appeared on the front page of the "<a href="New%20York%20Press">New York Press</a>" on January 7, 1897, only three days after his rescue, and was quickly reprinted in various other papers. The account, titled "Stephen Crane's Own Story", concentrates mainly on the sinking of the "Commodore", and the ensuing chaos. Crane dedicates just two paragraphs to the fate of his compatriots and himself on the dinghy, while detailing their inability to save those stranded on the sinking ship:

The cook let go of the line. We rowed around to see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were suddenly swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.

The report caused a sensation and spurred the author to write a narrative version of the events. The short story first appeared in the June 1897 issue of "Scribner's Magazine". A second and lesser story, "", based upon the same shipwreck but told from the point of view of the captain, was published in "McClure's Magazine" in October 1897. "The Open Boat" was published in the United States by Doubleday & McClure in April 1898 as part of the book "The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure", which included additional works by Crane such as "<a href="The%20Bride%20Comes%20to%20Yellow%20Sky">The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky</a>", "Death and the Child", and "The Wise Men". The English volume, published simultaneously with the American one, was titled "The Open Boat and Other Stories" and published by William Heinemann. Both editions included the subtitle "A Tale Intended to Be after the Fact. Being the Experience of Four Men from the Sunk Steamer 'Commodore' ", and were dedicated "To the late William Higgins and to Captain Edward Murphy and Steward C. B. Montgomery of the Sunk Steamer Commodore".

None of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.

"The Open Boat" is divided into seven sections, each told mainly from the <a href="narrative%20mode">point of view</a> of the correspondent, based upon Crane himself. The first part introduces the four characters—"the correspondent", a condescending observer detached from the rest of the group; "the captain", who is injured and morose at having lost his ship, yet capable of leadership; "the cook", fat and comical, but optimistic that they will be rescued; and "the oiler", Billie, who is physically the strongest, and the only one in the story referred to by name. The four are survivors of a shipwreck, which occurred before the beginning of the story, and are drifting at sea in a small dinghy.

In the following four sections, the moods of the men fluctuate from anger at their desperate situation, to a growing empathy for one another and the sudden realization that nature is indifferent to their fates. The men become fatigued and bicker with one another; nevertheless, the oiler and the correspondent take turns rowing toward shore, while the cook bails water to keep the boat afloat. When they see a <a href="Ponce%20de%20Leon%20Inlet%20Light">lighthouse</a> on the horizon, their hope is tempered with the realization of the danger of trying to reach it. Their hopes dwindle further when, after seeing a man waving from shore, and what may or may not be another boat, they fail to make contact. The correspondent and the oiler continue to take turns rowing, while the others sleep fitfully during the night. The correspondent then notices a shark swimming near the boat, but he does not seem to be bothered by it as one would expect. In the penultimate chapter, the correspondent wearily recalls a verse from the poem "Bingen on the Rhine" by <a href="Caroline%20Norton">Caroline Norton</a>, in which a "soldier of the Legion" dies far from home.

The final chapter begins with the men's resolution to abandon the floundering dinghy they have occupied for thirty hours and to swim ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able to swim on. After three of the men safely reach the shore and are met by a group of rescuers, they find Billie dead, his body washed up on the beach.

Although autobiographical in nature, "The Open Boat" is a work of fiction; it is often considered a principal example of <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">Naturalism</a>, an offshoot of the <a href="Realism%20%28literature%29">Realist</a> literary movement, in which scientific principles of objectivity and detachment are applied to the study of human characteristics. While a majority of critics agree that the story acts as a <a href="paradigm">paradigm</a> of the human situation, they disagree as to its precise nature. Some believe the story affirms man's place in the world by concentrating on the characters' isolation, while others—including those who call "The Open Boat" ideologically <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a>—insist that the story questions man's place in the universe through metaphorical or indirect means.

Like other major works by Stephen Crane, "The Open Boat" contains numerous examples of symbolism, <a href="Imagery%20%28literature%29">imagery</a> and <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>. Vibrant descriptions of color, combined with simple, clear writing, are also apparent throughout, and humor in the form of irony serves in stark opposition to the dreary setting and desperate characters. Editor <a href="Vincent%20Starrett">Vincent Starrett</a> stated in his introduction to the 1921 collection of Crane's work entitled "Men, Women and Boats" that the author keeps "down the tone where another writer might have attempted 'fine writing' and have been lost." Other critics have noted similarities between the story and shipwreck-related articles Crane wrote while working as a reporter for the "New York Tribune" earlier in his career. Articles such as "The Wreck of the "New Era"", which describes a group of castaways drowning in sight of a helpless crowd, and "Ghosts on the Jersey Coast" contain stark imagery that strongly prefigures that of "The Open Boat".

Similar to other Naturalist works, "The Open Boat" scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. The struggle between man and the natural world is the most apparent theme in the work, and while the characters at first believe the turbulent sea to be a hostile force set against them, they come to believe that nature is instead ambivalent. At the beginning of the last section, the correspondent rethinks his view of nature's hostility: "the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual—nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to him, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent." The correspondent regularly refers to the sea with feminine pronouns, pitting the four men in the boat against an intangible, yet effeminate, threat; critic Leedice Kissane further pointed to the story's seeming denigration of women, noting the castaways' personification of Fate as "an old ninny-woman" and "an old hen". That nature is ultimately disinterested is an idea that appears in other works by Crane; a poem from Crane's 1899 collection "<a href="War%20is%20Kind%20and%20Other%20Lines">War is Kind and Other Lines</a>" also echoes Crane's common theme of universal indifference:

A man said to the universe:<br>
"Sir, I exist!" <br>
"However," replied the universe, <br>
"The fact has not created in me <br>
A sense of obligation."

The <a href="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> conflicts born from man's isolation are also important themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection. The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, as well as his inability to blame God for his misfortunes, musing: "When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply that there are no bricks and no temples." Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things "seemed" or "appeared", leaving how a thing actually "was" entirely ambiguous. Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—"None of them knew the color of the sky"—as one that sets the scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.

Chester Wolford noted in his critical analysis of Crane's short fiction that although one of the author's most familiar themes deals with a character's seeming insignificance in an indifferent universe, the correspondent's experience in "The Open Boat" is perhaps more personal than what was described in earlier stories because of Crane's obvious connection to the story. Sergio Perosa similarly described how Crane "transfigures an actual occurrence into existential drama, and confers universal meaning and poetic value on the simple retelling of man's struggle for survival".

Facing an ultimately detached nature, the characters find solace in human solidarity. They are often referred to collectively as "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: "It would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.

In his 1990 book "Sea-Brothers: The Tradition of American Sea Fiction from Moby-Dick to the Present", author Bert Bender noted Crane's sympathetic portrayal of the oiler Billie, the most physically able of the four characters, and yet the only one to perish. The correspondent even notes with wonder Billie's exceptional ability to row despite having worked a double shift before the ship sank. Bender wrote that Crane "emphasizes that Billie's steady, simple labor is the tangible basis for his role here as a savior," and that the oiler's portrayal as a "simple, working seaman, clearly expresses his sympathy with the democratic ideal of the sailor before the mast that figures so crucially in the tradition of American sea fiction." That Billie does not survive the ordeal, however, can be seen as an antithesis to <a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> in that the only person to not survive was in fact the strongest physically.
"The Open Boat" directly references <a href="Caroline%20Norton">Lady Caroline Norton</a>'s 1883 poem "Bingen on the Rhine", which focuses on the death of a <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>naire, far from home, while grasping the hand of a comrade. Recalling the poem, the correspondent sees how the soldier's dire circumstances mirror his own, leading him to feel sorry for the anonymous poetic figure; noting the similarities between the dying soldier and the shipwrecked correspondent, critics such as Edward Stone and Max Westbrook believe this realization causes the correspondent to discover the necessity for human sympathy in an uncaring world. While the literary reference may be considered ironic, unsympathetic, and only of minor interest, Stone for one argued that this poem may also have served as a source for "The Red Badge of Courage", which also explores man's relationship with the metaphysical.

"The Open Boat" is one of the most frequently discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized. <a href="Wilson%20Follett">Wilson Follett</a> included the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volume "Stephen Crane: An Omnibus". The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalist <a href="Harold%20Frederic">Harold Frederic</a> wrote in his review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that "even if he had written nothing else, ["The Open Boat" would] have placed [Crane] where he now undoubtedly stands." English poet <a href="Robert%20Bridges">Robert Bridges</a> likewise praised the story in his review for "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>", stating that Crane "has indelibly fixed the experience on your mind, and that is the test of a literary artisan". American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New York "Evening Sun" that "those who have read 'The Open Boat' will forget every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the egg-shell changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group".

After Crane's premature death from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at the age of 28, his work enjoyed a resurgence of popularity. Author and critic <a href="Elbert%20Hubbard">Elbert Hubbard</a> wrote in Crane's obituary in the "Philistine" that "The Open Boat" was "the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned". Also noting the depressing Realism utilized in the story, editor Vincent Starrett stated: "It is a desolate picture, and the tale is one of our greatest short stories." Another of the author's friends, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, wrote that "The Open Boat" was "beyond all question, the crown of all [Crane's] work." Singling out Crane's usage of color and <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> in his writing, Wells continued: "It has all the stark power of the earlier stories, with a new element of restraint; the color is as full and strong as ever, fuller and stronger, indeed; but those chromatic splashes that at times deafen and confuse in "The Red Badge", those images that astonish rather than enlighten, are disciplined and controlled." The story remains popular with critics; Thomas Kent referred to "The Open Boat" as Crane's "magnum opus", while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it "Crane's finest short story and one of the masterworks of late nineteenth-century American literature".

Droxford railway station

Droxford railway station was a small station on the <a href="Meon%20Valley%20Railway">Meon Valley Railway</a>, built to a design by <a href="T.%20P.%20Figgis">T. P. Figgis</a> and opened in 1903. It served the villages of <a href="Droxford">Droxford</a>, <a href="Soberton">Soberton</a> and <a href="Hambledon%2C%20Hampshire">Hambledon</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England. The railway served a relatively lightly populated area, but was built to <a href="Main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> specifications in anticipation of it becoming a major route to <a href="Gosport">Gosport</a>. Consequently, although the station was built in an area with only five houses, it was designed with the capacity to handle 10-carriage trains. It initially proved successful both for the transport of goods and passengers, but services were reduced during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and the <a href="Post%E2%80%93World%20War%20I%20recession">subsequent recession</a>, and the route suffered owing to competition from road transport.

In 1944 Droxford station was used by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> as his base during preparations for the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. Based in an armoured train parked in the <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">sidings</a> at Droxford, Churchill met with numerous ministers, military commanders and leaders of allied nations. On 4 June 1944, shortly before the landings were due to take place, <a href="Free%20France">Free French</a> leader <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> visited Churchill at Droxford, and was informed of the invasion plans. When discussing the future governance of liberated France at this meeting, Churchill expressed his view that if forced to side with France or the United States he would always choose the United States, a remark which instilled in de Gaulle a suspicion of British intentions and caused long-term damage to the postwar relationship between France and Britain.

After the war, with Britain's railway network in decline, services on the Meon Valley Railway were cut drastically. A section of the line north of Droxford was closed, reducing Droxford to being the terminus of a short branch line. In early 1955 the station closed to passengers, and in 1962 it closed to goods traffic. Following its closure, Droxford station and a section of its railway track was used for demonstrating an experimental <a href="railbus">railbus</a> until the mid-1970s. It then briefly served as a driving school for <a href="Heavy%20goods%20vehicle">HGV</a> drivers, before becoming a private residence and being restored to its original appearance.

The <a href="River%20Meon">River Meon</a> rises in <a href="East%20Meon">East Meon</a>, and flows through rural <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> before entering the <a href="Solent">Solent</a> at <a href="Hill%20Head">Hill Head</a>. With fertile farmland and access to the coast, the valley of the Meon has been inhabited since at least the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> era. The village of <a href="Droxford">Droxford</a> (from the Old English , "dry ford") is situated on sloping ground on the west bank of the Meon, overlooking a broad flood plain. The village has existed since at least the early 9th century; the <a href="vill">vill</a> of Drokeireford was granted by <a href="Ecgberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Ecgberht, King of Wessex</a> to <a href="Herefrith">Herefrith</a>, bishop of Winchester in 826 "for the sustenance of the monks of Winchester". At that time, the village already contained three mills. Droxford became the most important of the villages in the immediate area; by the late 19th century it housed the local post office and telegraph office, police station, workhouse and courthouse, and had its own brewery, manor house and flour mill. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201901">1901 census</a>, taken shortly before the opening of the railway, Droxford and neighbouring <a href="Soberton">Soberton</a> on the east bank of the Meon had a combined population of 1687.

Since 1851 there had been proposals to build a railway line through the Meon Valley, but all proposals were abandoned owing to high construction costs or objections from local landowners. Consequently, by the end of the 19th century the area still had no easy access to a railway line, unlike most other communities in the country.

To address this lack of service, in 1896 a group of wealthy locals proposed a railway running north–south from <a href="Basingstoke%20railway%20station">Basingstoke</a> to <a href="Portsmouth%20%26amp%3B%20Southsea%20railway%20station">Portsmouth</a>. Although it would serve a lightly populated area and consequently be of little economic benefit, the proposal's supporters argued that it would be of strategic importance, connecting military facilities in <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> and <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> with military training grounds in north Hampshire. The line was to have been operated by the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> and the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Railway%2C%20UK">South Eastern Railway</a>. 

The <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> (LSWR) and <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a>, who between them controlled rail access to the major ports of Portsmouth and <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, were aghast at the prospect of the GWR controlling a route to the south coast, and lobbied against the proposal. The LSWR promised the House of Lords Committee considering the proposal that if the scheme were rejected, the LSWR would build a line from Basingstoke to <a href="Alton%20railway%20station">Alton</a> and from Alton south along the Meon Valley to <a href="Fareham%20railway%20station">Fareham</a> between Southampton and Portsmouth. Although originally intending to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a>, when the LSWR made a formal proposal to Parliament in 1897 the proposal was for a railway built to main line specifications. The <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a> had by this time been underway for over 20 years, severely lowering agricultural incomes and allowing the LSWR to buy land along the Meon Valley cheaply.

Droxford lies on the west of the River Meon, and at the time was a large village surrounded by farmland; the station was built on the opposite side of the river, in neighbouring Soberton. Soberton was closely associated with Droxford but had its own identity, and consisted of agricultural land interspersed with small settlements. Brockbridge, the part of Soberton chosen for the station, contained only five houses; it was chosen for its location at the meeting point of five roads close to a bridge over the Meon. It was accessible to Droxford, Soberton, and the important nearby village of <a href="Hambledon%2C%20Hampshire">Hambledon</a>. Although sited in Soberton, the station was to be named for the more important Droxford.

The chosen site was <a href="glebe">glebe</a> land, historically owned by the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Diocese of Winchester</a> for the benefit of the parish of <a href="Meonstoke">Meonstoke</a>, of which Soberton was a part. After centuries as a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a> of the neighbouring parish of Meonstoke, in May 1897 Soberton became an independent parish in its own right. As such, the LSWR needed to persuade William Hammond Morley, the newly appointed <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> of Soberton, of the benefits of the railway. On 22 November 1898 Morley provisionally agreed to sell the land for the station site for £425 (about £ in 2019 terms). On 9 February 1899, following undertakings from the LSWR regarding fencing around the site and arrangements for access to remaining glebe land, the land was transferred to the LSWR. Over the following weeks compensation was paid to those people whose homes or land would be affected by the building of the station or the rerouting of roads, and the LSWR was ready to proceed with construction.

Construction of the line began in 1900, beginning at Alton and working south. The station site at Droxford was near high ground, and teams dug a deep cutting through the chalk to allow level access to the station. In mid-1900, the work team digging this cutting found human remains on the site. Construction work ceased while police investigated; it was eventually determined that the remains were Anglo-Saxon. Further bodies, along with metal jewellery and weapons, were discovered, and many of the human bodies had been covered with large pieces of <a href="flint">flint</a>. It became obvious that the site was an Anglo-Saxon burial ground. (Later excavations in 1974 identified the site as a pagan cemetery from the 5th and early 6th centuries. A total of 41 graves were identified.) Although the digging of the cutting was further delayed owing to labour shortages, work was largely completed by January 1902. By this time a hotel had opened near the site of the future station, named the Railway Hotel.

The exact date of construction is unrecorded, but it is likely that Droxford station was built in 1902. As with other stations on the line, the station building was designed by <a href="T.%20P.%20Figgis">T. P. Figgis</a>, an Irish architect who had designed many of the stations of the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> (later to become part of <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>). All the new stations for the line were of a very similar <a href="Tudor%20Revival%20architecture">Tudor Revival</a> design, built largely of red brick with <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> stonework, stained glass windows and lavatories in the shape of <a href="pagoda">pagoda</a>s. 
In anticipation of the route potentially becoming a major main line the station had two very long platforms, capable of handling 10-carriage trains, connected by a wooden <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a>. In addition, the station had a <a href="corrugated%20iron">corrugated iron</a> goods shed with its own <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a>, and a <a href="signal%20box">signal box</a> on the west (northbound) platform. The two lines converged to a single track immediately north of the station, but continued southwards as a double track. With plans for eventually doubling the track of the entire route, all cuttings, tunnels and bridges on the single-track section were built wide enough to accommodate a second track in future. The station building also incorporated a house for the stationmaster and his family, situated immediately to the left of the main entrance to the platforms. In addition to the stationmaster's accommodation in the main building, four cottages for railway staff were built to the immediate west of the station, and a coal yard was built near the station.

Although the station building was complete, work was proceeding more slowly than anticipated on the construction of the railway line, and the proposed opening date of 25 March 1903 was missed. While the route between Alton and Droxford was built on stable chalk, south of Droxford it entered the <a href="Reading%20Formation">Reading Formation</a> of stony clay, a surface on which it was difficult to build; in addition, there were very few water sources for the steam-powered construction machinery and for mixing concrete, necessitating the drilling of multiple deep wells. As well as this, construction work was regularly interrupted by bad weather. The <a href="Meon%20Valley%20Railway">Meon Valley Railway</a> was eventually completed and inspected for fitness by the Board of Trade on 6 April 1903, and the line opened to passengers on 1 June 1903. At the time of opening, the station was staffed by a <a href="stationmaster">stationmaster</a> and three <a href="signalman">signalmen</a>, as well as assorted porters and clerical staff.

The opening was relatively low-key, and no formal ceremony took place. The opening day was <a href="Whit%20Monday">Whit Monday</a>, a <a href="bank%20holiday">bank holiday</a>; local residents were each allowed to take one journey free of charge to the next station in either direction. (The free fares were only valid for a single journey; those taking advantage of the offer were obliged either to pay for a return ticket, or to walk back.) Although express services between London and Gosport were hauled by powerful <a href="LSWR%20A12%20class">LSWR A12 class</a> locomotives, the only services to stop at Droxford were local trains between Fareham and Alton, hauled by less powerful <a href="LSWR%20415%20class">LSWR 415 class</a> <a href="tank%20engine">tank engine</a>s built in the early 1880s. Initially, Droxford was served by six services a day in each direction, with two trains in each direction on Sundays.

The railway proved successful, and the availability of convenient travel to London prompted the construction of large luxury homes on the undeveloped land to the south of the station. By 1915 there were 19 new homes on the site; 12 of the 19 homes had a woman as the householder, and the development became nicknamed the "Widow's Villas". Although important as a passenger facility, the main significance of Droxford station was its impact on the local agricultural economy. For the first time milk, livestock, vegetables and in particular strawberries from the numerous local strawberry farms could be shipped cheaply and quickly to market towns. (Strawberry farming became such a pivotal part of the local economy following the construction of the Meon Valley Railway that the railway became nicknamed the "Strawberry Line". During the picking season special trains known as "strawberry specials" were laid on, carrying entire trainloads of strawberries to market.) Likewise, bulk goods such as coal and beer could for the first time be shipped cheaply to Droxford and the surrounding villages. The station also proved popular with spectators visiting the <a href="Hambledon%20Hunt">Hambledon Hunt</a>'s racecourse, approximately from the station, and with people travelling to the market in Alton, a service which proved so popular that the railway offered special ticket prices on market days.

On the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, Britain's railway network was taken into government control. While initially there was little impact on services through Droxford, the need to prioritise military needs and the transfer of railway equipment to France caused a reduction in services on the line. As the war went on, wartime shortages meant there were few goods available in the shops while labour shortages led to a rise in household incomes. Consequently, holidays increased in popularity as there was little else on which people could spend their money, causing an increase in passenger numbers on the Meon Valley railway which connected London to picturesque country villages and busy coastal resorts. The increased popularity of holidays and a national shortage of rolling stock and skilled railway staff led the government to take drastic measures. Fares were increased by 50 per cent, special holiday trains were abolished, along with almost all concessionary tickets, and a new intentionally slow timetable was introduced. The measures were not as successful in curbing demand as the government had hoped, and passenger numbers fell by only 7 per cent.

In the <a href="Post%E2%80%93World%20War%20I%20recession">lengthy recession</a> following the First World War, services on the line were further reduced. A proposed doubling of the track was abandoned, and trains in both directions used only a single line, the second track south of Droxford being utilised only as an extended siding. Trains were reduced from four to six carriages to small sets of two carriages hauled by <a href="LSWR%20M7%20class">LSWR M7 class</a> locomotives. The 1923 absorption of the LSWR into the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> (SR) led to further economies, and around 1926 the footbridge connecting the platforms of Droxford station was removed, passengers henceforward having to cross the line on foot from the northern ends of the platforms. By this time, cars and lorries were beginning to come into widespread use, providing direct competition with the railway for both goods and passenger traffic. Although the railway continued to operate six trains a day in each direction, they remained slower than they had been in 1914. With the expansion of Southampton—which already had a fast and direct service from London—as a major port, there was little need for a route from London to Gosport. In 1937 the line from London to Alton was electrified, making through trains to London no longer feasible and leaving the steam-powered Meon Valley Railway as a rural branch line.

On 3 September 1939 Britain declared war on Germany, and the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> began. Following the outbreak of war the Meon Valley railway remained in passenger and goods use during the day, and at night was used by troop trains carrying soldiers to Southampton to be shipped to France. Portsmouth and Gosport, both major military facilities within easy reach of German aircraft, were expected to come under severe bombardment, and many children from these towns were <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuated</a> along the line to the villages of the Meon Valley. As a potential strategic route the Meon Valley Line came under occasional bombing from German aircraft attempting to disrupt traffic to and from the Channel ports. In 1940 the station building was lightly damaged and two of the four railway cottages were destroyed by a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> aircraft, the only significant damage to Droxford station during the war. 

As the line was relatively lightly used, it was occasionally used for experimental purposes; in 1941 a special train visited Droxford hauled by an <a href="LSWR%20700%20class">LSWR 700 class</a> locomotive, carrying 35 <a href="Bren%20Gun%20Carrier">Bren Gun Carrier</a>s and their associated troops, as an experiment into the feasibility of carrying troops and their equipment together. Having developed vacuum problems, the train remained in the siding at Droxford for two days, before eventually progressing to the coast.

Because railway managers had proven skills in administration and of managing logistics they were in demand from the government for strategic management, and many of the managers of Britain's four railway companies were seconded to government. Additionally, although railway work was a <a href="reserved%20occupation">reserved occupation</a>, large numbers of railway staff nonetheless volunteered for military service. Staff shortages and the lack of supplies caused services on the Meon Valley line to deteriorate; the maximum speeds were reduced to for goods traffic and for passenger trains. Despite the decline in the standard of services, Droxford station remained busy. <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Fuel rationing</a> had made road transport between farms and the towns largely unviable; consequently, goods and passengers going to and from the surrounding villages largely ceased to be carried by road, and instead would be taken to Droxford station for onward shipment by train.

On the morning of 2 June 1944 orders were telephoned along the length of the Meon Valley Railway that it was to be kept free of trains to ensure a special train could use the route without interruption. The <a href="British%20Royal%20Train">royal train</a> of the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>, a <a href="LSWR%20T9%20class">T9 class</a> locomotive hauling armoured carriages, pulled into the sidings at Droxford station. Troops surrounded the station and its sidings, and the local post office was ordered to let no mail other than official business leave the village. Droxford's signalman Reg Gould, whose daughter had been born the previous month, was treated to a <a href="full%20breakfast">full breakfast</a> off the ration book.

Although officially kept secret from local residents, it soon transpired that <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had chosen the station as a secure base, to be near the coast and to the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Allied command centre</a> at <a href="Southwick%20House">Southwick House</a> during the forthcoming <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. His reason for choosing Droxford is not recorded, other than its proximity to the Channel ports; there was local speculation that the site was chosen owing to its deep cutting into which the train could be repositioned should it come under attack. Droxford also had the advantage of being overshadowed by beech trees, which obscured the view of the train.

In the company of his secretary Marion Holmes, General <a href="Hastings%20Ismay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ismay">"Pug" Ismay</a> and South African prime minister <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a>, Churchill was to remain in the carriage at Droxford for the next four days other than a few brief excursions. On those occasions in which the party needed to leave the train, it would be driven the short distance from the siding to the platform, and those on board would exit through the booking hall to staff cars waiting at the exit. For reasons unknown, Churchill refused to follow this procedure, and insisted on exiting through the goods yard.
On 3 June <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> (at that time the <a href="Foreign%20Secretary%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Foreign Secretary</a>) and <a href="Pierson%20Dixon">Pierson Dixon</a> visited Churchill on the train. Eden was unimpressed, and was later to describe the train as a place where "it was almost impossible to conduct any business" owing to their only being one bath and one telephone, each of which was constantly in use by Churchill or Ismay. A string of visits from other close confidantes of Churchill followed, including <a href="Ernest%20Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20William%20Geoffrey-Lloyd">Geoffrey William Geoffrey-Lloyd</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a>, as well as fellow Commonwealth prime ministers <a href="Peter%20Fraser">Peter Fraser</a>, <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins">Sir Godfrey Huggins</a> and <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a>. In addition to the meetings held on board, the train took Churchill, Bevin and Smuts to Southampton to watch invasion forces embark. Churchill hosted a dinner aboard the train, at which Eden and Bevin—both considered potential successors to Churchill—discussed the possibility of working together to continue <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">Britain's wartime coalition government</a> in peacetime should Churchill retire. Later that night <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, from his nearby base at Southwick House, decided to postpone the invasion from 5 to 6 June owing to predicted bad weather.

Although the Allied invasion of France was only days away, <a href="Free%20France">Free French</a> leader <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> had yet to be informed of the invasion plans. Not wishing to risk communicating with the French government in exile in Algeria about the forthcoming invasion plans, but wary of a potentially disastrous diplomatic incident should the invasion begin without French knowledge, the British cabinet had agreed to invite de Gaulle to visit England, at which time the invasion plans would be disclosed to him in person. In the morning of 4 June, de Gaulle landed at <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a>, to be met with a telegram from Churchill:
De Gaulle was apprehensive as to why he had been invited to this unusual location. He arrived at Droxford at about 1.00 pm and was met by Anthony Eden and they walked up the track towards Churchill's siding, to be greeted with open arms by Churchill on the track. They entered the train to meet Jan Smuts and Ernest Bevin, where Churchill informed de Gaulle of the imminent invasion. De Gaulle asked Churchill how a liberated France was to be administered; Churchill told de Gaulle he would need to take it up with <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and that if ever he had to make a choice between France and the United States he would always side with the United States, a statement at which de Gaulle took great offence.

Anthony Eden was horrified at how Churchill had handled such a sensitive meeting. He spoke to de Gaulle privately to make amends, but the relationship between de Gaulle and Churchill had been badly damaged. From this point onwards de Gaulle was distrustful of the relationship between Britain and the United States, ultimately leading to a breakdown of relations between post-war Britain and France and to de Gaulle's vetoing of British membership of the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>.

At 6.58 pm on 5 June, Churchill's train pulled out of Droxford and returned to London. The time of his arrival at Downing Street is not recorded, but at 10.30 pm his duty typist was summoned. At 16 minutes past midnight the following morning, Allied troops attacked <a href="Pegasus%20Bridge">Pegasus Bridge</a> and the <a href="American%20airborne%20landings%20in%20Normandy">American airborne landings in Normandy</a> began shortly after.

On 26 July 1945 the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> won a landslide victory on a manifesto that included bringing strategic industries into public control, and on 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway became the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a> of the publicly-owned <a href="British%20Rail">British Railways</a>. Although still invaluable for the transport of bulk goods, the use of railways in the area fell sharply after the war. The abolition of petrol rationing in 1950 made the car far more practical than it had been, and the location of Droxford station between the two villages meant that it was inconvenient for both. Railway stations and rolling stock had suffered from poor maintenance since the outbreak of war; trains were slow and dirty, and there was an increasing number of high-profile railway accidents. To address the decline, services on the Meon Valley Railway were drastically cut. Goods charges were increased, Sunday services were scrapped, and weekday passenger service was reduced to four trains per day in each direction with the last train leaving Alton at 4.30 pm, making day return travel to London impossible. By this time Droxford no longer had its own stationmaster, and the stationmaster of nearby <a href="Wickham%20%28Hants%29%20railway%20station">Wickham</a> was in nominal charge of the station with Reg Daniels, Droxford's senior porter, responsible for its administration.

With the railway network struggling, the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a> (BTC) proposed drastic measures. On 3 May 1954 the BTC proposed the closure of the Meon Valley Railway to passengers and the total closure of the line between Droxford and <a href="Farringdon%20Halt%20railway%20station">Farringdon Halt</a>, leaving a short stub between Alton and Farringdon and a longer route between Fareham and Droxford to carry any remaining goods traffic, by this time primarily coal for J. E. Smith's coal yard near Droxford station, and agricultural produce from the area's farms. For those passengers without access to cars, the BTC proposed improving bus services between Portsmouth and Meonstoke; they calculated that replacing four passenger trains per day with six buses would achieve annual savings of £38,000 (about £ in 2019 terms). On 17 November 1954 the BTC announced the withdrawal of passenger services, and freight services between Droxford and Farringdon Halt, effective from 7 February 1955. The BTC guaranteed that one freight train per day would run on each of the two remaining sections of the line.

As 6 February 1955, officially the last day of service, was a Sunday on which no passenger trains were due to run, the last scheduled passenger services to Droxford were those of 5 February 1955. At 7.14 pm the last scheduled passenger train to stop at Droxford pulled out, arriving in Alton at 7.43 pm. On 6 February 1955 a special train named "The Hampshireman", consisting of two locomotives hauling ten carriages, went on a circular journey leaving <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">London Waterloo station</a> at 9.45 am, passing through <a href="Pulborough%20railway%20station">Pulborough</a> and along the line from Pulborough to <a href="Petersfield%20railway%20station">Petersfield</a> via <a href="Midhurst%20railway%20station">Midhurst</a> which was also due to close the next day, north from Fareham to Alton along the Meon Valley Railway, and back to Waterloo, passing through Droxford at about 3.20 pm without stopping. With the station now a terminus with no need for signalling, the signal box was demolished later that year.

While the goods service from Droxford was kept busy during the sugar beet harvest, there was little demand for the rest of the year, and in 1956 it was reduced to three trains a week. Despite these economies, the line remained unprofitable. On 30 April 1961 the "Solent Express", an excursion train chartered by the Locomotive Club of Great Britain, paid a brief visit to Droxford, the last passenger train to visit the station. The <a href="Hampshire%20Narrow%20Gauge%20Railway%20Trust">Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Trust</a> approached Droxford council in May 1961 with a proposal to build a narrow-gauge line along part of the disused railway between Droxford and West Meon, arguing this would bring tourists to the area, but the proposal was abandoned in 1962.
On 1 June 1961 Dr <a href="Richard%20Beeching">Richard Beeching</a> became chairman of the newly formed <a href="British%20Railways%20Board">British Railways Board</a>, with a brief of returning the network to financial stability. The branch line to Droxford, profitable only during the sugar beet harvest, was an obvious candidate for closure. On 30 April 1962 goods service was ended on the branch, and Droxford station was formally closed. Reg Gould, who by this time had been signalman for over 20 years and was the "de facto" manager of the station, was transferred to nearby <a href="Swanwick%20railway%20station">Swanwick railway station</a>. The tracks remained in place, and were used for the storage of redundant goods wagons awaiting scrapping. The short stub between Alton and Farringdon Halt remained operational by goods trains until 13 August 1968, the last part of the Meon Valley Railway to close.

Following its closure, Droxford station and the track south to Wickham were leased by the <a href="Sadler%20Rail%20Coach%20Company">Sadler Rail Coach Company</a>. The company's proprietor <a href="Charles%20Sadler%20Ashby">Charles Sadler Ashby</a> had built the "<a href="Pacerailer">Pacerailer</a>", a vehicle consisting of a bus-style body on rails, and used the line to demonstrate it to potential buyers; a section was rebuilt with a 1:10 incline to demonstrate its abilities on steep gradients. At the request of the Southern Locomotive Preservation Society, Ashby allowed the use of the sidings to store engines and carriages. A serious problem with vandalism arose at the site when the tracks were intentionally blocked and points jammed in an effort to derail vehicles, and on 4 May 1970 the "Pacerailer" prototype was burned out and badly damaged. Eventually British Rail closed the Knowle junction, ending the last connection between Droxford and the railway network, and the Southern Locomotive Preservation Society abandoned the site. Hampshire County Council considered building a road along the former railway line, and in September 1972 purchased the land and leased the station building and a section of track at Droxford to Ashby. This effectively freed British Rail from maintaining utilities it had not used for many years.

Ashby died in February 1976, by which time the tracks to Droxford had been removed. The dates are not recorded, but Ashby's test track between Droxford and Wickham was probably removed in 1975, as had been the track south of Wickham in 1974. The Sadler Rail Coach Company was dissolved in December 1976, having failed to sell the Pacerailer to any railway company. A similar concept, the <a href="Pacer%20%28train%29">Pacer</a>, was successfully developed by British Rail in the 1980s. Droxford station and its associated land were taken over by a driving school; the surrounding land was tarmacked and used for the training of <a href="Heavy%20goods%20vehicle">HGV</a> drivers. In 1984 the building was sold to Colin and Elizabeth Olford, who removed the surrounding tarmac and restored the building to close to its original appearance. it remained a private residence.

History of Bradford City A.F.C.

Bradford City Association Football Club—also known informally as <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>—are an English <a href="association%20football">football</a> club founded in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> in 1903 to introduce the sport to the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, which until then had been almost entirely inclined towards <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>. Before they had even played their first game, City were elected to <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> to replace <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> in <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>, and took over the <a href="Valley%20Parade">Valley Parade</a> stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club won the Division Two title in 1908 and the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1911</a>, both under the management of <a href="Peter%20O%27Rourke">Peter O'Rourke</a>, before they were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> in <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22</a>.

City were relegated again five seasons later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a> season, they broke several club records to earn promotion back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they remained in the third and fourth tiers of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a> until <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a>. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">fire</a> in which 56 people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.

In <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1987–88</a>, the club came close to returning to the top division when they missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Following relegation back to <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a>, after <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> became chairman in January 1994 the club's fortunes were lifted. He helped to take them to their first appearance at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> and subsequently into the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond's self-proclaimed "six weeks of madness" and the collapse of television channel <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a>, the club suffered its first spell in <a href="administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. Another period under administration followed, and City dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the <a href="Football%20League%20Two">bottom tier</a> of The Football League, until promotion in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">2012–13</a> brought them back up a division. In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since 1962 to reach the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> final, and the first fourth-tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup Final.

League football was established in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a> in 1894 when the West Yorkshire League was formed. A year later the Bradford Schools Football and Athletic Association abandoned its <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League">rugby</a> roots to adopt the <a href="association%20football">association football</a> code. Several clubs across Bradford, including <a href="Bradford%20%28Park%20Avenue%29%20A.F.C.">Bradford (Park Avenue)</a>, also adopted the code during the latter years of the 19th century. By 1901, a team called Bradford City had played in the leagues within the city, playing for two seasons, but disbanded at the end of the <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">1902–03</a> season. On 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the "Bradford Observer", met with <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> representative John Brunt at <a href="Valley%20Parade">Valley Parade</a>, the home of <a href="Manningham%20F.C.">Manningham Football Club</a>, to discuss establishing a <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> club within the city. Manningham FC were a <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club formed in 1880 and became a founding member of the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20League">Northern Rugby Football Union</a> in 1895. A series of meetings was held, and on 29 May 1903, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to leave the rugby code and switch to association football. The Football League, which saw the invitation as a chance to introduce football to the <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>-dominated area of the West Riding, elected the club, which had been renamed Bradford City, to the league with a total of 30 votes to replace <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>.

Bradford City became the first league football team from the county, before they even had a team or played a game. They and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, who were elected to the league two years later, share the distinction of being the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised to raise money for the rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.

<a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28football%20manager%29">Robert Campbell</a> was appointed by a 13-man sub-committee to be the club's first secretary-manager from a shortlist of 30 applicants. Secretarial duties were carried out by committee member Whyte, with Campbell's role more on the playing side. The committee assembled a squad at the cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>917 10<a href="shilling">s</a> 0<a href="penny">d</a>. Their first game was a 2–0 defeat away at <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> on 1 September 1903, and first home game was six days later against <a href="Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.">Gainsborough Trinity</a>, played in front of a crowd of 11,000 including the <a href="Lord%20Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> and <a href="Lady%20Mayoress">Lady Mayoress</a> of Bradford. It was not until the third game against <a href="Burton%20United%20F.C.">Burton United</a> that the club recorded their first victory, on the way to a 10th-place finish in <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>. The club faced having to apply for <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation%23Early%20football%20leagues%20in%20England">re-election</a> in their second season, until five wins in the final six games lifted the club to eighth position. In November 1905, <a href="Peter%20O%27Rourke">Peter O'Rourke</a>, one of the club's <a href="centre%20half">centre-halves</a>, was appointed manager, with his last game as a player coming the following month. He guided City to finishes of 11th and fifth and then earned <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> in <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a>. The season had started with an 8–1 victory over <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> and included another six victories when City scored five goals or more, before promotion and then the title were assured with successive victories over <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> and <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> in April.
Ahead of their first campaign in Division One, Bradford City embarked upon their first continental tour; despite victories over German side <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Aachen</a> and Belgian club <a href="R.C.S.%20Vervi%C3%A9tois">Verviers</a>, the club's first league victory in the top division did not come until the fifth attempt with a 4–1 defeat of <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>. It was their only win in the first 14 games. Results improved in the second half of the season but it was not until a 1–0 win on the final game of the season against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> with a goal from <a href="Frank%20O%27Rourke%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201878%29">Frank O'Rourke</a> that City prevented an immediate relegation back to Division Two. The following season included a ten-game undefeated spell as Bradford finished seventh, but this was bettered in the <a href="1910%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">1910–11</a> season, which is Bradford City's most successful campaign. Their league finish of fifth remains the club's highest position, and an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> triumph, with a 1–0 win over <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in the <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1911 final</a> is the club's only major honour. The first- and third-round victories were secured with solitary goals from <a href="Dicky%20Bond">Dicky Bond</a>, but he missed the final four games of the run because of club suspension, the first of which was a 1–0 defeat of Burnley in the fourth round in front of 39,146 fans, a crowd which remains Valley Parade's highest attendance. The biggest win of the run came in the semi-finals with a 3–0 victory over <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>. City's supporters were taken to the final in London on 11 special trains, but the game with Newcastle at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a> ended in a goalless draw and was even described as a "decidedly dull and uneventful game". The draw meant a <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> was necessary. It took place four days later on 26 April 1911 at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, when a single goal from <a href="Jimmy%20Speirs">Jimmy Speirs</a> in the 15th minute gave Bradford a 1–0 victory. They were the first winners of a new trophy, appropriately made by Bradford jewellers <a href="Fattorini%20and%20Sons">Fattorini's</a>.

Bradford's defence of the FA Cup was ended in the fourth round by <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>, who went on to succeed Bradford as the holders. The 3–2 defeat, played at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, following two draws, brought an end to 11 consecutive <a href="clean%20sheet">clean sheet</a>s in the FA Cup—a competition record. The sequence also included a 12th clean sheet in the second replay against Barnsley which was abandoned because of crowd trouble. The cup run had included the first <a href="Bradford%20derby">Bradford derby</a> between City and cross-city rivals Bradford (Park Avenue). In the league, City finished 11th, the first of four consecutive mid-table finishes before league football was suspended because of the First World War. City's FA Cup hero Speirs, who had joined <a href="Leeds%20City%20F.C.">Leeds City</a>, was one of many footballers to lose his life during the war. Bradford City players who died included <a href="Bob%20Torrance">Bob Torrance</a>, another FA Cup winner, and <a href="Evelyn%20Lintott">Evelyn Lintott</a>, as well as several reserve team players. <a href="Frank%20Buckley%20%28footballer%29">Frank Buckley</a> and <a href="Jock%20Ewart">Jock Ewart</a> were seriously wounded, and Dicky Bond was taken prisoner-of-war. In 1921, Bond laid a commemorative wreath on the <a href="cenotaph%23The%20Cenotaph%2C%20London">Cenotaph</a> in memory of his fallen colleagues prior to a league game at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>.

With several retirements during the war, it was a new-look side that took to the field for the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a> season, when league football resumed. The 15th-place finish in the league was City's lowest since their first season in Division One, and a fourth-round FA Cup exit away at <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> was blamed on a pre-game trip to <a href="J.%20S.%20Fry%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Fry's chocolate works</a>. It was a position replicated the following season. After ten campaigns in Division One, City were relegated back to Division Two, when they lost all of their final five games of the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22</a> season. It would be 77 years until Bradford City again competed in the top division of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>.

Having lost O'Rourke as manager in 1921, after he had struggled to cope with the death of his son two years earlier, Bradford's results suffered back in Division Two. Both Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) had been relegated in 1922, and with the rise of fellow West Yorkshire side <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, attendances in Bradford dropped. City's average attendance fell from a record high of 22,585 in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21</a> to between 12,000 and 14,000 in Division Two. Five consecutive bottom half finishes culminated in relegation to <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Division Three (North)</a> in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a>, when they finished bottom of the table following a then record 8–0 defeat to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on the final day of the season. New manager <a href="Colin%20Veitch">Colin Veitch</a> missed out on guiding the club to an immediate promotion when they finished sixth, but at the end of the season the players had not been paid and the bank was unable to advance any more money because of the club's overdraft. Had it not been for donations by fans, Bradford City would not have started the following campaign. A new board was appointed, and they reinstated Peter O'Rourke as manager. Success was immediate, when the <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a> season started with a record 11–1 victory over <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>, as the side scored a club record 128 goals to earn promotion by just one point. City's successful team had also brought the fans back and the average attendance of 18,551 is the highest average recorded by the club, since 1925, when The Football League started to keep official records.

O'Rourke left for a second time in May 1930, after he resigned because he was not allowed to sign a player he wanted. City spent eight seasons back in Division Two but the nearest they came to stepping up to the top flight was in <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> when at one point they topped the division. Their sixth-place finish was the highest position since the club had been in Division One and would not be bettered until the 1980s. Relegation back to Division Three (North) came in <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37</a>. City were runners-up in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North%20Cup">Division Three North Challenge Cup</a> a year later before they won the same competition in the last year before league football was again suspended because of <a href="World%20War%20II">war</a>.

New manager <a href="Jack%20Barker">Jack Barker</a> lasted just eight months until he was replaced by former <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> player <a href="Jack%20Milburn%20%28footballer%29">Jack Milburn</a> upon the resumption of league football in 1946. Milburn led City to fifth position in his first season but only lasted another season himself. With only one team promoted from Division Three (North) each season, City remained at that level until they were placed in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> after a league re-organisation, following a 20-year high position of third the previous season. In 1960, eight years after part of the ground's Midland Road stand had been closed following examinations of the foundations ordered as a result of the 1946 <a href="Burnden%20Park%20disaster">Burnden Park disaster</a>, the entire stand was closed, leaving the ground with just three stands. After just three years in Division Three, City dropped into <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Division Four</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>, although that season they did defeat Division One side Manchester United in City's first ever <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> tie. United, like many other top flight clubs, would not enter the competition again until six years later.

Despite a club record 9–1 defeat to <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a> on 30 December 1961, City came fifth in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, thanks to <a href="David%20Layne">David Layne</a>'s 34 league goals—his total remains a club record for a season—but missed out on promotion by just one point. Layne left for <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> and City finished 23rd the following season, forcing them to apply for re-election. In 1966, the club directors moved the <a href="Pitch%20%28sports%20field%29">pitch</a> closer to the main stand, creating enough space for them to add a new safe standing area on the Midland Road side of the ground and open all four stands for the first time since 1960. Attendances continued to drop and a new record low of 1,353 was set on 12 May 1966 against <a href="Wrexham%20A.F.C.">Wrexham</a>. It prompted chairman <a href="Stafford%20Heginbotham">Stafford Heginbotham</a> to hold a crisis meeting in the city's <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hall%2C%20Bradford">St George's Hall</a> to raise new funds and safeguard the future of the club. The club's indifferent form on the field continued, with another re-election and two narrow promotion failures, before promotion was gained in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20in%20English%20football">1968–69</a>. Only the previous season, City had had three managers, when <a href="Grenville%20Hair">Grenville Hair</a>, who had replaced <a href="Willie%20Watson%20%28England%20cricketer%29">Willie Watson</a>, died just two months into his reign, after he collapsed at the end of a training session.

Striker <a href="Bobby%20Ham">Bobby Ham</a>, whose 18 goals had helped City into Division Three, was again top goalscorer the following season, but the club's stint in Division Three was short-lived. Once Ham, and fellow Bradford-born striker <a href="Bruce%20Bannister">Bruce Bannister</a>, who scored 60 goals during seven seasons with the club, both left, City were relegated back into the bottom division in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72</a>. The spell in Division Three had also been notable for the debut of <a href="Ces%20Podd">Ces Podd</a>, who went on to play a record 502 league games during 14 seasons with the club. City spent five seasons back in Division Four. In <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76</a> they had their best <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> run in more than 50 years after defeating <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, before they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> 1–0. A year later more than 40 goals from the trio of Dominican striker <a href="Joe%20Cooke%20%28footballer%29">Joe Cooke</a>, <a href="Terry%20Dolan%20%28footballer%29">Terry Dolan</a> and <a href="Don%20Hutchins">Don Hutchins</a> helped City to another promotion when they finished in fourth position. The club's <a href="board%20of%20directors">board</a> failed to strengthen the squad the following season, resulting in an instant return to Division Four. Under new manager <a href="George%20Mulhall">George Mulhall</a>, City spent three seasons in mid-table, although a late spell of form nearly earned promotion in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football">1979–80</a>.

In May 1981, City appointed former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> defender <a href="Roy%20McFarland">Roy McFarland</a> as their new manager. After starting the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1981–82</a> season with a defeat and a draw, City went top of the table during a run of nine successive league victories, equalling a 30-year club record. The run came to an end against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> in front of 13,711 fans at Valley Parade, producing then club record gate receipts of £17,938. Arctic conditions across Britain meant City played only once during December, but they went back to the top of the Division Four table in January. City finished the season second, five points behind Sheffield United, and were promoted back to Division Three. Three months into the following campaign, McFarland and his assistant <a href="Mick%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Mick Jones</a> handed in their resignation and left for <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>. Derby had to pay a large fine and compensation to City for poaching the pair. Chairman Bob Martin turned to another England centre-back and appointed <a href="Trevor%20Cherry">Trevor Cherry</a> as McFarland's replacement from West Yorkshire rivals <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C">Leeds United</a>. Cherry and assistant <a href="Terry%20Yorath">Terry Yorath</a> continued to build on McFarland's start to the period which would later be called "Bantam Progressivism" by fanzine "The City Gent". Despite not recording their first win for more than two months, the pair guided City to 12th position.
The club were again in financial difficulties, and in June 1983, Martin called in the <a href="receivership">receivers</a> and the club was put up for sale. A "Save Bradford City Fund" was launched on 24 July, and former chairman Stafford Heginbotham and former board member Jack Tordoff bought the club, forming a new company, and enabling the team to start the new league campaign. Centre forward <a href="Bobby%20Campbell%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Bobby Campbell</a> was sold to Derby County to balance the books and <a href="John%20Hawley%20%28footballer%29">John Hawley</a> brought in as his replacement. City struggled on the pitch and won just one of their first 15 games leaving them in the relegation zone. Campbell had played just 11 games during four months with Derby and so he returned to Bradford initially on a loan transfer. His return coincided with a club record ten successive league victories. Campbell finished the season with nine goals, Hawley with 22, but City finished seventh and missed out on promotion.

The good form continued the following season, and from October to mid-December 1984, City embarked on a 13-match unbeaten run, during which time Campbell became the club's all-time leading goalscorer, beating Frank O'Rourke's 70-year-old record. City went top of the division and held onto their lead, opening an 11-point cushion by February. Promotion was secured in April and the club's first championship title since 1929 after a 2–0 win over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. The success was overshadowed when <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">fire</a> ripped through Valley Parade's main stand 40 minutes into the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 against <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. A total of 56 people died and the club did not play another game at Valley Parade for nearly 20 months.

City instead played home games at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a>, <a href="Leeds%20Road">Leeds Road</a> and <a href="Odsal%20Stadium">Odsal</a> during the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season, when they came 13th, and for the first half of the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a> campaign. They returned to Valley Parade, which had undergone a £2.6m redevelopment, on Boxing Day 1986 against Derby County. After managing the side during the financial hardship and time away from their home ground, Cherry was dismissed only ten days after the return to Valley Parade. Club coach Terry Dolan was appointed as manager and he led the side away from relegation and to a finish of 10th place. By September 1987, Dolan's side topped Division Two for the first time in 54 years. They finished fourth after a final day defeat to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> and missed out on promotion after they lost to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. Leading players <a href="Stuart%20McCall">Stuart McCall</a> and <a href="John%20Hendrie%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">John Hendrie</a>, who had both stayed for another season in a bid to take City into Division One, both left, and within two seasons City again dropped into Division Three. In January 1988 Stafford Heginbotham resigned as the Club's Chairman due to ill health.

For three seasons, City finished in mid-table in Division Three and the new Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. In January 1994, <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> took over as chairman. He cleared the debts, loaned the club £2.3 million, and promised the fans he would take the club to the Premier League within five years. In his first season as chairman, the club finished in seventh place with <a href="Frank%20Stapleton">Frank Stapleton</a> as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by <a href="Lennie%20Lawrence">Lennie Lawrence</a>. Lawrence could only finish 14th in his first season, before he left for <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> in November 1995 to be replaced by his assistant <a href="Chris%20Kamara">Chris Kamara</a>.

Kamara secured a <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">play-off</a> spot with a final day victory over <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>, before City defeated <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> in the play-off semi-finals. <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">The final</a> against <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> was City's first game at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Goals from <a href="Des%20Hamilton">Des Hamilton</a> and <a href="Mark%20Stallard">Mark Stallard</a> gave them a 2–0 win, which secured promotion to Division One. Kamara used 42 players in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a> when City avoided relegation with a 3–0 victory in the final game against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. Kamara was sacked in January 1998 after an FA Cup defeat to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, when Richmond claimed the manager had taken the club as far as he could. Richmond again elevated from within and <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a>, who had been at the club since 1988, was installed as manager, originally on a caretaker basis. He was appointed full-time in May 1998 and Richmond backed his new appointment with a multi-million transfer budget. Jewell signed strikers <a href="Lee%20Mills">Lee Mills</a>, from <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> and <a href="Isaiah%20Rankin">Isaiah Rankin</a>, from <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, for £1 million and £1.3 million respectively, and signed former captain Stuart McCall from <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> on a free transfer to lead the side. Despite a poor start, the club secured promotion to the top division for the first time in 77 years with a 3–2 victory over <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the final game of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a> season.
City's success meant that <a href="Dean%20Windass">Dean Windass</a>, who had signed from <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> in March, became the club's third £1 million signing of the season. Windass had originally been signed for £950,000, but an additional fee of £50,000 was paid to Oxford because of City's promotion. Jewell broke the club's transfer record to add a fourth seven-figure signing when he paid £1.4 million to Leeds United for <a href="David%20Wetherall">David Wetherall</a>. Jewell added other senior players including <a href="Neil%20Redfearn">Neil Redfearn</a> and <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a>, prompting the media to call his team ""<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>"". When City defeated Middlesbrough 1–0 with a late goal from Saunders, his <a href="goal%20celebration">goal celebration</a> mocked the critics' comments. City failed to win another game until their eighth game of the season, and <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> pundit <a href="Rodney%20Marsh%20%28footballer%29">Rodney Marsh</a> said they would be relegated and promised to shave off his hair at a home game if they avoided such a fate. A run of nine home games without defeat and consecutive victories in April gave City hope of avoiding relegation on the final day of the season. A final day 1–0 victory over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, with a goal from Wetherall, who had played every minute of the season, and <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a>'s defeat, meant City survived with a record low of 36 points.

Less than two months after City stayed up, Jewell left to join <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, to be replaced by his assistant, <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a>. The club entered the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>, the first time they had competed in a European competition, in which they were defeated by <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">FC Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> in the semi-finals. Richmond gave Hutchings more money than Jewell to spend in the transfer market, and Bradford paid a club record £2.5 million for <a href="David%20Hopkin">David Hopkin</a> and £1.5 million for <a href="Ashley%20Ward">Ashley Ward</a>, and signed Italian striker <a href="Benito%20Carbone">Benito Carbone</a> on wages of £40,000 per week. Richmond also continued to re-develop the ground, which increased the capacity to 25,136, but later referred to his spending as his "six weeks of madness". In their second season in the Premier League, City struggled for form and Hutchings was sacked after a start to the season in which he recorded just one victory from 12 league games. Under new manager <a href="Jim%20Jefferies%20%28footballer%29">Jim Jefferies</a>, the club were unable to avoid relegation, which was confirmed with a 2–1 defeat at <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>, when they missed two penalties, before finishing the season with just 26 points.
Jefferies was sacked in December 2001 following a training ground rift with captain McCall. <a href="Nicky%20Law%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">Nicky Law</a> was appointed his successor, and the club finished the season in 15th place. During the summer, with debts of nearly £13 million—as a result of the collapse of <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a> and the fall-out from Richmond's self-proclaimed "six weeks of madness"—the club were forced into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. The players were all released, but Carbone waived much of the money owed to him, to help the club survive under new owners <a href="Julian%20Rhodes">Julian Rhodes</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Gibb">Gordon Gibb</a>. City fulfilled their fixtures during the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> season but finished 19th.

Former England captain <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a> took over as new manager during the following season, but, under his management, City won only seven games from 28 and were relegated in 23rd place. Robson left and was replaced by his assistant <a href="Colin%20Todd">Colin Todd</a>. The club went into administration for a second time, but Todd led them to 11th in each of the following two seasons. Following fan pressure and a poor run of results, Rhodes sacked Todd on 12 February 2007, with City just three points above the relegation zone. Wetherall was appointed player-manager on a temporary basis and then for the rest of the season, but City were relegated following a 3–0 defeat to <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a>. During the summer of 2007, former midfielder Stuart McCall returned as manager with City in the bottom tier for the first time in 25 years. He set himself a target of earning promotion back to <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> in his first season, but twice missed out on promotion before he left the club in February 2010 with City lying 16th in League Two.

In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League%20Cup">1962</a> to reach the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> final, and the first fourth tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup Final. They defeated three <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> sides en route to the final – <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> 4–2 on penalties in the fourth round, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–2 on penalties in the quarter-finals and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> 4–3 on aggregate over the two legs of the semi-final. They met Premier League side <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> in the <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a>, but lost 0–5. On 18 May 2013, the club returned to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> where they defeated <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> 3–0 in the <a href="League%20Two">League Two</a> <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final">Playoff Final</a> to secure a place in <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> for 2013–14. On 24 January 2015, Bradford City caused an upset by beating Premier League leaders <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 4–2 away in the FA Cup. The victory sent Bradford through to the fifth round for the first time in 18 years. There, they defeated another top-flight team, <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, to reach their first FA Cup quarter-final since 1976, in front of their biggest home crowd for 50 years.

Battle of Bardia

The Battle of Bardia was fought over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, as part of <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a>, the first military operation of the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> of the Second World War. It was the first battle of the war in which an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first to be planned by an Australian staff. <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Iven Mackay</a>'s <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a>, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29">artillery barrage</a>. The <a href="16th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">16th Infantry Brigade</a> attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. <a href="Sapper">Sapper</a>s blew gaps in the <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> with <a href="Bangalore%20torpedo">Bangalore torpedo</a>es and filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with <a href="Pickaxe">picks</a> and <a href="shovel">shovel</a>s. This allowed the infantry and 23 <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda II</a> tanks of the <a href="7th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">7th Royal Tank Regiment</a> to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.

In the second phase of the operation, the <a href="17th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">17th Infantry Brigade</a> exploited the breach made in the perimeter, and pressed south as far as a secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Infantry Brigade captured the township of Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the <a href="19th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">19th Infantry Brigade</a> advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade to make progress as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 7th Armoured Division</a> outside the fortress. In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.

The victory at Bardia enabled the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> forces to continue the advance into Libya and ultimately capture almost all of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>. In turn this would lead to <a href="Operation%20Sonnenblume">German intervention</a> in the fighting in North Africa, changing the nature of the war in that theatre.

Italy declared war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony of <a href="Libya">Libya</a> was the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Kingdom of Egypt</a>. Although a <a href="Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutral</a> country, Egypt was occupied by the British under the terms of the <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20Treaty%20of%201936">Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936</a>, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> was threatened. A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching <a href="Sidi%20Barrani">Sidi Barrani</a> on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.

Italy's position in the centre of the Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements and supplies for the area had to travel around the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. For this reason, it was more convenient to reinforce <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Sir Archibald Wavell</a>'s <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> with troops from Australia, New Zealand and <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>. Nonetheless, even when Britain was <a href="Operation%20Sealion">threatened with invasion</a> after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> after its losses in the <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">Dunkirk evacuation</a>, troops and supplies were still despatched to the Middle East Command. A convoy that departed the United Kingdom in August 1940 brought guns, stores, ammunition, and three <a href="Armoured%20regiment%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">armoured regiments</a>, including the <a href="7th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">7th Royal Tank Regiment</a>, equipped with <a href="Matilda%20II%20%28tank%29">Matilda II tanks</a>.

On 9 December 1940 the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Force">Western Desert Force</a> under the command of <a href="Major-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a> attacked the Italian position at Sidi Barrani. The position was captured, 38,000 Italian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remainder of the Italian force was driven back. The Western Desert Force pursued the Italians into Libya, and the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured Division</a> established itself to the west of <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a>, cutting off land communications between the strong Italian garrison there and <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. On 11 December, Wavell decided to withdraw the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29">4th Indian Division</a> and send it to the <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> to participate in the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">East African Campaign</a>. <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Iven Mackay</a>'s <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Australian Division</a> was brought forward from Egypt to replace it. Mackay assumed command of the area on 21 December 1940.

Unlike the <a href="Great%20Sand%20Sea">Great Sand Sea</a>, the coastal portion of the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Libyan Desert</a> is stony rather than sandy, but it is no less arid, and supports little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by <a href="wadi">wadi</a>s. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.

After the disaster at Sidi Barrani and the withdrawal from Egypt, <a href="Generale%20di%20Corpo%20d%27Armata">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Annibale%20Bergonzoli">Annibale Bergonzoli</a>'s XXIII Corps faced the British from within the strong defences of Bardia. Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: "I have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I am certain that 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." Bergonzoli replied: "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the <a href="2nd%20Blackshirt%20Division%20%2828%20October%29">2nd "28 October" Blackshirt Division</a>; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the <a href="1st%20Blackshirt%20Division%20%2823%20March%29">1st "23 March" Blackshirt Division</a> and elements of the <a href="62%20Infantry%20Division%20Marmarica">62nd "Marmarica" Infantry Division</a>; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the <a href="63%20Infantry%20Division%20Cirene">63rd "Cirene" Infantry Division</a> and the rest of the 62nd "Marmarica" Infantry Division. Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded <a href="64%20Infantry%20Division%20Catanzaro">64th "Catanzaro" Infantry Division</a>, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of "<a href="Bersaglieri">Bersaglieri</a>", part of the dismounted "Vittorio Emanuele" cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the <a href="60%20Infantry%20Division%20Sabratha">60th "Sabratha" Infantry Division</a>.

These divisions guarded an perimeter which had an almost continuous antitank ditch, extensive <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> fence, and a double row of strong points. The strong points were situated approximately apart. Each had its own antitank ditch, concealed by thin boards. They were each armed with one or two <a href="Cannone%20da%2047/32%20M35">47 mm antitank guns</a> and two to four machine guns. The weapons were fired from concrete sided pits connected by trenches to a deep underground concrete <a href="bunker">bunker</a> which offered protection from artillery fire. However, the trenches had no <a href="wikt%3Afire%20step">fire steps</a> and the weapons pits lacked overhead cover. Each post was occupied by a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> or <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>. The inner row of posts were similar, except that they lacked the antitank ditches. The posts were numbered sequentially from south to north, with the outer posts bearing <a href="Parity%20%28mathematics%29">odd numbers</a> and the inner ones even numbers. The actual numbers were known to the Australians from the markings on maps captured at Sidi Barrani and were also displayed on the posts themselves. In the southern corner was a third line of posts, known as the Switch Line. There were six defensive minefields, and a scattering of mines in front of some other posts. The major tactical defect of this defensive system was that if the enemy broke through, the posts could be picked off individually from the front or rear.
The defence was supported by a strong artillery component that included 41 <a href="Breda%20Model%2035">Breda Model 35</a> 20 mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47 mm antitank guns; 26 <a href="Solothurn%20S-18/1000">Solothurn S-18/1000</a> anti-tank rifles; 41 <a href="Cannone%20da%2065/17%20modello%2013">Cannone da 65/17 modello 13</a> 65 mm infantry support guns; 147 <a href="Cannone%20da%2075/32%20modello%2037">Cannone da 75/32 modello 37</a> 75 mm and 77 mm field guns; 76 <a href="Skoda%20100%20mm%20Model%201916">Skoda 100 mm Model 1916</a> and <a href="Canon%20de%20105%20mle%201913%20Schneider">Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider</a> 105 mm guns; and 27 120 mm and <a href="15%20cm%20schwere%20Feldhaubitze%20M%2014">Obice da 149/12 modello 14</a> 149 mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of them quite old, created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the <a href="Fuse%20%28explosives%29">fuses</a> were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The <a href="Breda%2030">Breda 30</a>, the principal <a href="light%20machine%20gun">light machine gun</a>, had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming. The <a href="Fiat-Revelli%20Modello%201914">Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914</a> was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as <a href="Fiat-Revelli%20Modello%201935">Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935</a>s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal <a href="medium%20machine%20gun">medium machine gun</a>, the <a href="Breda%20M37">Breda M37</a>, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced rate of fire. Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been.

As a "mobile reserve" there were 13 <a href="Fiat%20M13/40">M13/40</a> medium tanks and 115 <a href="L3/35">L3/35</a> tankettes. While the L3s were generally worthless, the M13/40s were effective medium tanks with four machine guns and a turret-mounted 47 mm antitank gun for its main armament that were "in many ways the equal of British armoured fighting vehicles". However, their 20 mm armour, while much thicker than that of the tankettes, could still be penetrated by the British <a href="Ordnance%20QF%202%20pounder">2 pounder</a> and the tankettes were no match for the British Matildas in either armour or firepower. None of the tanks at Bardia were fitted with a radio, making a coordinated counter-attack difficult.

Bergonzoli knew that if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya eventually must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks of food and water so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly <a href="lice">lice</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, the results of poor <a href="sanitation">sanitation</a>.

The 6th Division had been formed in September 1939 as part of an <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a>, the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> ordered that all commands in the division were to go to <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">reservists</a> rather than to regular officers, who had been publicly critical of the defence policies of <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right wing politicians</a>. These policies favoured the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period. The result was that when war came, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and its factories were only capable of producing small arms. Fortunately, these World War I-era small arms, the <a href="Lee%E2%80%93Enfield">Lee–Enfield</a> rifle and the <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a>, were solid and reliable weapons that would remain in service throughout the war; they were augmented by the more recent <a href="Bren%20light%20machine%20gun">Bren light machine gun</a>. Most other equipment was obsolescent and would have to be replaced, but new factories were required to produce the latest items, such as <a href="Ordnance%20ML%203%20inch%20Mortar">3-inch mortars</a>, <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025%20pounder">25-pounders</a> and motor vehicles, and <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> approval for their construction was slow in coming. The 6th Division's training in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, while "vigorous and realistic", was therefore hampered by shortages of equipment. These shortages were gradually remedied by deliveries from British sources. Similarly, <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron RAAF</a> had to be sent to the Middle East without aircraft or equipment, which had to be supplied by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, at the expense of its own squadrons.
Despite the rivalry between regular and reserve officers, the 6th Division staff was an effective organisation. <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> <a href="John%20Harding%2C%201st%20Baron%20Harding%20of%20Petherton">John Harding</a>, the chief of staff of <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a>, as the Western Desert Force was renamed on 1 January 1941, had been a student at <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a> along with Mackay's chief of staff, <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a>, at a time when O'Connor had been an instructor there. Harding later considered the 6th Division staff "as good as any that I came across in that war, and highly efficient." Australian doctrine emphasised the importance of initiative in its junior leaders and small units were trained in aggressive <a href="patrolling">patrolling</a>, particularly at night.

As it moved into position around Bardia in December 1940, the 6th Division was still experiencing shortages. It had only two of its three artillery regiments, and only the 2/1st Field Regiment was equipped with the new 25-pounders, which it had received only that month. The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2018%20pounder">18-pounders</a> and twelve <a href="QF%204.5%20inch%20Howitzer">4.5-inch howitzers</a>. Only A Squadron of the <a href="2/6th%20Cavalry%20Commando%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/6th Cavalry Regiment</a> was on hand, as the rest of the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at <a href="Al-Jaghbub">Al-Jaghbub</a> and <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a>. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Northumberland%20Fusiliers%20battalions%20in%20World%20War%20II%231">1st Northumberland Fusiliers</a>. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were in short supply, and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly short of <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a>, and ammunition for the <a href="Boys%20anti-tank%20rifle">Boys anti-tank rifle</a> was in short supply.

To make up for this, O'Connor augmented Brigadier <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>'s 6th Division Artillery with part of the XIII Corps artillery: the <a href="104th%20%28Essex%20Yeomanry%29%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">104th (Essex Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery</a>, equipped with sixteen 25 pounders; <a href="F%20Battery%2C%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">F Battery, Royal Horse Artillery</a>, with twelve; the 51st Field Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, with twenty four; and the 7th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery, which was equipped with two <a href="BL%2060%20pounder%20gun">60-pounders</a>, eight <a href="6%20inch%2026%20cwt%20howitzer">6-inch howitzers</a>, and eight <a href="BL%206%20inch%20Gun%20Mk%20XIX">6-inch guns</a>. There were also two antitank regiments, the <a href="3rd%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">3rd</a> and <a href="106th%20%28Lancashire%20Hussars%29%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">106th Regiments</a>, <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a>, equipped with 2-pounders and <a href="Bofors%2037%20mm">Bofors 37 mm</a> guns.

Italian gun positions were located using <a href="sound%20ranging">sound ranging</a> by the British 6th Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery. These positions disclosed themselves by firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and the barbed wire obstacles. Aerial photographs of the positions were taken by <a href="Westland%20Lysander">Westland Lysander</a> aircraft of <a href="No.%20208%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 208 Squadron RAF</a>, escorted by <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a> <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. British Intelligence estimated the strength of the Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.

At a meeting with Mackay on Christmas Eve, 1940, O'Connor visited Mackay at 6th Division headquarters and directed him to prepare an attack on Bardia. O'Connor recommended that this be built around the 23 Matilda tanks of Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Jerrram's 7th Royal Tank Regiment that remained in working order. The attack was to be made with only two brigades, leaving the third for a subsequent advance on Tobruk. Mackay did not share O'Connor's optimism about the prospect of an easy victory and proceeded on the assumption that Bardia would be resolutely held, requiring a well-planned attack similar to that required to breach the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> in 1918. The plan developed by Mackay and his chief of staff, Colonel Frank Berryman, involved an attack on the western side of the Bardia defences by Brigadier <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur "Tubby" Allen</a>'s <a href="16th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">16th Infantry Brigade</a> at the junction of the Gerfah and Ponticelli sectors. Attacking at the junction of two sectors would confuse the defence. The defences here were weaker than in the Mereiga sector, the ground was favourable for employment of the Matilda tanks, and good observation for the artillery was possible. There was also the prospect that an attack here could split the fortress in two. Brigadier <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>'s <a href="17th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">17th Infantry Brigade</a> would then exploit the breach in the fortress defences in the second phase. Most of the artillery, grouped as the "Frew Group" under British Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Frowen, would support the 16th Infantry Brigade; the 17th would be supported by the 2/2nd Field Regiment. In the event, the artillery density—96 guns for an attack on an front—was comparable to the <a href="Battle%20of%20St.%20Quentin%20Canal">Battle of St. Quentin Canal</a> in September 1918, when 360 guns supported an attack on a front. Mackay insisted that the attack required 125 rounds per gun. It had to be postponed to 3 January in order for this ammunition to be brought forward.
Much depended on the Western Desert Force's ability to move fuel, water and supplies forward. The 6th Division's Assistant Adjutant General and Quartermaster General (AA&QMG), Colonel <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a> declared: "This is a <a href="Quartermaster">Q</a> war." Captured Italian vehicles and fuel were used to haul supplies where possible. On 12 December, a Reserve Mechanical Transport company took over 80 Italian 5- and 6-ton diesel trucks that had been captured at Sidi Barrani. They were joined on 15 December by 50 7½-ton trucks that arrived from Palestine. However, the British were unfamiliar with diesel engines, and a lack of spare parts, indifferent maintenance, and hard use under desert conditions soon took their toll, leading to many breakdowns. By the end of December the Western Desert Force's vehicle fleet was only 40% of its establishment strength.

Supplies were stocked at 8 Field Supply Depot at <a href="Sallum">Sallum</a>, where a jetty was constructed by the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>. Troops of the <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 16th Infantry Brigade</a> began working the port on 18 December. They were soon joined by two <a href="Pioneer%20%28military%29">pioneer</a> companies of the <a href="Cyprus%20Regiment">Cyprus Regiment</a> and a pioneer detachment from the <a href="Palestine%20Regiment">Palestine Regiment</a>. Stores were hauled to 8 Field Supply Depot by the New Zealand 4th Mechanical Transport Company.

The port was subject to long range shelling by medium guns in Bardia, known to the Australians as "Bardia Bill", and to Italian air attacks. Only one <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">antiaircraft</a> battery could be spared for Sallum. An air raid on Christmas Eve killed or wounded 60 New Zealanders and Cypriots. Without a proper warning network, interception was very difficult. However, on 26 December eight Gloster Gladiators of No. 3 Squadron RAAF sighted and attacked ten <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.79">Savoia-Marchetti SM.79</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s escorted by 24 <a href="Fiat%20CR.42">Fiat CR.42</a> biplane fighters over the Gulf of Sallum. The Australians claimed to have shot down two CR 42s, while three Gladiators were damaged.

On 23 December the water carrier arrived at Sallum with 3,000 tons of water, while the <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a> brought another 200 tons. The water was taken to storage tanks at <a href="Fort%20Capuzzo">Fort Capuzzo</a>. Efforts were made to stock 8 Field Supply Depot with seven days' supply of fuel and stores, and 500 rounds per gun of ammunition. The effort to do so proceeded satisfactorily despite Italian air raids and blinding <a href="sand%20storms">sand storms</a>. Last-minute efforts were made to rectify the 6th Division's remaining equipment shortages. Over the last few days before the battle, some 95 additional vehicles were obtained, of which 80 were assigned to hauling ammunition. A consignment of 11,500 sleeveless leather <a href="Jerkin%20%28garment%29">jerkins</a> for protection against the cold and barbed wire were distributed, as were 350 sets of captured Italian <a href="wire%20cutter">wire cutter</a>s. The 17th Infantry Brigade finally received its 3-inch mortars but found them lacking their <a href="Sight%20%28device%29">sights</a>. An officer dashed back to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> to obtain these in time. Some 300 pairs of gloves and of marking tape arrived with only hours to go. The gloves were distributed, but the tape did not reach the 16th Infantry Brigade in time, so rifle cleaning <a href="flannelette">flannelette</a> was torn into strips and used instead.

A series of air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, in the hope of persuading the garrison to withdraw. Once it became clear that the Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, <a href="Derna%2C%20Libya">Derna</a> and <a href="Benina">Benina</a>. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bombers of <a href="No.%2070%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 70 Squadron RAF</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Bombay">Bristol Bombay</a> bombers of <a href="No.%20216%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 216 Squadron RAF</a> on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders of No. 208 Squadron RAF directed the artillery fire. Fighters from <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 33 Squadron RAF</a>, <a href="No.%2073%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 73 Squadron RAF</a> and <a href="No.%20274%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 274 Squadron RAF</a> patrolled between Bardia and Tobruk.

A naval bombardment was carried out on the morning of 3 January by the s , and and their <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> escorts. The <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> provided aircraft for <a href="Artillery%20observer">spotting</a> and fighter cover. They withdrew after firing 244 , 270 and 240 shells, handing over to HMS "Terror" and the <a href="Insect-class%20gunboat">Insect-class gunboat</a>s , and , which continued firing throughout the battle. At one point fire from "Terror" caused part of the cliff near the town to give way, taking Italian gun positions with it.

The assault troops rose early on 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of <a href="rum">rum</a>. The leading companies began moving to the start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the <a href="2/1st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/1st Infantry Battalion</a>, under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Kenneth%20Eather">Kenneth Eather</a>, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by <a href="sapper">sapper</a>s of the 2/1st Field Company carrying <a href="Bangalore%20torpedo">Bangalore torpedo</a>es— pipes packed with <a href="ammonal">ammonal</a>—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a Bangalore torpedo, resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not be heard over the din of the barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.
The infantry scrambled to their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break down the sides of the antitank ditch with <a href="Pickaxe">picks</a> and <a href="shovel">shovel</a>s. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with <a href="Mills%20bomb">hand grenades</a> and <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.

Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's <a href="2/2nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Infantry Battalion</a> found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance, because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.

At 0750 Lieutenant Colonel V. T. England's <a href="2/3rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/3rd Infantry Battalion</a>, accompanied by the <a href="Universal%20Carrier">Bren gun carriers</a> of Major Denzil MacArthur-Onslow's A Squadron, 2/6th Cavalry Regiment moved off for Bardia. Major J. N. Abbot's company advanced to the Italian posts, and attacked a group of <a href="Sangar%20%28fortification%29">sangers</a>. The Italian defenders were cleared with grenades. By 0920 all companies were on their objectives and they had linked with 2/1st Infantry Battalion. However, the Bren gun carriers encountered problems as they moved forward during the initial attack. One was hit and destroyed in the advance and another along the Wadi Ghereidia. The 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was now assailed by half a dozen Italian M13/40 tanks who freed a group of 500 Italian prisoners. The tanks continued to rumble to the south while the British crews of the Matildas "enjoying a brew, dismissed reports of them as an Antipodean exaggeration". Finally, they were engaged by an antitank platoon of three 2 pounders mounted on <a href="portee">portee</a>s. Corporal A. A. Pickett's gun destroyed four of them until his portee was hit, killing one man and wounding Pickett. The survivors got the gun back into action and knocked out a fifth tank. The portee was again hit by fire from the sixth tank, fatally wounding another man; but it too was soon knocked out by another 2 pounder. By midday, 6,000 Italian prisoners had already reached the provosts at the collection point near Post 45, escorted by increasingly fewer guards whom the rifle companies could afford to detach. The Italian perimeter had been breached and the attempt to halt the Australian assault at the outer defences had failed.

<a href="Major">Major</a> H. Wrigley's <a href="2/5th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/5th Infantry Battalion</a> of Brigadier Stanley Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade, reinforced by two companies of Lieutenant Colonel T. G. Walker's <a href="2/7th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/7th Infantry Battalion</a>, now took over the advance. The battalion's task was to clear "The Triangle", a map feature created by the intersection of three tracks north of Post 16. Wrigley's force had a long and exhausting approach, and much of its movement forward to its jump off point had been under Italian shellfire intended for the 16th Infantry Brigade. Awaiting its turn to move, the force sought shelter in Wadi Scemmas and its tributaries. Wrigley called a final coordinating conference for 1030, but at 1020 he was wounded by a bullet and his second in command, Major G. E. Sell took over. At the conference the <a href="forward%20observer">forward observer</a> from the 2/2nd Field Regiment reported that he had lost contact with the guns and could not call in artillery fire. A wounded British tank troop commander also reported that one of his tanks had been knocked out and the other three were out of fuel or ammunition. No tank support would be available until these had been replenished. Sell decided that the attack must be carried out without them.

The artillery barrage came down at 1125, and five minutes later the advance began. The sun had now risen, and <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">Captain</a> C. H. Smith's D Company came under effective fire from machine guns and field artillery to the north east. Within minutes, all but one of the company's officers and all its senior <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s had been killed or wounded. C Company's Captain W. B. Griffiths pulled his company back to the Wadi and called on a detachment of 3-inch mortars and a platoon of Vickers machine guns of the 1st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers to fire at the Italian positions. This proved effective, and Griffith's company and a platoon of A Company worked along the Wadi Scemmas, eventually collecting 3,000 prisoners.
Meanwhile, Captain D. I. A. Green's B Company of the 2/7th Infantry Battalion had captured Posts 26, 27 and 24. After Post 24 had been taken, two Matildas arrived and helped to take Post 22. As the prisoners were rounded up, one shot Green dead, then threw down his rifle and climbed out of the pit smiling broadly. He was immediately thrown back and a <a href="Bren">Bren</a> gun emptied into him. Lieutenant C. W. Macfarlane, the second-in-command, had to prevent his troops from bayoneting the other prisoners. The incident was witnessed by the Italians at Post 25 some away, who promptly surrendered. With the help of the Matildas, Macfarlane was able to quickly capture Posts 20 and 23. At this point, one tank ran out of ammunition; anti-tank fire already had blown off the track of another in the attack on Post 20. Nonetheless, Posts 18 and 21 were captured without armoured support, using the now-familiar tactics of grenades, wire cutting and assault. With darkness approaching, Macfarlane attempted to capture Post 16, but the defenders beat him off. He retired to Post 18 for the night.

Upon hearing of the losses to the 2/5th Infantry Battalion, Brigade Major G. H. Brock sent Captain J. R. Savige's A Company of the 2/7th Infantry Battalion to take "The Triangle". Savige gathered his platoons and, with fire support from machine guns, attacked the objective, away. The company captured eight field guns, many machine-guns and nearly 200 prisoners on the way, but casualties and the need to detach soldiers as prisoner escorts left him with only 45 men at the end of the day.

Lieutenant Colonel A. H. L. Godfrey's <a href="2/6th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/6th Infantry Battalion</a> was supposed to "stage a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a> against the south west corner of the perimeter", held by the 1st Battalion, Italian 158th Infantry Regiment and 3rd Battalion, Italian 157th Infantry Regiment. Instead, in what military historians consider one of the most "disastrous example of a CO seeking to make his mark", Godfrey decided instead to launch an attack, in defiance of the clear instructions he had received, and against all basic military logic and common sense. Although poorly planned and executed, Godfrey's attack managed to capture Post 7 and part of Post 9, but Post 11 resisted stubbornly.

That evening, Brigadier Savige came forward to the 2/5th Infantry Battalion's position to determine the situation, which he accurately evaluated as "extremely confused; the attack was stagnant." Savige adopted a plan of Walker's for a night attack, which began at 1230. Macfarlane advanced on Post 16. He sent a platoon around the flank to silently cut the wire on the western side, while he led another platoon against the northern side. A Bren gunner opened fire prematurely, alerting the defenders, but Macfarlane's men were able to overrun the post. The same tactic was used to capture Post R11. Macfarlane was supposed to capture Post R9, but was unable to find it in the dark. His troops attempted to capture it at dawn, but the defenders were alert and they responded with heavy fire. With the help of a <a href="2-inch%20mortar">2-inch mortar</a>, the second attempt was successful.

Meanwhile, Captain G. H. Halliday's D Company moved southwards against Post 19. He drew the defenders' attention with a demonstration by one platoon in front of the post while the rest of the company moved around the post and attacked silently from the rear. This maneuver took the defenders by surprise and D Company captured the post—and 73 prisoners—at 0230. Halliday repeated this tactic against Post 14, which was taken at 0400 with 64 prisoners. Capturing the two posts cost one Australian killed and seven wounded. A third attempt against Post 17 failed: the previous attacks had alerted the post and D Company came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. A furious battle raged until the post fell shortly before dawn. Another 103 Italians were captured at a cost of two Australians killed and nine wounded. Between casualties and men detached as prisoner escorts, D Company strength fell to 46 men, and Halliday elected to halt for the night.

Although the Australian progress had been slower than that achieved during the break-in phase, the 17th Infantry Brigade had achieved remarkable results. Another ten posts, representing of perimeter had been captured, the Switch Line had been breached, and thousands of Italian defenders had been captured. For the Italians, halting the Australian advance would be an immensely difficult task.

On the afternoon of 3 January, Berryman met with Allen, Jerram and Frowen at Allen's headquarters at Post 40 to discuss plans for the next day. It was agreed that Allen would advance on Bardia and cut the fortress in two, supported by Frowen's guns, every available tank, MacArthur-Onslow's Bren gun carriers and the <a href="2/8th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/8th Infantry Battalion</a>, which Mackay had recently allocated from reserve. Allen gave orders accordingly. During the afternoon the 6th Cavalry Regiment was pulled back to become the brigade reserve and the 2/5th Infantry Battalion relieved the 2/2nd to free it to advance the next day. That evening, Berryman came to the conclusion that unless the Italian defence collapsed soon, the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades would become incapable of further effort and Brigadier <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a>'s <a href="19th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">19th Infantry Brigade</a> would be required. Mackay was more sanguine about the situation, and reminded Berryman that his orders had been to capture Bardia with only two brigades. While they were discussing the matter, O'Connor and Harding arrived at 6th Division headquarters, and O'Connor readily agreed to the change of plan.

The 2/1st Infantry Battalion began its advance on schedule at 0900, but the lead platoon came under heavy machine gun fire from Post 54, and Italian artillery knocked out the supporting mortars. The <a href="3rd%20Regiment%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery</a> engaged the Italian guns and the platoon withdrew. Colonel Eather then organised a formal attack on Post 54 for 1330, following a bombardment of the post by artillery and mortars. The Italian guns were silenced when an Australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition dump. The Australians then captured the post. About a third of its defenders had been killed in the fighting. The remaining 66 surrendered. This prompted a general collapse of the Italian position in the north. Posts 56 and 61 surrendered without a fight and <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>s were raised over Posts 58, 60, 63 and 65, and the gun positions near Post 58. By nightfall, Eather's men had advanced as far as Post 69 and only the fourteen northernmost posts still held out in the Gerfan sector.
Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was supported by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under <a href="Lance%20Corporal">Lance Corporal</a> F. W. Squires was sent to <a href="reconnoitre">reconnoitre</a> the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.

The brigade major, Major I. R. Campbell, ordered MacArthur-Onslow, whose carriers were screening England's advance, to seize Hebs el Harram, the high ground overlooking the road to the township of Bardia. MacArthur-Onslow's carriers discovered an Italian hospital with 500 patients, including several Australians, and 3,000 unwounded Italians. Leaving a small party at the hospital under <a href="Corporal">Corporal</a> M. H. Vause, who could speak some Italian, MacArthur-Onslow pressed on with two carriers to the Hebs el Harram, where they took over 1,000 prisoners. The tanks and the remainder of A Squadron continued along the road to Bardia under intermittent artillery fire, followed by C Company of the 2/3rd Infantry Battalion. The column entered the town at 1600, its tanks firing the occasional shot.

The 2/2nd Infantry Battalion, supported by the three Matilda tanks and the guns of the 7th Medium Regiment, advanced down the Wadi Scemmas towards an Italian fort on the southern headland of Bardia. After some hours of climbing, the 2/2nd reached the headland and attacked the fort at 1645. Inside the fort were two 6 inch guns, two field guns and five other guns of the fort. Fortunately, the 6 inch guns were for coastal defence and were unable to fire inland. One of the tanks made straight for the gate of the fort. The Italians opened the gate, and the tanks moved inside, taking the garrison of 300 prisoners. D Company then followed a goat track that led to lower Bardia. Thousands of prisoners were taken, most from service units. Two carriers of the 2/5th Infantry Battalion patrolling near the coast captured 1,500 prisoners. Captain N. A. Vickery, a forward observer from the 2/1st Field Regiment, attacked an Italian battery in his Bren gun carrier and captured 1,000 prisoners.

By the end of the second day, tens of thousands of defenders had been killed or captured. The remaining garrisons in the Gerfan and Ponticelli sectors were completely isolated. The logistical and administrative units were being overrun. Recognising that the situation was hopeless, General Bergonzoli and his staff had departed on foot for Tobruk during the afternoon, in a party of about 120 men. <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Giuseppe%20Tellera">Giuseppe Tellera</a>, the commander of the Italian <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28Italy%29">Tenth Army</a>, considered the possibility of sending a force to relieve the Bardia fortress but in the end concluded that such an operation had no chance of success.

On the morning of 5 January, the 19th Infantry Brigade launched its attack on the Meriega sector, starting from the Bardia road and following a <a href="creeping%20barrage">creeping barrage</a> southward with the support of six Matilda tanks, all that remained in working order. The others had been hit by shells, immobilised by mines, or had simply broken down. The company commanders of the lead battalion, the <a href="2/11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/11th Infantry Battalion</a>, did not receive their final orders until 45 minutes before start time, at which point the start line was away. As a consequence, the battalion arrived late, and the intended two company attack had to be carried out by just one: Captain <a href="Ralph%20Honner">Ralph Honner</a>'s C Company, albeit with all six Matildas at his disposal. Honner's men had to literally chase the barrage, and had only just caught up with it before it ceased. As they advanced, they came under fire from the left, the right, and in front of them, but casualties were light. Most positions surrendered when the infantry and tanks came close, but this did not reduce the fire from posts further away. By 1115, C Company had reached the Switch Line and captured Post R5 and then R7. B Company, following on the left, cleared Wadi Meriega, capturing Lieutenant General Ruggero Tracchia and Brigadier General Alessandro de Guidi, the commanders of the 62nd and 63rd Infantry Divisions respectively. At this point, Honner stopped to consolidate his position and allow Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a>'s <a href="2/4th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/4th Infantry Battalion</a> to pass through. However, Honner took the surrender of Posts 1, 2 and 3 and his men did not stop advancing.

Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north were surrendering to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the 7th Armoured Division outside the fortress; the 2/8th Infantry Battalion had taken the area above Wadi Meriega; and the 2/7th Infantry Battalion had captured Posts 10, 12 and 15. Colonel Godfrey was astonished to discover that the 2/11th Infantry Battalion had captured Post 8. The carrier platoon of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion attacked and captured Post 13 while the 2/11th captured Post 6. The only post still holding out was now Post 11. The 2/6th Infantry Battalion renewed its attack, with the infantry attacking from the front and its carriers attacking from the rear. They were joined by Matildas from the vicinity of Post 6. At this point the Italian post commander, who had been wounded in the battle, lowered his flag and raised a white one. Some 350 Italian soldiers surrendered at Post 11. Inside, the Australians found two field guns, 6 antitank guns, 12 medium machine guns, 27 light machine guns, and two 3 inch mortars. Godfrey sought out the Italian post commander—who wore a British <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> earned in the First World War—and shook his hand. "On a battlefield where Italian troops won little honour", <a href="Gavin%20Long">Gavin Long</a> later wrote, "the last to give in belonged to a garrison whose resolute fight would have done credit to any army."

The victory at Bardia enabled the Allied forces to continue their advance into Libya and capture almost all of Cyrenaica. As the first battle of the war to be commanded by an Australian general, planned by an Australian staff and fought by Australian troops, Bardia was of great interest to the Australian public; congratulatory messages poured in and AIF recruitment surged. John Hetherington, a war correspondent, reported that,
In the United States, newspapers praised the 6th Division. Favourable articles appeared in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and the "<a href="Washington%20Times-Herald">Washington Times-Herald</a>", which ran the headline "Hardy Wild-Eyed Aussies Called World's Finest Troops". An article in the "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20News">Chicago Daily News</a>" told its readers that Australians "in their realistic attitude towards power politics, prefer to send their boys to fight far overseas rather than fighting a battle in the suburbs of Sydney". During the battle, Wavell had received a cable from General Sir <a href="John%20Dill">John Dill</a> stressing the political importance of such victories in the United States, where President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> was attempting to get the <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> Act enacted; it became law in March 1941.

Mackay wrote in a diary note on 6 January that the "Germans cannot possibly keep out of Africa now." In Germany, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, was unconcerned by the military implications of the loss of Libya but deeply troubled by the prospect of a political reverse that could lead to the fall of Mussolini. On 9 January 1941, he revealed his intention to senior members of the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>" to send German troops to North Africa, in "Unternehmen Sonnenblume"; henceforth, German troops played an important role in the fighting in North Africa.

Within the 6th Division, there were recriminations over what was seen as Berryman showing favouritism towards Robertson, a fellow regular soldier and <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> graduate, in an effort to prove that regular officers could command troops. Savige felt that some of the difficulties of the 17th Infantry Brigade were caused by Berryman, through an over-prescriptive and complicated battle plan. The 6th Division was fortunate to have drawn a "set piece" type of battle, the type that most suited its Great War-based doctrine and training. Confidence and experience was generated and leaders and staff took away important tactical lessons from the battle. The Australian official historian, Gavin Long, considered Bardia "a victory for bold reconnaissance, for audacious yet careful planning, for an artillery scheme which subdued the enemy's fire at the vital time, and a rapid and continuing infantry assault which broke a gap in the enemy's line." To attribute success to the tanks or artillery was "to present "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" without the prince."

An estimated soldiers were captured at Bardia, 1,703 (including 44 officers) were killed and 3,740 (including 138 officers) were wounded A few thousand (including General Bergonzoli and three of his division commanders) escaped to Tobruk on foot or in boats. The Allies captured defence guns, guns, guns, guns, tanks, and Australian losses totalled and 

Bardia did not become an important port as supply by sea continued to run through Sollum but became an important source of water, after the repair of the large pumping station that the Italians had installed to serve the township and Fort Capuzzo. Axis forces reoccupied the town in April 1941, during <a href="Operation%20Sonnenblume">Operation Sonnenblume</a>, Rommel's first offensive in Cyrenaica. Further fighting occurred from 31 December 1941 – 2 January 1942, before Bardia was re-taken by the <a href="South%20African%202nd%20Infantry%20Division">2nd South African Division</a>. Bardia changed hands again in June 1942, being occupied by Axis forces for a third time and was re-taken for the last time in November unopposed, following the Allied victory at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>.

Every match was contested inside the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Cages">Six Sides of Steel</a>.

Keller went on to state in his review he felt Angle versus Joe was a "really good main event". Commenting that "it felt fresh with the MMA-style, and meshed just enough pro wrestling moves in a largely believable fashion with typical (and some not-so-typical) MMA submissions throughout in dramatic fashion. It's really a stellar example of how the two styles could mesh to create a more modern, believable approach for the current era". James Caldwell also of the "Pro Wrestling Torch" published a review of the event. In his review, he also gave the main event 4 and a half stars out of 5, however, gave the Lethal Lockdown only 3 stars out of 5. Regarding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship bout, Caldwell said it was "great match", but that he felt like "there could have been more". Although, he believed this "was TNA at its best with no b.s. to get in the way, and a display of two of the best in the world". Simon Rothstein, a journalist for the United Kingdom newspaper "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>", stated in his review of Lockdown that the main event was the "best match of the night, this was perfectly booked and executed". He said that as a result it "should give TNA the impetus to quickly smash the records they set at Lockdown". On the January 1, 2009 episode of "Impact!", TNA announced their Year End Awards for 2008, with Kurt Angle versus Samoa Joe in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship named Match of the Year.

Vijayanagara literature in Kannada

Vijayanagara literature in Kannada is the body of literature composed in the <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> of <a href="South%20India">South India</a> during the ascendancy of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> which lasted from the 14th through the 16th century. The Vijayanagara empire was established in 1336 by <a href="Harihara%20I">Harihara I</a> and his brother <a href="Bukka%20Raya%20I">Bukka Raya I</a>. Although it lasted until 1664, its power declined after a major military defeat by the Shahi Sultanates in the <a href="battle%20of%20Talikota">battle of Talikota</a> in 1565. The empire is named after its capital city <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a>, whose ruins surround modern <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, now a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in Karnataka.

<a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a> during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> and <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> faiths, and to a lesser extent to that of <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders of rank, nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">metres</a>: "shatpadi" (six-line verse), "sangatya" (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), and "<a href="tripadi">tripadi</a>" (three-line verse).

The development of Veerashaiva literature was at its peak during the reign of <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">King Deva Raya II</a>, the best-known of the <a href="Sangama%20dynasty">Sangama dynasty</a> rulers. The rule of <a href="Krishnadevaraya">King Krishnadeva Raya</a> of the <a href="Tuluva%20dynasty">Tuluva dynasty</a> and his successors was a high point in Vaishnava literature. The influence of Jain literature, which had dominated Kannada language in the previous centuries, was on the wane with increasing competition from the resurgent Veerashaiva faith and Vaishnava <a href="bhakti%20movement">bhakti movement</a> (devotional movement of the <a href="haridasa">haridasa</a>s). Interaction between Kannada and <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> literatures left lasting influences that continued after the Vijayanagara era.

Before the 12th century, Jain writers had dominated Kannada literature with their "champu" (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, they had to contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their "<a href="vachana">vachana</a>" poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. <a href="Andayya">Andayya</a>'s 13th century classic "Kabbigara Kava" ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of <a href="Manmatha">Manmatha</a>, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.

This significant shift in the literary landscape was coupled with major political changes that were taking place in <a href="South%20India">southern India</a> in the early 14th century. With the decline of the regional Hindu kingdoms, the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> had risen as a bulwark against Muslim incursions from the north while creating an atmosphere conducive to development of the fine arts. In an important age of Kannada literature, competition between Vaishnava and Veerashaiva writers came to the fore. Literary disputations between the two sects were common, especially in the court of <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">King Deva Raya II</a>. Acute rivalry led to "organised processions" in honour of the classics written by poets of the respective sects. With the exception of the best-known writers from these faiths, many authors produced lesser quality writings with a sectarian and propagandist bent.

The Vaishnava writers consisted of two groups who seemed to have no interaction with each other: the <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty; and the <a href="Bhakti">Bhakti</a> (devotion) poets who played no role in courtly matters, instead taking the message of God to the people in the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres. <a href="Kumara%20Vyasa">Kumara Vyasa</a> and Timmanna Kavi were well known among the Brahmin commentators, while <a href="Purandara%20Dasa">Purandara Dasa</a> and <a href="Kanaka%20Dasa">Kanaka Dasa</a> were the most famous of the Bhakti writers. The philosophy of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a>, which originated in the Kannada–speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries. The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of "jnana" (enlightenment), "bhakti" (devotion) and "vairagya" (detachment).

This was the age of the "shatpadi" metre, although only the most skilled of poets, such as <a href="Chamarasa">Chamarasa</a>, Kumara Vyasa, Kanaka Dasa and Bhaskara used it to the best effect. Mentioned for the first time in Kannada literature by Nagavarma I in his "Chhandombudhi" (c. 990) and successfully used by the 12th century <a href="Hoysala%20literature">Hoysala</a> poet <a href="Raghavanka">Raghavanka</a>, this hexa-metre style suited for narrative poetry found immense popularity throughout the Vijayanagara period. The "shataka" metre (string of 100 verses) was put to best use by the Veerashaivas who produced most of the didactic writings in this metre, although the Jain poet <a href="Ratnakaravarni">Ratnakaravarni</a> is the most famous exponent of it. The writings of Ratnakaravarni and Kanaka Dasa in "sangatya" metre are considered masterpieces from this period.

In the royal courts, there was increased interaction between Kannada and <a href="Telugu%20literature">Telugu literature</a>s, continuing a trend which had begun in the Hoysala period. Translations of classics from Kannada to Telugu and vice versa became popular. Well-known bilingual poets of this period were Bhima Kavi, Piduparti Somanatha and Nilakanthacharya. Some Telugu poets, including <a href="Dhurjati">Dhurjati</a>, were so well versed in Kannada that they freely used many Kannada terms in their Telugu writings. It was because of this "familiarity" with Kannada language that the notable writer <a href="Srinatha">Srinatha</a> called his Telugu writings "Kannada". Translations by bilingual writers continued in the centuries to follow.

With the disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved to the courts of the emerging independent kingdoms, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> and the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi Nayaka</a>s. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and <a href="Kempe%20Gowda">Kempe Gowda</a>, the founder of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.

In the Kingdom of Mysore, the Veerashaiva literary school was challenged by the growing influence of the <a href="Srivaishnavism">Srivaishnava</a> intelligentsia in the <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> court. The Srivaishnava writers (followers of a sect of Vaishnavism) of Kannada literature were also in competition with Telugu and Sanskrit writers, their predominance continuing into the <a href="British%20Raj">English colonial rule</a> over the princely state of <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a>. Meanwhile, the radical writings of 16th-century poet Ratnakaravarni had made way for a new kind of poetry heralded by those who were not poets in the traditional courtly sense, rather <a href="itinerant%20poet">itinerant poet</a>s who travelled across the Kannada-speaking region, cutting across court and monastery, writing poems (in the "tripadi" metre) and influencing the lives of people with their humanistic values which overcame the social barriers of caste and religion. <a href="Sarvajna">Sarvajna</a> (often compared to Telugu poet <a href="Vemana">Vemana</a>), Sisunala Sherif, Mupina Sadakshari, Navalingayogi and Kadakolada Madivalappa are the best-known among them. These maverick poets heralded yet another epoch of unconventional literature in Kannada language, free of courtly conservatism and established literary tastes.

Vaishnava authors wrote treatments of the Hindu epics, the "<a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>", the "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>" and the "<a href="Bhagavata">Bhagavata</a>", as well as the <a href="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> and other subjects from the Hindu <a href="puranas">puranic</a> traditions. This was the age of Kumara Vyasa, an influential Vaishnava poet and a <a href="wikt%3Adoyen">doyen</a> of medieval Kannada epic poetry. Historians have drawn parallels between <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a> (c. 941) and Kumaraya Vyasa, while identifying fundamental differences in their style. Both are considered masters of their respective periods; while Pampa is identified as a stylist of the classical age, Kumara Vyasa is considered a generalist of the medieval age. Unlike Pampa, a product of the "marga" (Sanskritic-mainstream) period of Kannada literature, Kumara Vyasa successfully wielded the flexibility of the "desi" (native) "shatpadi" metre, which used a range of language that included metaphors, similes, humour and even vulgarity.

Kumara Vyasa wrote "Gadugina Bharata" in 1430 in the <a href="Vyasa">Vyasa</a> tradition. The title of the work is a reference to "Gadagu" (modern <a href="Gadag">Gadag</a>), where the author lived. The writing is based on the first ten chapters of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and is also alternatively titled "Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari" or "Kumaravyasa Bharata". It is a dedication to the deity of Gadag and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Hindu god Krishna. Unlike Pampa, who adhered to a strictly Jain interpretation of the epic in his "<a href="Vikramarjuna%20Vijaya">Vikramarjuna Vijaya</a>" (941), eulogising <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> as the hero, making <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a> solely Arjuna's wife and casting the <a href="Kaurava">Kaurava</a> prince <a href="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a> and his loyal companion <a href="Karna">Karna</a> as lofty individuals, Kumara Vyasa portrays all characters with the exception of Krishna as deeply human with foibles. His depiction of the secondary characters, such as the cunning Keechaka and the coward Uttara Kumara, is also noteworthy. An interesting aspect of the work is the sense of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marks the transition in Kannada literature from old to modern. Particularly known for his use of sophisticated <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>s, Kumara Vyasa earned the title "Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti" ("Emperor of the land of Metaphors"). The remaining chapters of the epic were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) of the court of <a href="Krishnadevaraya">King Krishnadevaraya</a>. The poet named his work "Krishnaraya Bharata" after his patron king. "Airavata" (1430) by Kumara Vyasa recounts an episode from the Mahabharata and is a story of the elephant ridden by god <a href="Indra">Indra</a>.

Inspired by Kumara Vyasa, the first complete <a href="Vedic%20Brahmanism">brahminical</a> adaptation of the epic Ramayana was written by Kumara Valmiki (a pseudonym of Narahari, 1500) and is called "Torave Ramayana" after the village Torave, where it was composed. As with the Mahabharata, this adaptation veers away from the Jain version by Nagachandra (1105). Nagachandra had used the "champu" metre popular in Sanskrit works and sought to portray <a href="Ravana">Ravana</a> as a tragic hero. In a departure from the original version (by <a href="Valmiki">Valmiki</a>), the Jain epic ends with Rama's asceticism and "<a href="nirvana">nirvana</a>". Kumara Valmiki's account, written in the Valmiki tradition, is in the "shatpadi" metre and is steeped in the author's devotion for the god <a href="Rama">Rama</a>, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. According to the author, the epic he wrote was actually a recounting of Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. In this version of the epic, King Ravana, the villain, is one of the suitors at <a href="Sita">Sita</a>'s <a href="Swayamvara">Swayamvara</a> ("lit" a ceremony of "choice of a husband"). His failure in winning the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, <a href="Hanuman">Hanuman</a>, for all his services, is heaped with <a href="encomium">encomium</a> and is exalted to the status of "the next creator". At the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that Rama is none other than the god Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation. The chapter narrating the war ("Yuddhakanda") is given prominence over all other chapters. The writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the <a href="Yakshagana">Yakshagana</a>, which draws from episodes of "Torave Ramayana" for enactment. The influence of the Puranic tradition and that of <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> are visible in this lively yet religious narration that uses every opportunity to glorify its hero, Rama. However, the author has been criticised for dwelling in abstractions and for not reaching the graceful poetic level of his predecessor Kumara Vyasa.

The early Bhagavata writings in Sanskrit by well-known "acharyas" (gurus) were solely meant to have a proselytising effect on the masses, encouraging them to a theistic way of life and belief in the god Krishna. Chatu Vitthalanatha, who flourished as a court poet of King Krishnadeva Raya and his successor <a href="Achyuta%20Deva%20Raya">King Achyuta Raya</a>, was the first to translate the "Bhagavata" into Kannada in a voluminous writing comprising 12,247 stanzas divided into 280 sections. The work covered the entire original version in "shatpadi" metre. Two other names appear in the colophons, Sadananda Yati and Nityatma Sukayogi, prompting some scholars to attribute the work to the group while others consider them alternate names of the same writer. The work covers all ten <a href="avatar">avatar</a>s of the god Vishnu, though it is essentially centred on the depiction of Krishna as the supreme Lord. The purana covers stories of Vishnu's famous devotees such as <a href="Prahlad">Prahlad</a> and <a href="Dhruva">Dhruva</a> in detail, as well as stories of demons Vritasura, <a href="Hiranyakashipu">Hiranyakashipu</a> and others who sought to attain salvation by dying at the hands of Vishnu. Most noteworthy is the epic's influence on the compositions of the Haridasas. Though the writing is not considered as important as the other two epics of the period, its significance to religiously minded people is well accepted. Chatu Vitthalanatha wrote a fuller version of portions of the epic Mahabharata as well. Other notable writers of the 16th century were Tirumala Bhatta ("Siva Gite") and Ramendra ("Saundarya Katharatna", using "tripadi" metre).

The Veerashaiva writers were devotees of the Hindu god Shiva, his 25 forms, and the expositions of <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a>. An important development in their literature during this period was the recasting the saints of the 12th century Veerashaiva movement (<a href="Basavanna">Basavanna</a>, <a href="Allama%20Prabhu">Allama Prabhu</a> and others) as the protagonists of their writings.

Bhima Kavi paved the way for the "shatpadi" metre tradition in his work "Basavapurana" (c.1369), a form first experimented with by the 12th century <a href="Hoysala">Hoysala</a> poet Raghavanka. Bhima Kavi's work, a biography of Basavanna, is an important Veerashaiva "purana". It was inspired by earlier biographies of Basavanna by the Hoysala poet <a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a> (the author of the first biographical narrative poem of the protagonist's life called "Basavaraja Ragale") and the Telugu writings of <a href="Palkuriki%20Somanatha">Palkuriki Somanatha</a> of the 13th century. Bhima Kavi humbly acknowledges and eulogises his predecessors in a writing full of well-known personalities.

The author starts with Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous "sharanas" (devotees of Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is depicted as a saintly person, a great devotee of Shiva, an incarnation of <a href="Nandi%20%28bull%29">Nandi</a>, a man of miracles and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva faith on earth. The work is arranged into eight "aswasas" (divisions) containing sixty-one "sandhis" (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of devotees of Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the "Bhimakaviswara Ragale" and the "Bhringidandaka".

Chamarasa, Lakkanna Dandesa and Jakkanarya flourished under the patronage of King Deva Raya II. Chamarasa, champion of the Veerashaiva faith, was a rival of Kumara Vyasa in the court of King Deva Raya II. His "magnum opus", the "Prabhulinga Lile" (1430) was a eulogy of 12th-century saint Allama Prabhu; it was translated into Telugu and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil language</a> at the behest of his patron king, and later into the Sanskrit and <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi language</a>s. In the story, the saint is considered an incarnation of Hindu god <a href="Ganapathi">Ganapathi</a> while <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> took the form of a princess of Banavasi. In stark contrast to Kumara Vyasa's war-torn epic, Chamarasa delivered a writing full of spirituality. A remark made by the poet in the writing, that his story is "not about ordinary mortals", implied that the Vaishnava epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were about mortals; this was evidence of rivalry between the two faiths.

Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime minister and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled "Sivatattva Chintamani". This work is an account of the life of Basavanna, the progenitor of the faith, and hundreds of his followers, making it valuable material for students of the Lingayat movement. Numerous references are made in this work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote "Nurondusthala" (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote "vachana" poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called "shatsthala"). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of <a href="Saluva%20Narasimha%20Deva%20Raya">King Saluva Narasimha I</a>, Adrisappa ("Praudaraya Charitra"), Bommarasa ("Soundara Purana"), Kallarasa ("Janavasya"), Chaturmukha Bommarasa ("Revanasiddhesvara Purana"), Suranga Kavi ("Trisashti Puratanara Charitre"), and Nilakanthacharya ("Aradhya Charitra"), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.

In 1500, inspired by Palkuriki Somanatha (a bilingual poet in Kannada and Telugu), Singiraja synthesised an account on the life of Basavanna titled "Maha Basavaraja Charitra" (or "Singiraja Purana"), using the protagonist's "vachana" poems and giving details of his 88 famous deeds, as well as information about his opponents in the court of <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Southern Kalachuri</a> <a href="Bijjala%20II">King Bijjala II</a>. An eminent poet of this time was Guru Basava, known for his authorship of seven famous poems ("Sapta Kavya"), all but one being written in the "shatpadi" metre. He expounded on religious teachings in the form of formal discussions between the <a href="guru">guru</a> and disciple. His "kavyas" (classical epic poems) deal with spiritualism and extrasensory perception.

Mallanarya of <a href="Gubbi">Gubbi</a>, a poet bilingual in Kannada and Sanskrit, enjoyed the patronage of King Krishnadeva Raya. His important writings in Kannada in the "shatpadi" metre are the "Bhava Chintaratna" (also called "Satyendra Chole Kathe", 1513) and the "Virasaivamrita Purana" (1530). The former was based on a 7th-century Tamil work and about a <a href="Chola">Chola</a> King in the context of the Shaiva faith; the latter is a writing of encyclopedic proportions that goes beyond philosophical content, describing the various forms (or sports, called "lila") of god Shiva and the lives of famous Shaiva saints.

In 1584, Virupaksha Pandita, the head priest at the <a href="Virupaksha%20Temple%2C%20Hampi">Virupaksha Temple</a> in Vijayanagara, wrote an account on the life and deeds of the 12th-century saint and "vachana" poet <a href="Channabasavanna">Chennabasava</a>. The writing, titled "Chenna Basava Purana", regards the protagonist as an incarnation of god Shiva and describes the glory of Shiva and his famous devotees. The book gives valuable information, including dates, about early Veerashaiva saints and "vachanakaras" ("vachana" poets). In addition to religious content, the writing provides useful insights about the former capital Vijayanagara, its royal palace, its market places and merchants, its military encampments, specialisations and divisions and the guilds of workers who served the military in various capacities. Other authors from the 16th century were Chermanka ("Chermanka Kavya"), Virabhadraraja ("Virabhadra Vijaya"), Chennabasavanka ("Mahadevi Akkanna Purana"), Nanjunda of <a href="Ikkeri">Ikkeri</a> ("Bhairavaesvara Kavya") and Sadasiva Yogi ("Ramanatha Vilasa").

The cultural supremacy of the <a href="Jainism">Jains</a> steadily diminished from the 12th century; the decline began in the 10th century after the conquest of the predominantly Jain <a href="Rashtrakuta%20dynasty">Rashtrakutas</a> by the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a>, and the defeat of the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20dynasty">Ganga</a> kingdom by the <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Cholas</a> of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a>. While Veerashaivism flourished in northern Karnataka from the time of Basavanna, <a href="Sri%20Vaishnavism">Sri Vaishnavism</a> (a branch of Vaishnavism) thrived in the South due to the influence of <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a>. The Hoysala king <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> and his descendants took to Vaishnavism. Though tolerant of all faiths, the founders of the Vijayanagara Empire and the succeeding kings of the Sangama dynasty were Shaivas by faith (devotees of Shiva) while the later Tuluva dynasty kings were Sri Vaishnavas (followers of Sri Vaishnavism). The Jain population appears to have begun its decline from this period; however, available records include a decree by <a href="Bukka%20Raya%20I">King Bukka Raya I</a> giving Jains freedom of worship, following their complaint of persecution. Although the influence of Jainism and its literature was on the wane, the coastal areas of modern Karnataka, where important Jain monuments and monoliths were constructed, remained a stronghold. As in earlier centuries, Jain authors wrote about <a href="tirthankar">tirthankar</a>s, princes and other personages important to the Jain religion. Most famous among Jain poets from the coastal Karnataka region were Ratnakaravarni, Abhinava Vadi Vidyananda, Salva and Nemanna.

Ratnakaravarni of <a href="Mudabidri">Mudabidri</a> (1557), court poet at <a href="Karkala">Karkala</a> under the patronage of Bhairasa Wodeyar, is famous for successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of eros with discretion in a religious epic, his "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>" the "Bharatadesa Vaibhava". One of the most popular poets of Kannada literature, Ratnakaravarni's writings were popular across religions and sects. He appears to have had tense relationships with both court and monastery, however, owing to writings on erotics and the science of pleasure, rather than purely spiritual poetry. A radical and sensitive poet, he once claimed that spiritual meditation "was boring". Tradition has it that Ratnakaravarni converted to Veerashaivism when his "Bharatadesa Vaibhava" (also called "Bharatesvara Charite") was initially scorned, later to return to the Jain fold and pen other important writings. The "Bharatadesa Vaibhava" is written in eighty <a href="canto">canto</a>s and includes 10,000 verses. His other important writings include the 2,000 spiritual songs called "Annagalapada" ("Songs of the Brothers") and the three "shatakas": the "Ratnakara sataka", the "Aparajitesvara shataka" (a discourse on Jain morals, renunciation and philosophy) and the "Trilokya shataka", an account of the universe as seen by Jains, consisting of heaven, hell and the intermediate worlds.
"Bharatadesa Vaibhava" is a version of the earlier "Poorvapurana" by <a href="Jinasena">Jinasena</a>charya and reflects a different perspective than the "<a href="Adipurana">Adipurana</a>" written by Adikavi Pampa c. 941. Centred on the glorification of the enlightened Bharata, the son of the first Jain "tirthankar" <a href="Rishabha">Adinatha</a>, Ratnakaravarni cleverly focuses on those aspects that the original by Pampa ignored. Ratnakaravarni goes into minute detail about prince Bharata who, according to the author, serves as the ideal balance between detachment ("yoga") and attachment ("bhoga"). Though married to "96,000 women", Bharata is depicted as one who at once could separate himself from worldly pleasures. Unlike Pampa, who focused on the conflict between the brothers <a href="Bahubali">Bahubali</a> and Bharata, ending with Bahubali's asceticism and Bharata's humiliation, Ratnakaravarni's eulogy of Bharata leaves room only for Bahubali's evolution towards sainthood. Eventually, Bharata attains "<a href="moksha">moksha</a>" (liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth) by burning himself in ascetic fire. The author showers encomium on Bharata in his various roles as monarch, husband, son, friend and devotee, a rare description of a "perfect human being" among Jain writings. Since details of the early life of Bharata as a young ruler did not exist in previous writings or in tradition, much of Ratnakaravarni's vivid description of that period was a product of his imagination. This work finds its pride of place in Kannada's epic poetry as the longest poem in the folk "sangatya" metre.

Salva (1550), who was the court poet of a <a href="Konkan">Konkan</a> prince named Salvamalla, wrote a propagandist work called the "Salva Bharata". This was a Jain version of the epic Mahabharata in sixteen "parvas" (divisions), intended to compete with the Vaishnava version of the epic written by Kumar Vyasa in the mid-15th century. Abhinava Vadi Vidyananda of Gerosoppa (1553) wrote "Kavya Sara", a 1,143 verse anthology of extracts of subjects written about by earlier poets between 900 and 1430. The text closely resembles an anthology written by Hoysala poet Mallikarjuna (1245), with some additions to account for writings in the post Mallikarjuna era. A staunch Jain and a disputant, Vidyananda argued for the cause of his faith in the Vijayanagara court and other provincial courts. Nemanna (1559) wrote "Jnana Bhaskara Charite" on the importance of inner contemplation rather than rituals as the correct path towards emancipation.

In Vijayanagara, Madhura was the court poet of <a href="Harihara%20II">King Harihara II</a> and <a href="Deva%20Raya%20I">King Deva Raya I</a> under the patronage of their respective prime ministers. He is famous for his account of the 15th tirthankar titled "Dharmanatha Purana" (1385), written in a style similar to that of Jain poets of earlier centuries. Madhura is also credited with a poem about <a href="Gomateshwara">Gomateshwara</a> of <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a>. Ayata Varma, who is tentatively dated to 1400, translated from Sanskrit a "champu" (mixed prose-verse) titled "Ratna Karandaka" describing Jain ideologies. Manjarasa, a feudatory king of Kallahalli and a Vijayanagara general of rank, wrote two books. "Nemijinesa Sangata", completed in 1508, was an account of the life of the 22nd Jain tirthankar; "Samyukta Koumudi", written in 1509, comprised 18 short stories on religious values and morals.

An important "shatpadi" writing from this period is the "Jivandhara Charite" (1424) by Bhaskara, a story of Prince Jivanadhara, who regained the throne usurped by his father. Other well-known Jain writers were Kalyanakirti ("Jnanachandrabhyudaya", 1439), Santikirtimuni ("Santinathacharite", 1440), Vijayanna ("Dvadasanuprekshe", 1448), Bommarasa of Terakanambi ("Sanatkumara Charite", 1485), Kotesvara (1500), Mangarasa III ("Jayanripa Kavya"), Santarasa ("Yogaratnakara"), Santikirti ("Santinatha Purana", 1519), Doddayya ("Chandraprabha Purana", 1550), Doddananka ("Chandraprabha Purana", 1578) and Bahubali Pandita of Sringeri ("Dharmanathapuranam", 1352).

Although most of the writings that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing in a variety of commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.

Writings in various literary genres such as romance, fiction, erotica, folk songs and musical compositions were popular. A wealth of literature dealing in subjects such as astronomy, meteorology, veterinary science and medicine, astrology, grammar, philosophy, poetry, prosody, biography, history and lexicon, as well as dictionaries and encyclopedias, were written in this era.

In 1360, Manjaraja I wrote a book on medicine called "Khagendra Mani Darpana", basing it on the 5th century writings of <a href="Pujyapada">Pujyapada</a>. Padmananka (1385) wrote a biography of his ancestor Kereya Padmarasa, a Hoysala minister and poet, in a work titled "Padmaraja Purana". The writing provides details about the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> and notable personalities such as the poets Harihara and Raghavanka. Chandrashekara (or Chrakavi), a court poet of Deva Raya II, wrote an account on the Virupaksha temple, its precincts and settlements at Pampapura (modern <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>) in the "Pampasthana Varnanam" in 1430. Mangaraja II authored a lexicon called "Mangaraja Nighantu" in 1398, while Abhinava Chandra gave an account on veterinary science in his book called "Asva Vaidya" in the 14th century. Kavi Malla wrote on erotics in the "Manmathavijaya" in the 14th century. In the 15th century, Madhava translated an earlier Sanskrit poem by Dandi and called it "Madhavalankara", and Isvara Kavi (also called Bana Kavi) wrote a prosody called "Kavijihva Bandhana".

Deparaja, a member of the royal family, authored "Amaruka" and a collection of romantic stories called the "Sobagina Sone" (1410), written in the form of a narration by the author to his wife. However, according to Kotraiah, "Sobagina Sone" was actually written by King Deva Raya II. The writing contains interesting details on the king's hunting expeditions and on the professional hunters who accompanied him. In 1525, Nanjunda Kavi, a feudatory prince wrote on local history, published a eulogy of prince Ramanatha (also called <a href="Kumara%20Rama">Kumara Rama</a>) titled "Ramanatha Charite" (or "Kumara Rama Sangatya") in the "sangatya" metre. The poem is about the prince of <a href="Kampili">Kampili</a> and his heroics at the dawn of the Muslim invasion into southern India. This work combines folk and epic literature. The protagonist rejects the advances of his stepmother, only to be condemned to death. He is rescued by a minister, but eventually achieves martyrdom fighting Muslim invaders at the capital.

In 1567, Jain ascetic Srutakirti of Mysore translated from Sanskrit a biographic poem of a Hoysala lady Vijayakumari in "Vijayakumari Charite". The writing goes into detail about a city (believed to be Vijayanagara, the royal capital), discussing its shops, guilds and businesses. The text describes the rigid <a href="caste%20system">caste</a>-based human settlements and notes that people involved in mundane duties such as washing, barbering, pot-making and carpentry lived outside the fort walls in streets constructed specifically for them. Salva (1550) authored two poems called "Rasa Ratnakar" and "Sharada Vilas". The former is about "rasa" (poetical sentiment or flavour) and the latter, only portions of which have been recovered, is about the "dhvani" (suggested meaning) in poems. Thimma's "Navarasalankara" of the 16th century also discusses poetical flavour. In the 16th century, lexicons were written by Lingamantri ("Kabbigarakaipidi") and Devottama ("Nanaratha Ratnakara"). At the turn of the 17th century, <a href="Bhattakalanka%20Deva">Bhattakalanka Deva</a> wrote comprehensively on old Kannada grammar. His "Karnataka Sabdanusasanam" is modelled on the lines of Sanskrit grammar and is considered an exhaustive work.

Unlike the Veerashaiva movement which preached devotion to the god Shiva with an insistence on a <a href="classless%20society">classless society</a> and had its inspiration from the lower classes of society, the haridasa movement started from the higher echelons and preached devotion to the god Vishnu in a more flexible caste-based society, eventually becoming popular among the common people. The beginnings of the haridasa tradition can be traced to the Vaishnava school of <a href="Dvaita">Dvaita</a> philosophy pioneered by Madhvacharya. Its influence on Kannada literature in the early 14th century is seen in the earliest known compositions written by Naraharitirtha, a prominent disciple of Madhvacharya.

The Vaishnava <a href="Bhakti%20movement">Bhakti</a> (devotional) movement involving well-known <a href="haridasa">haridasa</a>s (devotee saints) of the 14th through 16th centuries made an indelible imprint on Kannada literature, with the development of a body of literature called "Haridasa Sahitya" ("Haridasa literature"). This philosophy presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions, similar to the effects of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century. The haridasas conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through esoteric Sanskrit writings (written by "Vyasa kuta" or Vyasa school) and simple Kannada language compositions, appealing to the common man, in the form of devotional songs (written by the "Dasa Kuta" or Dasa school). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as <a href="Naraharitirtha">Naraharitirtha</a>, <a href="Jayatirtha">Jayatirtha</a>, <a href="Vyasatirtha">Vyasatirtha</a>, <a href="Sripadaraya">Sripadaraya</a>, <a href="Vadirajatirtha">Vadirajatirtha</a>, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa and others.

Compositions in the haridasa literature are sub-divided into four types: "kirthane", "suladi", "ugabhoga" and "mundige". "Kirthanes" are devotional musical compositions with refrains based on <a href="raga">raga</a> and "<a href="Tala%20%28music%29">tala</a>" and celebrate the glory of god. The "suladi" are tala based, the "ugabhoga" are <a href="melody">melody</a> based while the "mundige" are in the form of <a href="riddle">riddle</a>s. Compositions were also modelled on "jogula" (lullaby songs) and "sobane" (marriage songs). A common feature of haridasa compositions are influences from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.

Haridasa poetry, which faded for a century after the death of Naraharitirtha, resurfaced with Sripadaraya, who was for some time the head of the Madhva <a href="matha">matha</a> (monastery of Madhvacharya) at Mulubagilu (in modern <a href="Kolar%20district">Kolar district</a>). About a hundred of his "kirthanes" have survived, written under the pseudonym "Sriranga Vithala". Sripadaraya is considered a pioneer of this genre of devotional songs. Sripadaraya's disciple, Vyasatirtha (or Vyasaraya), is most famous among the latter day Madhva saints. It was he who created the "Vyasa kuta" and "Dasa kuta" schools within the Madhva order. He commanded respect from King Krishnadeva Raya, who honoured him with the title "kuladevata" (family god). A poet of merit in Kannada and the author of seminal works in Sanskrit, Vyasatirtha was the guru responsible for shaping the careers of two of Kannada's greatest saint-poets, Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa. Another prominent name in the age of "Dasa" (devotee) literature is Vadirajatirtha, a contemporary of Purandara Dasa and the author of many works in Kannada and Sanskrit.

Purandara Dasa (1484–1564), a wandering bard who visited Vijayanagara during the reign of <a href="Achyuta%20Deva%20Raya">King Achyuta Raya</a>, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages, although only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various <a href="raga">raga</a>s, and often ending with a salutation to the Hindu deity <a href="Vittala">Vittala</a>, his compositions presented the essence of the <a href="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> and the <a href="Puranas">Puranas</a> in simple yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a>, and codified the <a href="musical%20composition">musical composition</a> forms "<a href="Swarajatis">svaravalis</a>", "alankaras" and "<a href="geethams">geethams</a>". Owing to his contributions in music, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific "Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha" ("Father of Carnatic Music").

Kanaka Dasa (whose birth name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern <a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri district</a>) was an <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> and spiritual seeker, who according to historical accounts came from a family of <a href="Kuruba">Kuruba</a> (shepherds) or "beda" (hunters). Under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king, he authored such important writings as "<a href="Mohanatarangini">Mohanatarangini</a>" ("River of Delight", 1550), written in dedication to King Krishnadevaraya, which narrates the story of Krishna in "sangatya" metre. His other famous writings are "Narasimhastava", a work dealing with glory of God <a href="Narasimha">Narasimha</a>, "Nalacharita", the story of <a href="Nala">Nala</a>, which is noted for its narration, and "Hari Bhaktisara", a spontaneous writing on devotion in "shatpadi" metre. The latter writing, which is on "niti" (morals), "bhakti" (devotion) and "vairagya" (renunciation), continues to be a popular standard book of learning for children. A unique allegorical poem titled "Ramadhanya Charitre" ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which exalts <a href="Finger%20millet">ragi</a> over <a href="rice">rice</a> was authored by Kanaka Dasa. In this poem, a quarrel arises between ragi, the food grain of the poor, and rice, that of the rich, as to which is superior. Rama decides that ragi is superior because it does not rot when preserved. This is one of the earliest poetic expressions of class struggle in the Kannada language. In addition to these classics, about 240 songs written by Kanaka Dasa are available.

For a brief period following the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the devotional movement seemed to lose momentum, only to become active again in the 17th century, producing an estimated 300 poets in this genre; famous among them are <a href="Vijaya%20Dasa">Vijaya Dasa</a> (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), <a href="Jagannatha%20Dasa">Jagannatha Dasa</a> (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over time, their devotional songs inspired a form of religious and <a href="didactic">didactic</a> performing art of the Vaishnava people called the "<a href="Harikatha">Harikatha</a>" ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among the followers of the Veerashaiva faith, who popularised the "Shivakatha" ("Stories of Shiva").

"Vachana" poetry, developed in reaction to the rigid caste-based Hindu society, attained its peak in popularity among the under-privileged during the 12th century. The Veerashaivas, who wrote this poetry, had risen to influential positions by the Vijayanagara period. Following the Muslim invasions in the early 14th century, Brahmin scholars methodically consolidated writings of Hindu lore. This inspired several Veerashaiva anthologists of the 15th and 16th centuries to collect Shaiva writings and "vachana" poems, originally written on palm leaf manuscripts. Because of the cryptic nature of the poems, the anthologists added commentaries to them, thereby providing their hidden meaning and esoteric significance. An interesting aspect of this anthological work was the translation of the Shaiva canon into Sanskrit, bringing it into the sphere of the Sanskritic cultural order.

Well known among these anthologies are "Ganabhasita Ratnamale" by Kallumathada Prabhudeva (1430), "Visesanubhava Satsthala" by Channaviracharya (16th century) and "Bedagina Vachanagalu" by Siddha Basavaraja (1600). The unique "<a href="Shunyasampadane">Shunyasampadane</a>" (the 'mystical zero') was compiled in four versions. The first among them was anthologised by Shivaganaprasadi Mahadevaiah (1400), who set the pattern for the other three to follow. The poems in this anthology are essentially in the form of dialogues between patron saint Allama Prabhu and famous "Sharanas" (devotees), and was meant to rekindle the revolutionary spirit of the 12th century. Halage Arya (1500–1530), Gummalapura Siddhalinga Yati (1560) and Gulur Siddaveeranodaya (1570) produced the later versions.

Though the writing of "vachana" poems went into decline after the passing of the Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day "vachanakaras" such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of <a href="Virupaksha%20Raya%20II">King Virupaksha Raya II</a>, started a revival. He wrote "Shatsthala Jnanamrita" (1540), a collection of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara the central theme in his writing "Siddhesvara Purana". Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known "vachana" poets who tried to recreate the glory days of the early poets, though the socio-political expediency did not exist.

Mystic literature had a resurgence towards the beginning of the 15th century, in an attempt to synthesise the Veerashaiva and <a href="advaitha">advaitha</a> (monistic) philosophies; this trend continued into the 19th century. Prominent among these mystics was <a href="Nijaguna%20Shivayogi">Nijaguna Shivayogi</a>, by tradition a petty chieftain near the <a href="Kollegal">Kollegal</a> region (modern <a href="Mysore%20district">Mysore district</a>) turned Shaiva saint, who composed devotional songs collectively known as "Kaivalya sahitya" (or "Tattva Padagalu", literally "songs of the pathway to emancipation"). Shivayogi's songs were reflective, philosophical and concerned with <a href="yoga">yoga</a>. They were written in almost all the native metres of Kannada language with the exception of "shatpadi" metre.

Shivayogi's other writings include a scientific encyclopedia called "Vivekachintamani", so well regarded that it was translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century. The writing categorises 1,500 topics based on subject and covers a wide array such as poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics. His translation of the "Shiva Yoga Pradipika" from Sanskrit was done to elucidate the <a href="Shaiva">Shaiva</a> philosophy and benefit those ignorant of the original language.

In the post-Vijayanagara era, the "Kaivalya" tradition branched three ways. The first consisted of followers of the Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch that kept the "vachana" tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this "vachana" tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the "Subodhasara"; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it still needs to be studied.

Phan Xích Long

Phan Xích Long, also known as Hồng Long, born Phan Phát Sanh (1893–1916), was a 20th-century <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> mystic and <a href="geomancy">geomancer</a> who claimed to be the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Vietnam">Emperor of Vietnam</a>. He attempted to exploit religion as a cover for his own political ambitions, having started his own ostensibly religious organisation. Claiming to be a descendant of Emperor <a href="H%C3%A0m%20Nghi">Hàm Nghi</a>, Long staged a ceremony to crown himself, before trying to seize power in 1913 by launching an armed uprising against the colonial rule of <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>. His supporters launched an attack on <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a> in March 1913, drinking potions that purportedly made them invisible and planting bombs at several locations. The insurrection against the French colonial administration failed when none of the bombs detonated and the supposedly invisible supporters were apprehended.

The French authorities imprisoned Long and many of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the <a href="1916%20Cochinchina%20uprising">1916 Cochinchina uprising</a>s against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a>, a major religious sect in Vietnam.

Long was born in 1893 in southern Vietnam as Phan Phát Sanh. His place of birth is disputed; the historians R. B. Smith and Hue-Tam Ho Tai say that he was from <a href="Cholon%2C%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Cholon</a>, the <a href="Hoa%20people">Chinese</a> business district of <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, while Oscar Chapuis records <a href="Tan%20An">Tan An</a> as his place of birth. Sanh's father was a police officer. and it has been speculated that the family were of Chinese descent. He started as a servant in a French family, before travelling to the <a href="That%20Son">That Son</a> ("Seven Mountains") region in the far south of Vietnam, a region that was known as a hotbed of mysticism. There Long trained in mysticism. As a youth, Sanh travelled from <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> to <a href="Siam">Siam</a>, earning his living as a fortune-teller and <a href="geomancer">geomancer</a>.

In mid-1911, Sanh formed a secret society on the unverified pretense that he was a descendant of <a href="H%C3%A0m%20Nghi">Hàm Nghi</a>, the boy emperor of the 1880s. Led by <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20Thuy%E1%BA%BFt">Tôn Thất Thuyết</a> and <a href="Phan%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Ph%C3%B9ng">Phan Đình Phùng</a>—two high-ranking <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarins</a>—<a href="H%C3%A0m%20Nghi">Hàm Nghi</a>'s <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20movement">Cần Vương movement</a> battled against French colonisation in the decade leading up to 1895. Their objective was to expel the French authorities and establish Ham Nghi as the emperor of an independent Vietnam. This failed, and the French exiled the boy emperor to <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, replacing him with his brother <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Đồng Khánh</a>. From then on, the French retained the monarchy of the <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Dynasty">Nguyễn Dynasty</a>, exiling any emperors who rose against colonial rule and replacing them with more cooperative relatives. Sanh also claimed descent from the <a href="L%C3%AA%20Dynasty">Lê Dynasty</a>, which ruled Vietnam in the 15th and 16th centuries. He was a strong warrior, further presenting himself as the founder of <a href="China">China</a>'s <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>.

At the time of Sanh's activities in the 1910s, there were two members of the Nguyễn Dynasty who commanded respect among Vietnamese monarchists. The first was the boy emperor <a href="Duy%20T%C3%A2n">Duy Tân</a>, who was himself deported in 1916 after staging an uprising. Duy Tan's grandfather, Emperor <a href="D%E1%BB%A5c%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Dục Đức</a>, was the adopted son of the childless Emperor <a href="T%E1%BB%B1%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Tự Đức</a>, the last independent emperor of Vietnam. The second figure who was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince <a href="C%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%83">Cường Để</a>. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor <a href="Gia%20Long">Gia Long</a>, who had established the Nguyễn Dynasty and unified Vietnam in its modern state. Cường Để was a prominent anti-colonial activist who lived in exile in Japan.

Sanh's two main assistants were Nguyen Huu Tri and Nguyen Van Hiep, whom he met at <a href="T%C3%A2n%20Ch%C3%A2u%2C%20An%20Giang">Tân Châu</a> in <a href="Ch%C3%A2u%20%C4%90%E1%BB%91c%20Province">Châu Đốc Province</a> (now in An Giang Province). The trio agreed to plot an uprising against the French under the cover of a religious sect. The genesis of their cooperation is unclear, but it may have started before mid-1911. Tri and Hiep were said to have been in awe when Sanh produced a golden plaque that read "heir to the throne". The men agreed that the geographical foci of their movement would be in Cholon and Tan An in Vietnam and <a href="Kampot%20%28town%29">Kampot</a> in Cambodia. The trio decided to model their actions on an uprising that had occurred in Kampot in 1909. On that occasion, a group of Cambodians of Chinese descent had marched into the town wearing white robes, claiming to be followers of a <a href="Battambang">Battambang</a>-based Cambodian prince who would overthrow French rule and lead them to independence. After the formation of the sect, Sanh temporarily moved abroad, spending time in Siam and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>. During this time, he learned sorcery and magic, supplementing his mystical training with a military education. He learned pyrotechnics for the purpose of making fireworks and bombs.

Sanh returned to southern Vietnam, and began dressing as a Buddhist <a href="bhikkhu">monk</a>. He travelled through the six provinces of the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> region. His associates Hiep and Tri found an elderly man from Cholon in Saigon, and presented the senior citizen to the populace as a "<a href="living%20Buddha">living Buddha</a>". After some local elders objected to their activities, they moved to the centre of Cholon. The old man took up residence with Sanh, and peasants and tradespeople soon began flocking to their makeshift temple, located in a house in Cholon's Thuan Kieu Street. As their temple was located in a prominent commercial area, the group began to collect more funds. The donors made offerings of gold and silver, with some individual donations being worth as much as 1,500 <a href="French%20Indochinese%20piastre">piastres</a>. When the "living Buddha" unexpectedly died in February 1912, he was interred in the family shrine of a notable follower. Sanh's strategists declared that before the old man had died, he named Sanh as the rightful Emperor of Vietnam. In the meantime, the old man's remains became the object of veneration, providing further cover for political plotting and fundraising when visitors came to pay their respects. After the completion of the funeral rites, Sanh and his followers staged an impromptu coronation ceremony at Battambang in October 1912. Sanh took on the name Phan Xích Long and was also known as Hồng Long, both of which mean "red dragon".

Vast crowds of locals began flocking to pay homage to Long, vowing to contribute labour and finance in an effort to expel the French from Vietnam and install Long as the independent monarch. By this time, Long was claiming to have received a letter from Cuong De, which supposedly confirmed his royal descent. Long's followers spared no expense in decorating Long with royal accoutrements. They made a medallion inscribed "Phan Xích Long Hòang Đế" (Emperor Phan Xích Long) and a royal seal with a dragon's head with the words "Đại Minh Quốc, Phan Xích Long Hòang Đế, Thiên tử" ("Greater Ming State, Emperor Phan Xích Long, Son of Heaven"). The words "Đại Minh" were interpreted as either having arbitrarily been copied from local <a href="Hoa%20people">Chinese Vietnamese</a> secret society slogans, or as a strategic ploy to invoke the names of the <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> to appeal to the Chinese who had emigrated to Vietnam after the fall of the Ming. Long's supporters produced a sword with the inscription "Tiên đả hôn quân, hậu đả loạn thần" ("First strike the debauched king, next the traitorous officials") and a ring inscribed "Dân Công" ("Popular Tribute"). From then on, Long presented himself as the emperor and signed documents under the royal title.

Long's strategy of proclaiming himself as a royal descendent or claiming to have supernatural powers in order to rally support for political ends was not new; it has been repeatedly used throughout Vietnamese history. In 1516, a man calling himself <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20C%E1%BA%A3o%20Rebellion">Trần Cảo rebelled</a> against the <a href="L%C3%AA%20Dynasty">Lê Dynasty</a>, claiming to be a descendant of the deposed <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20Dynasty">Trần Dynasty</a> and a <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of <a href="Indra">Indra</a>. During the 19th century, there was a Buddhist revival and many people masqueraded as monks claiming to have supernatural powers. These false monks were frequently able to start new religious movements and secret societies based on <a href="millenarianism">millenarianism</a>. Quickly gathering large numbers of disciples, they staged rebellions against Vietnamese imperial and French colonial armies alike. However, these uprisings were typically incoherent and caused minimal disruption to the ruling authorities. On the other hand, the French were often troubled by resistance movements in southern Vietnam that were led by more conventionally motivated nationalist militants, such as the guerrilla outfits of <a href="Tr%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh">Trương Định</a> and <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Trung%20Tr%E1%BB%B1c">Nguyễn Trung Trực</a>.

During the time he spent in <a href="Battambang">Battambang</a> for the coronation, Long organised the construction of a pagoda in the town, and in December, he unsuccessfully applied for a land concession. After the coronation, Long was taken to the That Son region in <a href="Ch%C3%A2u%20%C4%90%E1%BB%91c">Châu Đốc</a>, in the far south of the Mekong Delta. There the peasants built a temple for him. They used a small restaurant in a nearby village as a reception centre for the temple, as the temple was increasingly used as a military base, where fighters, weaponry and munitions were being assembled for an uprising. In the village of Tan Thanh, a local leader recruited his peasants for Long's revolt. The village chieftain predicted that a new Vietnamese monarch would descend from the sky at Cholon in March 1913, and that only the royalists would survive this miracle. 

Such proclamations were repeated across southern Vietnam and in Cambodia, and notices were posted in Saigon, <a href="Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a>, the road between the cities, and in many community venues in rural communities. Long's supporters presented them in the form of a royal edict on wooden blocks, declaring their intention to attack French military installations. They called on the people to rise up and topple French rule and said that supernatural forces would aid the independence fighters, saying that an unnamed monk would arrive from the mountains to lead them. At the time, southern Vietnam was beset by heavy <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> labour demands, especially with large-scale roadworks in progress. This meant that the peasants had less time to tend to their farmland, and revolts and strikes had been common. The simmering discontent is seen as a reason for Long's ability to gather such levels of support in a short time. Long's supporters called on merchants to flee and convert their colonial bank notes into solid copper cash. Word of the planned revolt spread quickly, leading to a substantial depreciation in the currency.

Long took the lead in preparing the explosives, telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The bombs were made from cannon shot, <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="sulphur">sulphur</a> and <a href="Potassium%20nitrate">saltpeter</a>, which were then wrapped together.

On March 22, the French arrested Long in the coastal town of <a href="Phan%20Thi%E1%BA%BFt">Phan Thiết</a>, some 160 kilometres to the east of Saigon. His activities and proclamations had attracted the attention of French colonial officials, and just days before, the <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">Resident</a> of Kampot visited the Battambang temple and spotted the collection of white robes, which were similarly styled to the uniforms worn during the 1909 uprising. However, Long's disciples were unaware that he had been arrested and continued with their plot. After nightfall on March 23, the bombs were taken into Saigon and placed at strategic points, with proclamation notices being erected in close proximity. None of the bombs successfully detonated. One source says that the bombs failed because the French authorities had defused all of them after uncovering the conspiracy.

On March 28, the second phase of the operation started when several hundred rebels marched into Saigon dressed all in white, armed with only sticks and spears. Before the march, they had ingested potions that purportedly made them invisible. However, the French military were able to capture more than 80 of the supposedly invisible rebels during demonstrations against French rule. The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.

Those involved were taken before a tribunal in November 1913, where the leaders freely stated their intentions of overthrowing the French colonial regime. Of the 111 people arrested, the tribunal convicted 104, of whom 63 received prison sentences. During the trial, some community leaders wrote to the Governor-General of Indochina, blaming French oppression of the populace through corvee labour and the confiscation of land, for the discontent that led to the uprising. The prosecutor also criticised the way in which colonial authorities operated.

<a href="Antoine%20Georges%20Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e%20Ernest%20Outrey">Ernest Outrey</a>, the French Governor of <a href="Cochinchina">Cochinchina</a>, the southern region of Vietnam, was known for his support of colonial enterprise and rigid rule of the colony. He was unmoved by claims that the uprising had been fuelled by a sense of injustice. He said

The governor went on to excoriate the French press for their criticism of colonial policy, claiming that they boosted the morale of anti-colonial activists. The prosecutor thought that because Long's movement was affiliated with the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Nam%20Quang%20Ph%E1%BB%A5c%20H%E1%BB%99i">Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội</a> (VNQPH), an exiled monarchist organisation led by the leading anti-colonial activist <a href="Phan%20B%E1%BB%99i%20Ch%C3%A2u">Phan Bội Châu</a>, and Cường Để. The suspicion was based on the fact that the VNQPH had printed their own currency and circulated them into Vietnam at the same time that Long's monetary policy had led to a depreciation. Cường Để had also secretly re-entered southern Vietnam and had been travelling through the countryside when Long's uprising was launched in March. The prosecutor claimed that activists from northern and central Vietnam, the main source of the VNQPH's followers, were behind the plot. The defendants denied this, asserting that most of the participants were "illiterate peasants", while the VNQPH were dominated by members of the scholar-gentry.

The French intended to deport Long to <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans. As a result, Long remained in Saigon Central Prison, serving his life sentence with hard labour. The French were unaware that Long was still in contact with his supporters.

Over time, resentment against French rule rose again, due to World War I. The colonial authorities had forced each village to send a quota of men to serve on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. In Vietnam, rumours circulated, claiming that France was close to defeat. Believing that the colonial hold had been weakened by the strain of war in Europe, Vietnamese nationalists were buoyed. In February 1916, <a href="1916%20Cochinchina%20uprising">uprisings broke out in southern Vietnam</a>, with rebels demanding the restoration of an independent monarchy. One of their many objectives was to secure Long's release by breaking down Saigon prison, and this was the most noted incident during the tumult. 

Attacks on prisons were not uncommon in French Indochina, as rebels often viewed the prisoners as a source of reinforcements. Georges Coulet, regarded as French Indochina's leading scholar on anti-French religious movements, said that "The attack on Saigon Central Prison was not simply an attempt to release the pseudo-Emperor, Phan Xich Long, but was intended to deliver all prisoners".

Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese wearing white headbands, white trousers and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near the centre of Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting on the outskirts of Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for the main part of the uprising.

The advance party then attempted to proceed to the Central Prison to forcibly release Long, shouting "Let's free big Brother [Long]". Long had provided his followers with a detailed strategy from his prison cell, and the attack was led by a Cholon gang leader named Nguyen Van Truoc (also known as Tu Mat) with Tri's assistance. Truoc was the leader of a powerful underworld gang that was linked to the <a href="Heaven%20and%20Earth%20Society">Heaven and Earth Society</a>. 

The French had anticipated the trouble, and police, whose presence had been increased along the waterways, arrived quickly, dispersing Long's followers with ease. Although some of the disciples reached the prison, none managed to breach its defenses. Ten of Long's men were killed, whereas only one sentry perished. The French arrested 65 rebels on the spot, including Tri. Of these, 38 were sentenced to death. Long was sentenced to death for his participation in the uprising, and he was executed on February 22, 1916. The French Governor-General of Indochina wrote to the French Minister of Colonies, describing the incident as "a serious attempt to put in execution a vast plot that has been prepared carefully and for a long time by a secret society which grouped together with professional bandits all the enemies of our domination". The colonial authorities commissioned the publication of poems, which praised French rule and warned the populace against insurrections.

Similar events occurred across southern Vietnam, and in one case in <a href="B%E1%BA%BFn%20Tre">Bến Tre</a>, another self-proclaimed mystic launched an uprising that was similar to Long's 1913 effort. In all, riots or uprisings broke out in 13 of the 20 provinces of Cochinchina. The French declared a state of emergency and continued their crackdown against Long's followers and other rebels, making a further 1,660 arrests, which resulted in 261 incarcerations.

The damage inflicted on Long's organisation led many of his followers to disperse and join a group that has now developed into the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> politico-religious sect based in <a href="T%C3%A2y%20Ninh">Tây Ninh</a>. Nevertheless, Long's uprising was significant because of its abnormal roots. It was the first uprising led by a self-styled religious leader whose support base came about due to man-made discontent. Prior to Long, peasant uprisings with religious themes had always been preceded by floods, outbreaks of disease, famine, crop failure or other natural phenomena, as sections of the rural populace attributed such disasters to the wrath of the heavens and sought help from leaders who purported to have supernatural powers. 

Long's demise did not end the sequence of self-proclaimed mystics who raised armies and engaged in politics. During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, a sorcerer named Chem Keo claimed to be Long's reincarnation. During World War II, <a href="Hu%E1%BB%B3nh%20Ph%C3%BA%20S%E1%BB%95">Huỳnh Phú Sổ</a> claimed to be a living Buddha and quickly gathered more than a million supporters. He raised a large peasant army and battled both the French and the communist <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> independence movement, before being killed by the latter. In another case in 1939, a <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> attempted to demonstrate that he was immune to French bullets. Furthermore, in the years immediately after World War II, the Cao Đài's numbers swelled to 1.5 million.

Phan Xich Long is a quickly developing street at the junction of Districts 1, Binh Thanh, and Phu Nhuan.

The Good Terrorist

The Good Terrorist is a 1985 <a href="political%20fiction">political novel</a> written by the British novelist <a href="Doris%20Lessing">Doris Lessing</a>. It was first published in September that year by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in the United Kingdom and by <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a> in the United States. The book's protagonist is the naïve drifter Alice, who <a href="squatting">squats</a> with a group of radicals in London and is drawn into their <a href="terrorism">terrorist</a> activities.

Lessing was spurred to write "The Good Terrorist" by the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) <a href="Harrods%20bombings">bombing</a> of the <a href="Harrods">Harrods</a> department store in London in 1983. She had been a member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a>, but left after the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">1956 Hungarian uprising</a>. Some reviewers labelled the novel a <a href="satire">satire</a>, while Lessing called it humorous. The title is an <a href="oxymoron">oxymoron</a> which highlights Alice's ambivalent nature.

"The Good Terrorist" divided reviewers. Some praised its insight and characterisation, others faulted its style and the characters' lack of depth. One critic complimented Lessing's "strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterisations", another her "brilliant account of the types of individuals who commit terrorist acts", yet another called it "surprisingly bland", and the characters "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions". "The Good Terrorist" was shortlisted for the <a href="Man%20Booker%20Prize">Booker Prize</a>, and won the and the <a href="WH%20Smith%20Literary%20Award">WH Smith Literary Award</a>.

"The Good Terrorist" is written in the <a href="Narration%23Third-person">subjective third person</a> from the point of view of Alice, an unemployed politics and economics graduate in her mid-thirties who drifts from commune to commune. She is trailed by Jasper, a graduate she took in at a student commune she lived in fifteen years previously, who sponges off her. Alice fell in love with him, only to become frustrated by his aloofness and burgeoning homosexuality. She considers herself a revolutionary, fighting against "fascist imperialism", but is still dependent on her parents, whom she treats with contempt. In the early 1980s, Alice joins a <a href="squatting">squat</a> of like-minded "comrades" in a derelict house in London. Other members of the squat include Bert, its ineffective leader, and a lesbian couple, the maternal Roberta and her unstable and fragile partner Faye.

The abandoned house is in a state of disrepair and earmarked by the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">City Council</a> for demolition. In the face of the indifference of her comrades, Alice takes it upon herself to clean up and renovate the house. She also persuades the authorities to restore the electricity and water supplies. Alice becomes the house's "mother", cooking for everyone, and dealing with the local police, who are trying to evict them. The members of the squat belong to the Communist Centre Union (CCU), and attend demonstrations and pickets. Alice involves herself in some of these activities, but spends most of her time working on the house.

To be more useful to the struggle, Jasper and Bert travel to Ireland and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> to offer their services to the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) and the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>, but are turned down. A more organised group of revolutionaries moves in next door and start using Alice's house as a conduit for arms, to which Alice objects. Mysterious strangers visit the squat and question their decision making.

The comrades eventually decide to act on their own, calling themselves "Freeborn British Communists". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because "[o]rdinary people simply didn't understand". She acknowledges that she is a terrorist now, though she cannot remember when the change happened.

<a href="Doris%20Lessing">Doris Lessing</a>'s interest in politics began in the 1940s while she was living in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> (now <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>). She was attracted to a group of "quasi-Communist[s]" and joined the chapter of the <a href="Left%20Book%20Club">Left Book Club</a> in Salisbury (now <a href="Harare">Harare</a>). Later, prompted by the conflicts arising from <a href="Racial%20segregation%23Rhodesia">racial segregation</a> prominent in Rhodesia at the time, she also joined the <a href="Rhodesia%20Labour%20Party">Southern Rhodesian Labour Party</a>. Lessing moved to London in 1949 and began her writing career there. She became a member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a> in the early 1950s, and was an active campaigner <a href="Anti-nuclear%20movement">against the use of nuclear weapons</a>.

By 1964, Lessing had published six novels, but grew disillusioned with Communism following the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">1956 Hungarian uprising</a> and, after reading "<a href="The%20Sufis">The Sufis</a>" by <a href="Idries%20Shah">Idries Shah</a>, turned her attention to <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>, an Islamic belief system. This prompted her to write her five-volume "space fiction" series, "<a href="Canopus%20in%20Argos">Canopus in Argos: Archives</a>", which drew on Sufi concepts. The series was not well received by some of her readers, who felt she had abandoned her "rational worldview".

"The Good Terrorist" was Lessing's first book to be published after the "Canopus in Argos" series, which prompted several retorts from reviewers, including, "Lessing has returned to Earth", and "Lessing returns to reality". Several commentators have labelled "The Good Terrorist" as a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. She said:

[I]t's not a book with a political statement. It's ... about a certain kind of political person, a kind of self-styled revolutionary that can only be produced by affluent societies. There's a great deal of playacting that I don't think you'd find in extreme left revolutionaries in societies where they have an immediate challenge.

Lessing said she was inspired to write "The Good Terrorist" by the <a href="Harrods%20bombings">IRA bombing of the Harrods department store</a> in London in 1983. She recalled, "the media reported it to sound as if it was the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" and realised "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of ... maternal caring, ... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." She described Alice as "quietly comic[al]" because she is so full of contradictions. She said she was surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, who turned out to be a "destroyed person".

"The Good Terrorist" has been labelled a "political novel" by the publishers and some reviewers, including <a href="Alison%20Lurie">Alison Lurie</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>". Lurie stated that as <a href="political%20fiction">political fiction</a>, it is "one of the best novels ... about the terrorist mentality" since <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s "<a href="The%20Secret%20Agent">The Secret Agent</a>" (1907), although this was questioned by William H. Pritchard in "<a href="The%20Hudson%20Review">The Hudson Review</a>", who wrote that compared to Conrad, "The Good Terrorist" is "shapeless". Several commentators have called it more a novel about politics than political fiction. In "From the Margins of Empire: Christina Stead, Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer", Louise Yelin called the work a novel about politics, rather than a political novel "per se".

"The Good Terrorist" has also been called a satire. In her book "Doris Lessing: The Poetics of Change", Gayle Greene called it a "satire of a group of revolutionaries", and Susan Watkins, writing in "Doris Lessing: Border Crossings", described it as a "dry and satirical examination of a woman's involvement with a left-wing splinter group". A biography of Lessing for the <a href="Swedish%20Academy">Swedish Academy</a> on the occasion of her being awarded the 2007 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> called it "a satirical picture of the need of the contemporary left for total control and the female protagonist's misdirected martyrdom and subjugation". Yelin said the novel "oscillat[ed] between satire and nostalgia". Academic Robert E. Kuehn felt that it is not satire at all and that while the book could have been a "satire of the blackest and most hilarious kind", in his opinion Lessing "has no sense of humor, and instead of lashing [the characters] with the satirist's whip, she treats them with unremitting and belittling irony".

Virginia Scott called the novel a fantasy. Drawing on <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" in "The International Fiction Review", she wrote that "[Lessing's] Alice with her group of political revolutionaries can be seen as a serious fantasy which has striking parallels to ... Carroll's <a href="Alice%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Alice</a>". Both Alices enter a house and are confronted by seemingly impossible challenges: Carroll's Alice has to navigate passages too small to fit through, while Lessing's Alice finds herself in a barely inhabitable house that is earmarked for demolition. Both Alices are able to change their appearances: in "Wonderland", Alice adjusts her size to suit her needs; in "The Good Terrorist", Alice changes her demeanour to get what she wants from others. Scott noted that at one point in "The Good Terrorist", Faye refers to Alice as "Alice the Wonder, the wondrous Alice", alluding to Carroll's Alice.

The American novelist <a href="Judith%20Freeman">Judith Freeman</a> wrote that one of the common themes in "The Good Terrorist" is that of keeping one's identity in a <a href="collective">collective</a>, of preserving "individual conscience". This theme suggests that problems occur when we are coerced into conforming. Freeman said that Alice is a "quintessential good woman ... the little "Hausefrau" [sic] revolutionary", who turns bad under peer pressure.

Another theme present is the symbolic nature of the house. Margaret Scanlan stated that as in books like "<a href="Mansfield%20Park">Mansfield Park</a>" and "<a href="Jane%20Eyre">Jane Eyre</a>", "The Good Terrorist" "defines a woman in terms of her house". Writing in the journal "Studies in the Novel", Katherine Fishburn said that Lessing often uses a house to symbolise "psychological or <a href="ontology">ontological</a> change", and that here, "the house ... symbolizes Alice's function in the story". Yelin described "The Good Terrorist" as "an urban, dystopian updating of the house-as-England genre, [where] ... England is represented by a house in London". Writing in "Politics of Feminine Abuse: Political Oppression and Masculine Obstinacy in Doris Lessing's "The Good Terrorist", Lalbakhsh and Yahya suggest that the house, and the "oppressive relations" in it, reflect similar oppressive relations in society.

Several critics have focused on the theme of motherhood. In "Mothers and Daughters/Aging and Dying", Claire Sprague wrote that Lessing often dwells on the theme of mothers passing their behaviours onto their daughters, and how the cycle of daughters fighting their mothers permeates each generation. The British novelist <a href="Jane%20Rogers">Jane Rogers</a> said that "The Good Terrorist" "is as unsparing and incisive about motherhood as it is about the extreme left", and that motherhood here "is terrible": Alice's mother is reduced to despair continually yielding to her selfish daughter's demands; Alice mothers Jasper, and has a similar despairing relationship with him. Rogers added that motherhood is depicted here as a compulsion to protect the weak, despite their propensity to retaliate and hurt you.

<a href="Feminism">Feminist</a> themes and the subjugation of women have also been associated with "The Good Terrorist". Scanlan indicated that while many of the comrades in the book are women, they find that political activity does not elevate their position, and that they are "trapped in the patriarchy they despise". Yelin suggested that although Lessing ridicules the male members of the CCU and their role playing, she is also critical of the female members "who collude in male-dominant political organizations and thus in their own oppression". But with the book's allusions to Jasper's homosexuality, Yelin added that Lessing's "critique of women's infatuation with patriarchal <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a> and their emotional dependence on misogynist men" is muted by <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> and the "misogyny pervasive in patriarchal constructions of (male) heterosexuality". Lalbakhsh and Yahya noted that Lessing depicts Alice as a "typical housewife" who cares for her family, in this case, the squat, but is "ignored and neglected". They concluded that Alice's fate is sealed because, according to the British <a href="Socialist%20feminism">socialist feminist</a> <a href="Juliet%20Mitchell">Juliet Mitchell</a>, women are "fundamental to the human condition", yet "their economic, social, and political roles ... are marginal".

Several critics have called "The Good Terrorist"s title an <a href="oxymoron">oxymoron</a>. Robert Boschman suggested it is indicative of Alice's "contradictory personality" – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In "The Hudson Review", George Kearns wrote that the title "hovers above the novel with ... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the "good terrorist", but that while she may be a good person, she is "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in "<a href="World%20Literature%20Today">World Literature Today</a>", Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in "very domestic-looking fiction", and "direct[ly] challenge[s] ... our sense of reality".

Kuehn described Alice as "well-intentioned, canny and sometimes lovable", but as someone who, at 36, never grew up, and is still dependent on her parents. Yelin said Alice is "in a state of perpetual adolescence", and her need to "mother everyone" is "an extreme case of psychological regression or failure to thrive". Greene wrote that Alice's "humanitarianism is ludicrous in her world", and described her as "so furiously at odds with herself" because she is too immature to comprehend what is happening and her actions vary from being helpful to dangerous.

Boschman called Lessing's narrative "<a href="irony">ironic</a>" because it highlights the divide between who Alice is and who she thinks she is, and her efforts to pretend there is no discrepancy. Alice refuses to acknowledge that her "maternal activities" stem from her desire to win her mother's approval and, believing that her mother has "betrayed and abandoned" her, turns to Jasper as a way to "continue to sustain her beliefs about herself and the world". Even though Jasper takes advantage of her adoration of him by mistreating her, Alice still clings to him because her self-image "vigorously qualifies her perception of [him], and thus proliferates the denial and self-deception". The fact that Jasper has turned to homosexuality, which Alice dismisses as "his emotional life", "suits her own repressed desires". Kuehn called Alice's obsession with the "hapless" and "repellent" Jasper "just comprehensible", adding that she feels safe with his gayness, even though she has to endure his abuse.

Knapp stated that while Lessing exposes self-styled insurrectionists as "spoiled and immature products of the middle class", she also derides their ineptness at affecting any meaningful change. Lessing is critical of the state which "feeds the very hand that terrorizes it", yet she also condemns those institutions that exploits the working class and ignores the homeless. Knapp remarks that Lessing does not resolve these ambiguities, but instead highlights the failings of the state and those seeking to overthrow it. Scanlan compared Lessing's comrades to <a href="Richard%20E.%20Rubenstein">Richard E. Rubenstein</a>'s terrorists in his book "Alchemists of Revolution: Terrorism in the Modern World". Rubenstein wrote that when "ambitious idealists" have no "creative ruling class to follow or a rebellious lower class to lead [they] have often taken upon themselves the burden of representative action", which he said "is a formula for disaster".

Critical opinion has been divided on "The Good Terrorist". Elizabeth Lowry highlighted this in the "<a href="London%20Review%20of%20Books">London Review of Books</a>": "[Lessing] has been sharply criticised for the pedestrian quality of her prose, and as vigorously defended". The Irish literary critic <a href="Denis%20Donoghue%20%28academic%29">Denis Donoghue</a> complained that the style of the novel is "insistently drab", and Kuehn referred to Lessing's text as "surprisingly bland". Lowry noted that the English academic Clare Hanson defended the book by saying that it is "a grey and textureless novel because it ... speaks a grey and textureless language".

Freeman on the other hand called the book a "graceful and accomplished story", and a "brilliant account of the types of individuals who commit terrorist acts". Writing in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", Freeman described Lessing as "one of our most valuable writers" who "has an uncanny grasp of human relationships". In a review in the "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>", Bonnie Gross wrote that it was Lessing's "most accessible" book to date, and that her "strong descriptive prose and her precise and realistic characterizations" made it "remarkable" and "rewarding reading". Gross considered the female characters, particularly Alice, much more developed than the male ones.

Amanda Sebestyen wrote in "The Women's Review of Books" that at first glance the ideas in "The Good Terrorist" appear deceptively simple, and the plot predictable. But she added that Lessing's strength is her "stoic narrat[ion] of the daily effort of living", which excels in describing day-to-day life in a squat. Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who "speak[s] to me most disquietingly about myself and my generation". In a review in "<a href="off%20our%20backs">off our backs</a>", an American feminist publication, Vickie Leonard called "The Good Terrorist" a "fascinating book" that is "extremely well written" with characters that are "exciting" and "realistic". Leonard added that even though Alice is not a feminist, the book illustrates the author's "strong admiration for women and their accomplishments".

Writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Rogers described "The Good Terrorist" as "a novel in unsparing close-up" that examines society through the eyes of individuals. She said it is "witty and ... angry at human stupidity and destructiveness", and within the context of recent terrorist attacks in London, it is an example of "fiction going where factual writing cannot". A critic in "Kirkus Reviews" wrote that Alice's story is "an extraordinary tour de force—a psychological portrait that's realistic with a vengeance". The reviewer added that although Alice is "self-deluding" and not always likeable, the novel's strength are the characters and its depiction of political motivation.

Donoghue wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that he did not care much about what happened to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as "an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are "the salt of the earth or its scum". In a review in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions".

"The Good Terrorist" was shortlisted for the 1985 <a href="Man%20Booker%20Prize">Booker Prize</a>, and in 1986 won the and the <a href="WH%20Smith%20Literary%20Award">WH Smith Literary Award</a>. In 2007 Lessing was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for being "part of both the history of literature and living literature". In the award ceremony speech by Swedish writer <a href="Per%20W%C3%A4stberg">Per Wästberg</a>, "The Good Terrorist" was cited as "an in-depth account of the extreme leftwing squatting culture that sponges off female self-sacrifice". Following Lessing's death in 2013, "The Guardian" put "The Good Terrorist" in their list of the top five Lessing books. Indian writer <a href="Neel%20Mukherjee%20%28writer%29">Neel Mukherjee</a> included the novel in his 2015 "top 10 books about revolutionaries", also published in "The Guardian".

"The Good Terrorist" was first published in September 1985 in hardcover by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in the United Kingdom, and by <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a> in the United States. The first paperback edition was published in the United Kingdom in September 1986 by <a href="Grafton%20%28publisher%29">Grafton</a>. An unabridged 13-hour <a href="audiobook">audio cassette edition</a>, narrated by Nadia May, was released in the United States in April 1999 by <a href="Blackstone%20Audio">Blackstone Audio</a>. The novel has been translated into several other languages including Catalan, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish.

John McCauley

<a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir John Patrick Joseph McCauley, <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">KBE</a>, <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a> (18 March 1899 – 3 February 1989) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1954 to 1957. A <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Duntroon</a> graduate, McCauley spent four years in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a> before transferring to the RAAF in 1924. He was Director of Training from 1936 to 1938, and commanded engineering and flying training schools for the first eighteen months of World War II. Having been promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in 1940, he was posted to Singapore in June 1941 to take charge of all RAAF units defending the area. He earned praise for his efforts in attacking invading Japanese forces before the <a href="fall%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a>, and for his dedication in evacuating his men. After serving as <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1942–44, he was appointed to a senior operational role with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">2nd Tactical Air Force</a> in Europe, where he saw out the rest of the war.

Following the end of hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and appointed <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a> at <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters</a> in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a> and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighted</a> a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a> and recommending purchase of a light <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> bomber to replace the Air Force's <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1989, aged 89.

Born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 18 March 1899, McCauley went to school at <a href="St%20Joseph%27s%20College%2C%20Hunters%20Hill">St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill</a>, before entering the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1916. He graduated as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in 1919, and spent the next four years in staff positions with the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Permanent Military Forces</a>, including a posting to Britain. In January 1924, he transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, undertaking the pilots' course at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria. He was nicknamed "Black Jack" in tribute to his dark looks, but a "shaky reputation" as an aviator also earned him the epithet "Crasher". On 10 November 1925, he married Murielle Burke; the couple had a son and two daughters. By 1926, McCauley was back in Britain, studying at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Greenwich">Royal Naval College, Greenwich</a>, and the RAF Armament and Gunnery School. He returned to Australia in 1928, and was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>.

Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, McCauley was posted a third time to Britain in 1933, graduating from <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, and qualifying as a <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a> at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School">Central Flying School</a>, <a href="RAF%20Wittering">Wittering</a>. The following year he was attached to the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> in London. Returning to Australia in 1935, McCauley joined the RAAF's Directorate of Training. That September, he initiated a requirement for all air bases to draw up plans for local defence. He also inaugurated operational-level policy for the Air Force, ordering units to draft doctrine relevant to their combat roles, such as "Striking" for <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> and "Army Co-operation" for <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>. Described as "a great leader, with a great deal of force", McCauley took over as Director of Training in 1936. He gained his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Commerce">Bachelor of Commerce</a> degree at <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">Melbourne University</a> the same year, having studied part-time since 1929. His tertiary qualification was unusual for a general duties officer in the pre-war Air Force, whose pilots generally "valued little beyond flying ability". By 1939 he had been raised to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> and was commanding officer and chief flying instructor of the cadet wing at Point Cook.

McCauley's seniority and instructional experience kept him in Australia on training assignments for the first eighteen months of World War II. From March to October 1940, he served as the inaugural commander of No. 1 Engineering School at <a href="Ascot%20Vale%2C%20Victoria">Ascot Vale</a>, Victoria. Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, he then took over <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Service Flying Training School</a> at Point Cook until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander <a href="Elwyn%20King">Elwyn King</a>. During McCauley's tenure, the number of aircraft operated by the school doubled from its initial complement of 52, and monthly flying hours increased from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800.

During the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan Campaign</a> in 1941–42, McCauley was in charge of RAAF units under Britain's <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">Far East Air Force</a> (FEAF). As station commander at <a href="Sembawang%20Air%20Base">RAF Sembawang</a> in north-east Singapore from August 1941, he personally supervised the training and operations of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 1</a> and <a href="No.%208%20Squadron%20RAAF">8 Squadrons</a>, flying <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> light bombers. He also warned Air Chief Marshal <a href="Robert%20Brooke-Popham">Sir Robert Brooke-Popham</a>, the FEAF's Commander-in-Chief, of the weaknesses of the Allied air defences. Deployed to forward bases on the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>, McCauley's Hudsons were the first Allied aircraft to spot Japanese troop transports converging off <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a> on 6 December, and they attacked the fleet in the face of heavy defensive fire. By Christmas, as the Allies retreated from Malaya, Sembawang was "the busiest airfield on Singapore island", with two Dutch <a href="Glenn%20Martin%20Company">Glenn Martin bomber</a> squadrons in addition to the remnants of the Hudson units, along with <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 21</a> and <a href="No.%20453%20Squadron%20RAAF">453 Squadrons</a> (merged due to losses as No. 21/453 Squadron), operating obsolescent <a href="Brewster%20Buffalo">Brewster Buffalo</a>s. On 29 January 1942, McCauley took over airfield P.2 near <a href="Palembang">Palembang</a> in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, commanding all Commonwealth air operations emanating from the base. With his available aircraft augmented by <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s and <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a>s, he conducted attacks on enemy convoys before evacuating the area on 15 February 1942, the day that <a href="Fall%20of%20Singapore">Singapore surrendered</a>. After communications between himself and local RAF group headquarters were cut, McCauley was left to his own devices to make final arrangements for the demolition of equipment and departure of staff. He had earlier intervened to prevent RAF headquarters from dissolving No. 21 Squadron and using its personnel as a labour force on Sumatra, instead arranging their transport as a unit to <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a>, where they subsequently embarked for Australia. McCauley led the last party to depart Palembang, and was praised for organising the safe passage back to Australia of many Commonwealth air force personnel.
After his return to Australia late in February 1942, McCauley briefly served as Senior Air Staff Officer at <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Headquarters</a> in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. He took up the position of <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> (DCAS) in May, and was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the 1943 <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a>, promulgated on 2 June. The honour recognised the "courage, ability, and qualities of leadership" he displayed under "trying and difficult conditions during a period of service in the Far East". The following month, he was promoted to temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>. During an inspection of <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">No. 10 Group</a> at <a href="Lae%20Nadzab%20Airport">Nadzab</a> in March 1944, McCauley learned that unless the Australian formation was able to increase its operational rate of effort, its units would be withdrawn from their forward airfields. As a result, RAAF Headquarters increased the supply of pilots and equipment to the group, which was then able to meet, and later exceed, the rate of effort achieved by comparable US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> units. At around this time, he also instigated a research program to determine a suitable formula for rotating and relieving <a href="groundcrew">ground staff</a>, as well as <a href="aircrew">aircrew</a>, in the tropics.

Completing his term as DCAS, McCauley was posted to the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European theatre</a> in November 1944, serving for the remainder of the war as Air Commodore (Operations), <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">2nd Tactical Air Force RAF</a> (2nd TAF). The British had actively sought him for this particular appointment, which he commenced in December at the formation's <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> headquarters. The role involved him in the direction of over 70 Commonwealth and European squadrons in operations against Germany, and was "unique" for an RAAF officer during the war. He left 2nd TAF in July 1945 and returned to Australia later that year.

Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders earmarked for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following the cessation of hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>, he was <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a> to Lieutenant General <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a> at <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a> and <a href="Alan%20Charlesworth">Alan Charlesworth</a> respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a>. During the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a>, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, to ensure that they would operate with a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.

In January 1952, Air Marshal Jones was succeeded by Air Marshal <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Sir Donald Hardman</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. The decision by Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> to appoint a British officer as CAS caused controversy in Australia, compounded by his stated reason that there was "no RAAF officer of sufficient age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which ignored the wartime records of figures like McCauley. Hardman changed the structure of the Air Force from one based on geographical area to one based on function, hence McCauley's Eastern Area Command evolved into Home Command (now <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>) in 1953. Promoted to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a>, McCauley took over from Hardman as Chief of the Air Staff when the latter's two-year appointment ended in January 1954. According to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, McCauley was "just as ready to become CAS in 1952 as he was in 1954", while a contemporary observer declared that "seldom has a better-equipped officer led a branch of the Australian services". He was the first of four former Duntroon cadets to successively head up the Air Force between 1954 and 1969, followed by Air Marshals <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Valston Hancock</a>, and <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>.
McCauley was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1955 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. In October 1956, he gave a presentation on air power concepts that was attended by Prime Minister Menzies, as well as the other Australian service chiefs. McCauley identified Malaya and Indochina, particularly <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, as likely areas for future RAAF deployments, advocating a continued presence in Singapore in view of its strategic importance to the defence of Australia, as he had witnessed first-hand during World War II. He also recommended that a <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> light bomber replace the straight-winged and obsolescent <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>, primarily for <a href="interdiction">interdiction</a> in Southeast Asia. McCauley's tenure as CAS saw the beginning of a trend for the RAAF to equip with US aircraft types in preference to British types, with recommendations being put forward for the <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a> (though in the event the French <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a> was purchased) and <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a>. This stemmed partly from his inspection of Allied air force units during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, when he observed that those employing American hardware were far better served with spare parts and replacement aircraft than those with British equipment. Some of his senior commanders had urged replacing the Canberra with <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> heavy bombers, but McCauley did not pursue this option, preferring to concentrate in the short term on new fighter technology. He also made a point of supporting the Australian aircraft industry wherever feasible.

McCauley instigated the redevelopment of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> as the first stage of a forward defence strategy. He aimed to make Darwin the "main Australian base for war" and a launching point for deployments to Southeast Asia, rather than simply a transit station. Over the next ten years, <a href="No.%205%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron</a> transformed the base's runways, buildings and other infrastructure into a modern facility capable of handling major operations. This concept was taken another step by McCauley's successor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, who conceived a series of front-line <a href="RAAF%20Bare%20Bases">"bare bases"</a> across Northern Australia, beginning with plans for <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Base Tindal</a> in 1959. Alan Stephens later described McCauley and Scherger as "among the RAAF's better chiefs".

After his retirement from the RAAF on 18 March 1957, McCauley became active in community welfare organisations, chairing campaigns for the <a href="National%20Heart%20Foundation%20of%20Australia">National Heart Foundation</a>, <a href="Freedom%20From%20Hunger">Freedom From Hunger</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Humane%20Society%20of%20Australasia">Royal Humane Society</a>, and the <a href="Cancer%20Council%20Australia">Cancer Council</a> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. From 1964 until 1974, he served as Federal President of the Air Force Association. In this role he endorsed the initial proposal, featuring monumental statues of airmen and ground crew, for the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force%20Memorial">Royal Australian Air Force Memorial</a> to be located on <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade, Canberra</a>. The design ultimately approved by the final selection panel, however, was an abstract sculpture that was subsequently described as reflecting a "comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service". McCauley visited RAAF units in <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a> in October 1966. In 1970, he played a leading role in organising the Australian Services Council (later the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council) to co-ordinate <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a> efforts for various veterans' groups, and became its first chairman. He was also President of the Good Neighbour Council of New South Wales from 1966 to 1975.

McCauley died in Sydney's <a href="St%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Sydney">St Vincent's Hospital</a> on 3 February 1989, following a stroke. Aged 89, he was survived by his three children; his wife had died two years earlier. He was buried in <a href="Macquarie%20Park%20Cemetery%20and%20Crematorium">Northern Suburbs Cemetery</a>.

Walter de Coventre

Walter de Coventre (died 1371 or 1372) was a 14th-century Scottish <a href="Ecclesiology">ecclesiastic</a>. There is no direct evidence of his birthdate, his family, or his family's origin, although he may have come from the region around <a href="Abernethy%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Abernethy</a> (in modern-day <a href="Perth%20and%20Kinross">Perth and Kinross</a>), where a family with the name de Coventre is known to have lived. Walter appeared in the records for the first time in the 1330s, as a student at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>. From there he went on to the <a href="University%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">University of Orléans</a>, initially as a student before becoming a lecturer there. He studied <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>, <a href="Civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil law</a> and <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, and was awarded many <a href="university%20degree">university degree</a>s, including two <a href="doctorate">doctorate</a>s. His studies were paid for, at least partially, by his <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s in Scotland. Despite holding perhaps more than five benefices at one stage, he did not return to Scotland until the late 1350s.

Following his return to Scotland, Walter soon became <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29">Dean</a> of <a href="St%20Machar%27s%20Cathedral">Aberdeen Cathedral</a>. From there he became engaged in high-level ecclesiastical affairs with the Scottish church and political affairs with <a href="Domhnall%20II%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mar">the Earl of Mar</a>. Sometime before June 1361, the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> of <a href="Dunblane">Dunblane</a> elected him <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</a>. He went to <a href="France">France</a> to secure confirmation from the Pope at <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>, who authorised his <a href="consecration">consecration</a>. Walter was bishop for 10 years after returning home to Scotland. Records of his episcopate are thin, but there are enough to allow a modest reconstruction of his activities: he presided over legal disputes, issued a dispensation for an important irregular marriage, attended parliaments, and acted as an envoy of the Scottish crown in England. He died in either 1371 or 1372.

Walter de Coventre was typical of a new class of men in 14th-century Scotland, the university-educated career cleric from the lower nobility. Such men often acquired university education through their family resources, through the patronage of more substantial nobles, or through church influence, particularly support from the <a href="pope">pope</a> and his court. Patronage gave access to the resources needed to finance the considerable expense of a 14th-century university education, particularly through the presentation of <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s, gifts of land or income made by the church.

Scotland had no universities in de Coventre's time, requiring travel either to <a href="England">England</a> or <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continental Europe</a> to acquire a university education. Continental Europe, particularly <a href="France">France</a>, was the favoured destination, partly because of bad relations between Scotland and England. After their university education, some Scottish graduates chose to remain abroad and teach at a foreign university or to serve the papacy; most returned to Scotland and offered their services to the king, a magnate, or an ecclesiastical institution. The ultimate reward for such services was a bishopric, which brought wealth, prestige, and a "job for life".

Walter de Coventre's life is not well documented. There are no biographies, and no histories or chronicles devote any space to him. His activities can be traced only through a small number of incidental references in legal deeds, church documents and papal records. No modern historian has written a monograph about him, and the most extensive attempt to reconstruct his life in modern literature is a two-page entry in "Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Graduates to A.D. 1410" (1977). <a href="James%20Hutchison%20Cockburn">James Hutchison Cockburn</a>, in his "Medieval Bishop of Dunblane and their Church" (1959) devoted seven less extensively sourced pages, but they emphasized the analysis of a few events during de Coventre's episcopate, and the events of his time.

During most of de Coventre's recorded lifetime Scotland was ruled by King <a href="David%20II%20of%20Scotland">David II</a>. Coming to the throne at age five, King David was driven into exile in France at the age of ten. In the 1330s, civil war raged in Scotland as those loyal to David fought <a href="Edward%20Balliol">Edward Balliol</a> and his English backers. In some sense, the conflict became a side-show of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, and David resided at <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20Gaillard">Château Gaillard</a> in northern France for much of his exile, until he could return to Scotland in 1341. In 1346, in response to a plea from France to come to its aid, David led an army into England only to be taken prisoner at <a href="Battle%20of%20Neville%27s%20Cross">Neville's Cross</a>; he remained in captivity until he was ransomed in 1357. David's exile in France corresponded with Walter's own period in that country, prompting one historian to suggest that Walter was part of David's court while both were in northern France, and that Walter subsequently benefited from the relationship.

James Hutchison Cockburn, a historian of Dunblane's medieval bishops, assumed that Walter's surname derived from the town of <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a> in England. D. E. R. Watt has suggested that the medieval settlement of "Coventre" or "Covintrie" near <a href="Abernethy%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Abernethy</a> in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Dunblane">diocese of Dunblane</a> was the origin of the name.

There is no direct evidence of de Coventre's family, but two other men bearing the name "de Coventre" are known to have been active during Walter's lifetime. A "John de Coventre" is found registered as a student at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> on 21 January 1331. Before December 1341, when he resigned, John de Coventre held the <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of <a href="Inverarity">Inverarity</a>, <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus</a>, in the <a href="diocese%20of%20St%20Andrews">diocese of St Andrews</a>. On 7 December 1345, a William de Coventre, also from the diocese of Dunblane, held a <a href="canonry">canonry</a> and <a href="prebend">prebend</a>s (a cathedral priesthood with stipends) in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ross%20%28Scotland%29">diocese of Ross</a> and the <a href="Collegiate%20Church">Collegiate Church</a> of Abernethy, when he was granted the church of Inverarity that had previously been held by John de Coventre. William thus appears to have succeeded John (and later Walter succeeded William) to all of these benefices.

Watt suggested that all three were brothers, John the first-born, William the second-born, and Walter the youngest of the three. He further suggested that the family was probably closely connected to Margaret de Abernethy, heiress of the <a href="Lord%20of%20Abernethy">old lay abbots and lords of Abernethy</a>. Margaret had patronage over both the church of Abernethy and, as probable owner of the barony of Inverarity, the church there.

De Coventre received a <a href="B.%20A.">B. A.</a> under <a href="John%20de%20Waltirstone">John de Waltirstone</a> from the University of Paris by <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, 1333. Although he had probably completed a Licentiate in <a href="the%20Arts">the Arts</a> and a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Scotland%29">Master of Arts</a> by 1335, because of gaps in the Paris records it is not certain that he was a Master until April 1345.

He moved on to study <a href="civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">University of Orléans</a>, and by 24 March 1337, he was serving as the <a href="proctor">proctor</a> of the Scottish <a href="Nation%20%28university%20corporation%29">Nation</a> in Orléans. By 7 December 1345, he had received a Licentiate in Civil Law. On 20 December 1348 he was at <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a> as an envoy of his university, and while there he obtained a grace regarding his own benefice holding from <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VI">Pope Clement VI</a>. On 7 October 1349, Pope Clement granted an <a href="indult">indult</a> to Walter allowing him to be absent from his <a href="Cure%20%28religion%29">cure</a> while he continued his studies at Orléans.

He may already have been a <a href="Doctorate">Doctor</a> of Civil Law by that point, because in the following year, on 22 November 1350, he is found as such acting as the Regent of Orléans presenting a candidate for <a href="License%23Academia">licence</a>. Having studied civil law for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>. By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law). This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20VI">Pope Innocent VI</a> another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. ("doctor utriusque juris"), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.

Walter's first known benefices were a canonry (with prebend) in the Collegiate Church of <a href="Abernethy%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Abernethy</a> and a prebend in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ross%20%28Scotland%29">diocese of Ross</a>, northern Scotland, which he was holding by 12 April 1345. None of these benefices, neither <a href="parish">parish</a> nor office, are known by name. While Walter would retain his Ross benefice until becoming <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</a>, he lost his Abernethy benefice at some point between 20 December 1348 and 28 March 1351. During that period he obtained another unnamed prebend in exchange for the Abernethy prebend. Walter is only the second known canon of Abernethy Collegiate Church.

On 12 April 1345, he was granted a canonry in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Dunkeld">diocese of Dunkeld</a> with expectation of a prebend, but does not appear to have obtained this in practice, although he did obtain a different Dunkeld canonry with prebend on 12 May 1352. This he retained until his consecration as Bishop of Dunblane in 1361. Walter also obtained a fourth prebend in this period. He had been pursuing a benefice in the diocese of St Andrews, and while he was granted this on 28 March 1351, the grant was still not effective by 16 April 1353, when he was granted a prebend in the diocese of Moray instead. This was not effective either, but Walter did eventually obtain a St Andrews diocese benefice, namely the church of Inverarity in Angus, which had become vacant on the death of its incumbent, William de Coventre, probably Walter's older brother. On 7 December 1345, Walter was appointed (provided) as <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Dunblane">Archdeacon of Dunblane</a>, his most substantial benefice to date, but the appointment does not appear to have been carried through.

Walter obtained one more benefice during this period. On 20 December 1348, he was made <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29">Dean</a> of <a href="St%20Machar%27s%20Cathedral">Aberdeen Cathedral</a>, a high-ranking office which Walter was not technically eligible to hold without a papal grace, being only a <a href="sub-deacon">sub-deacon</a> in orders. The deanery had been made vacant by the death of the long-serving Gilbert Fleming. Although in July the Pope had given it as an extra prebend for <a href="Annibald%20de%20Ceccano">Annibald de Ceccano</a>, <a href="Cardinal%20Bishop%20of%20Tusculum">Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum</a>, this had been cancelled by 20 December, when it was given to Walter instead.

These benefices provided an income without the obligation to perform any pastoral services. Their revenues were assigned to pay for his studies, leaving poorly paid <a href="vicar">vicar</a>s to carry out the pastoral work. Walter remained as a teacher and official at Orléans, perhaps without returning to Scotland at all, until the late 1350s, by when he would have been absent from his native country for more than 25 years. In an Aberdeen document dated 12 July 1356, it was noted that he was still absent from his post.

Walter cannot be traced back in Scotland with certainty before his appearance as a witness to a <a href="charter">charter</a> of <a href="Thomas%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mar">Thomas, Earl of Mar</a>, on 9 July 1358. He may have returned a year earlier, as a document dated sometime between November 1357 and April 1359 records him in the <a href="sheriffdom">sheriffdom</a> of <a href="Forfar">Forfar</a> (<a href="royal%20demesne">royal demesne</a> in Angus) assisting a <a href="justice%20ayre">justice ayre</a>. He appears again on 4 September 1359, witnessing another charter of Earl Thomas at the latter's residence of <a href="Kildrummy%20Castle">Kildrummy Castle</a>.

Following the death in 1361 of <a href="William%20de%20Cambuslang">William de Cambuslang</a>, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter was elected by the Dunblane <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> to be the new bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, it was probably the diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.

Walter, bishop-elect, travelled to the papal court at Avignon, and was provided (appointed) as bishop by Pope Innocent on 18 June 1361. The papal letter of provision expressed displeasure that the chapter (by electing) and Walter (by accepting the election) were ignoring a previous papal reservation of the bishopric. Pope Innocent quashed the election, but nevertheless agreed to appoint (provide) Walter to the bishopric.

Walter may have been consecrated soon after, probably by 23 August. It was on that date that he presented a roll of petitions to the Pope on behalf of several Scotsmen, including <a href="Michael%20de%20Monymusk">Michael de Monymusk</a>, future <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunkeld">Bishop of Dunkeld</a>. On 20 September, Bishop Walter made a "promise of services" to the papacy, the first payment of which was delivered to Avignon in 1363 by Walter's proctor.

Walter had returned to Scotland by 30 June 1362, when his presence is attested at <a href="Partick">Partick</a> near <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. The document in which Walter is mentioned recorded that <a href="William%20Rae%20%28bishop%29">William Rae</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a>, along with his cathedral chapter, agreed to put a dispute to <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a>.

The remainder of his episcopate is not well documented. His only surviving episcopal deed was issued at Abernethy on 8 February 1365. The deed authorised the reduction of canons at Abernethy Collegiate Church from ten to five, adding the consent of the patroness <a href="Margaret%20Stewart%2C%204th%20Countess%20of%20Angus">Margaret, Countess of Angus</a>. These details are also recorded in a papal letter to the Bishop of St Andrews in 1373:Recently a petition of the secular Prior and Chapter [of Abernethy] for confirmation described how the [Collegiate] Church was founded by lay patrons for a prior and five canons. At a later date some of the patrons were eager to augment its rents, and the number of canons was hopefully raised to ten. No such augmentation took place, and because of wars, fires and ruin the Prior and Chapter were brought to straits. Bishop Walter, therefore, with the assent of the patrons and King David, reduced the canons to five. The changes were confirmed by the Pope on 31 October 1375, several years after Bishop Walter's death.

A document of <a href="Inchaffray%20Abbey">Inchaffray Abbey</a>, preserved in the original (as opposed to a later copy), recorded that Bishop Walter had been involved in settling a dispute involving Inchaffray, an abbey which lay in his diocese. Inchaffray's dispute was with Naomhán Mac Eóghainn (Nevin MacEwen) and his wife Mairead (Mariota). Under Abbot Symon de Scone, previous <a href="Abbot%20of%20Inchaffray">Abbot of Inchaffray</a>, the abbey had given some lands in exchange for 40 marks to Mairead's father Maol Mhuire (Malmoran) of <a href="Glencarnie">Glencarnie</a>.

Under the new abbot, Abbot John, the abbey sought the return of those lands. The case appears to have gone to Bishop Walter's <a href="consistorial%20court">consistorial court</a>, which he held at the chapel of <a href="Innerpeffry">Innerpeffry</a>. Here Naomhán and Mairead agreed to accept a payment of 40 marks in exchange for returning the documents of ownership given to them by the abbot and for acknowledging the abbey's ownership. The couple pledged to honour the agreement by swearing an oath on the chapel's <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a>. The case then proceeded to a hearing held under Robert Stewart, <a href="Earl%20of%20Strathearn">Earl of Strathearn</a> and <a href="High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland">High Steward of Scotland</a> (later King Robert II), at <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, where the couple were forced under the threat of severe penalties to swear again never to renew their claim. The decision was sealed by the witnesses, including Bishop Walter, at a Perth church on 30 November 1365.

On 13 March 1366, Walter was commissioned by the papacy to authorise dispensation for the irregular marriage between John Stewart, <a href="Earl%20of%20Carrick">Earl of Carrick</a> (much later <a href="Robert%20III%20of%20Scotland">King Robert III</a>) and Annabella Drummond.

Bishop Walter attended at least five meetings of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Scottish national parliament</a> during his episcopate. He was present at the Scone parliament of 27 September 1367, which discussed royal revenues and relations with the English crown. He was also present at the Scone parliament of June 1368, and the Perth parliament of 6 March 1369; the latter discussed royal business, relations with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Norway">Kingdom of Norway</a>, and law and order in the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a>. <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Robert Stewart</a>, Thomas, Earl of Mar, <a href="Uilleam%20III%2C%20Earl%20of%20Ross">Uilleam III, Earl of Ross</a>, and other Highland lords, were ordered to impose greater control in their regions. Bishop Walter took part in two parliamentary committees, the first a clerical committee devoted to general business, and the second a judicial committee authorised to review earlier legal judgments in the kingdom.

The parliament's discussions on Anglo-Scottish relations preceded peace negotiations later in the year, at which Bishop Walter was one of the Scottish envoys. There was some urgency behind the matter, in view of the impending end to the five-year Anglo-Scottish truce agreed by King <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> on 20 May 1365. King David travelled to London, where he resided in May and June, in order to take part in the negotiations. Walter and the rest of the embassy, which included four other bishops, were in London by June 1369, the month in which Edward agreed to a new truce. When it was ratified by the Scots at <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on 20 July, Bishop Walter was again present, as a witness.

Walter attended the Perth parliament of 18 February 1370, and was named as one of the members of a special committee "for the deliberation concerning the consideration of common justice". He is mentioned for the last time swearing fealty to the new king, Robert II, at his <a href="Enthronement">accession</a> parliament at Scone on 27 March 1371. Walter de Coventre must have died later in 1371 or in very early 1372, because on 27 April 1372, the Pope appointed <a href="Andrew%20Magnus">Andrew Magnus</a> to the vacant bishopric of Dunblane.

HMS Nairana (1917)

HMS "Nairana" () was a passenger ferry that was requisitioned by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> (RN) as a <a href="seaplane%20carrier">seaplane carrier</a> in 1917. She was laid down in Scotland in 1914 as TSS "Nairana" for the Australian shipping line <a href="Huddart%20Parker">Huddart Parker</a>, but construction was suspended after the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. Following resumption of work, the ship was launched in 1915, and converted to operate wheeled aircraft from her forward <a href="flight%20deck">flying-off deck</a>, as well as <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s that were lowered into the water. She saw service during the war with the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and in 1918–19 supported the British <a href="North%20Russia%20Intervention">intervention</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>.

"Nairana" was returned to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, and spent the next 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="Melbourne%2C%20Australia">Melbourne</a>. She was twice struck by <a href="rogue%20wave">rogue wave</a>s in <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>, and nearly <a href="Capsizing">capsized</a> on both occasions. "Nairana" was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">laid up</a> in 1948, wrecked in a storm three years later and <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> "in situ" in 1953–54.

In December 1913, negotiations between the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker and the British shipbuilders <a href="William%20Denny%20and%20Brothers">William Denny and Brothers</a> began for a passenger ship with some cargo capacity to serve in the Australian coastal trade. The shipping line wanted a vessel that would improve on their earlier ferry "Loongana", which had also been built by Denny's. Huddart Parker decided on a design that could carry of cargo on a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of and could maintain for 12 hours. The ship was ordered on 22 January 1914, at a cost of £129,830, for delivery in May 1915. She was named "Nairana" (an <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal Australian</a> name for the "<a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>" or "eagle of the sun").

"Nairana" was designed to accommodate 280 first-class and 112 second-class passengers, and had a crew of 26 officers, 42 crewmen and 25 <a href="stoker%20%28occupation%29">stokers</a>. She had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a draught of . Designed to <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displace</a> "Nairana" had tonnages of , 1,118 long tons DWT, and 3,311 tons <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">Builder's Old Measurement</a>.

The ship was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> 21 June 1915 at the Denny <a href="shipyard">shipyard</a> in <a href="Dumbarton">Dumbarton</a>, Scotland. The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non-military vessels after the start of the First World War, and work had been resumed only to make her <a href="slipway">slipway</a> available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.

HMS "Nairana" displaced in RN service. She was long overall, had a beam of , and a mean draught of . The ship was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="Steam%20turbine%23Marine%20propulsion">steam turbines</a> designed to produce a total of , each driving one three-bladed <a href="propeller">propeller</a>. The turbines were powered by steam provided by six <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s at a working pressure of . On her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, "Nairana" made and reached . She carried of coal which gave her a range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 278, including 90 aviation personnel.

The ship was armed with four 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a>, <a href="QF%2012%20pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun">12-pounder</a> 12 cwt <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing gun</a>s on single mounts. Two of these were mounted on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> as low-angle guns, and the other two were mounted on the rear <a href="hangar">hangar</a> roof as <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a>. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this gave a maximum range of .

"Nairana" was fitted with a flying-off deck forward, intended for aircraft with wheeled <a href="Landing%20gear">undercarriages</a>, and a prominent hangar aft. A massive latticework <a href="gantry%20crane">gantry crane</a> protruded aft from the hangar roof and a twin-boom <a href="derrick">derrick</a> forward were fitted to handle her aircraft. The smaller forward hangar was built under the ship's <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and the aircraft were raised to the flight deck overhead by a <a href="Lift%20%28elevator%29%23Aircraft%20elevators">lift</a>, one of the first in the RN. The forward hangar could fit four single-seat fighters and the rear hangar had a capacity of four <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s. The ship could lower them into the water while steaming at and recover the floatplanes at . She carried of <a href="petrol">petrol</a> for her aircraft.

During her service, "Nairana" carried <a href="Beardmore%20W.B.III">Beardmore W.B.III</a>, <a href="Fairey%20Campania">Fairey Campania</a>, <a href="Short%20Type%20184">Short Type 184</a>, and <a href="Sopwith%20Baby">Sopwith Baby</a>, <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Pup</a>, and <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">2F1 Camel</a> aircraft.

Upon commissioning on 25 August 1917, "Nairana" was assigned to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft. She saw little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and ferrying aircraft to ships equipped with flying-off decks.

In 1918, "Nairana" participated in the <a href="North%20Russia%20Intervention">North Russia Campaign</a> in support of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. On 1 August she took part in what was probably the first fully combined air, sea and land military operation in history, when she and her Campania seaplanes joined <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> ground forces and other ships in driving the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s out of their fortifications on <a href="Modyugski%20Island">Modyugski Island</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Northern%20Dvina%20River">Northern Dvina River</a>. "Nairana" used her own guns on the Bolshevik batteries. She and her aircraft then scouted ahead of the Allied force as it proceeded up the channel to <a href="Arkhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a>. The appearance of one of her Campanias over Arkhangelsk caused the Bolshevik troops there to panic and abandon the city. "Nairana" sustained no damage during the assault. As of October, the ship was carrying five Campanias and two Sopwith Babys, although these last two aircraft were replaced by Sopwith Camels in 1919.

By May 1919, "Nairana" was refitting in <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>. She then ferried a flight of <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>C floatplanes to North Russia for use by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> later in the month. She remained at Murmansk for several weeks before proceeding on to <a href="Kem%2C%20Russia">Kem</a>. There the ship was inspected by <a href="Rear-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Green%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Green</a>, Rear-Admiral Commanding in the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a>, on 29 July. At the end of August, "Nairana" proceeded to <a href="Onega%2C%20Russia">Onega</a> where her aircraft observed for the <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a> as the latter bombarded the town for several days before returning to Kem. She departed Russia on 8 October and arrived back at Rosyth four days later. Later that month the ship was transferred to <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a> to begin the process of <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioning</a> from naval service.

The British Government sold "Nairana" to William Denny and Brothers after her service in Russia to be rebuilt to her original plans, and the ship was handed over to Huddart Parker in January 1921. "Nairana" arrived in Melbourne in March, after a two-month voyage from <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, and commenced her first <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> crossing on 18 April 1921. She was registered in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> under the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British flag</a> and was allocated the United Kingdom official number 143765, and the <a href="code%20letters">code letters</a> THPM. Transferred to <a href="Tasmanian%20Steamers">Tasmanian Steamers</a> in January 1922, she operated the Bass Strait run from <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, <a href="Devonport%2C%20Tasmania">Devonport</a>, and <a href="Burnie%2C%20Tasmania">Burnie</a> to Melbourne for the next 26 years. She accommodated 250 passengers in first class and 140 in second, and generally cruised at . She was withdrawn from service for overhaul at Sydney's <a href="Cockatoo%20Island%20Dockyard">Cockatoo Island Dockyard</a> in October 1922, and again in September–October 1923. In January 1925 "Nairana" was chartered by the Federal Government and crewed by non-union labour, following a strike by shipping workers. She was taken out of service for a major overhaul at Cockatoo Island from May to October 1927. On the night of 24 January 1928, she was struck by a rogue wave in heavy seas, and almost capsized; one woman, already ill when she boarded in Launceston, died.
As well as passengers, "Nairana" regularly carried cargo, including gold bullion, and live animals such as horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a> being transported to <a href="Melbourne%20Zoo">Melbourne Zoo</a> in a wooden crate placed in one of the ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. "Nairana" was withdrawn from service in December 1935 as a result of a ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip Bay</a> on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the <a href="Yarra%20River">Yarra River</a>, having sustained only minor damage.

After <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">war was declared</a> in September 1939, "Nairana" began carrying military personnel as well as commercial passengers. Her hull, previously black, was painted grey, and she was fitted with <a href="Paravane%20%28weapon%29">paravanes</a> to defend against mines, a <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">BL (breech-loading)</a> <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VIII">4-inch Mk VIII</a> anti-submarine gun on the aft <a href="promenade%20deck">promenade deck</a>, and a <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> anti-aircraft gun on her deckhouse. She also carried some <a href=".303%20British">.303 rifles</a> for shooting at mines. As a coal burner that emitted tell-tale black smoke visible for miles, "Nairana" was not considered for war service, the only Bass Strait ferry not to be requisitioned. She thus became the sole commercial passenger vessel to operate between Tasmania and the mainland through the war years, maintaining a heavy schedule. The ship underwent repairs for 13 days at <a href="Williamstown%2C%20Victoria">Williamstown</a>, Victoria, after running aground in the <a href="Tamar%20River">Tamar River</a> in 1943.

"Nairana" had her final overhaul at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured a significant portion of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and "Nairana"s schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. "Nairana" made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, "Nairana" broke her moorings during a <a href="gale">gale</a> on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off <a href="Port%20Melbourne%2C%20Victoria">Port Melbourne</a>. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.

Throughout her career as a Bass Strait ferry, "Nairana" had displayed a commemorative plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier, presented by the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> in recognition of her service in the First World War, and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk. After she was retired, the plaque went on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Wellington%20City%20%26amp%3B%20Sea">Museum of Wellington City & Sea</a>, New Zealand, and the photograph at the <a href="Launceston%20Maritime%20Museum">Launceston Maritime Museum</a>, Tasmania.
