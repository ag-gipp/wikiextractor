Christ Illusion

Christ Illusion is the tenth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, released on August 8, 2006 by <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a>. It was the band's first album to feature original drummer <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a> since "<a href="Seasons%20in%20the%20Abyss">Seasons in the Abyss</a>" (1990), and also marked the first time since "<a href="Divine%20Intervention%20%28album%29">Divine Intervention</a>" (1994) that they recorded songs in D# tuning. The songs "<a href="Jihad%20%28song%29">Jihad</a>", "Flesh Storm", "Catalyst", and "Consfearacy" were recorded in D# tuning, while "Catatonic", "Eyes of the Insane", "Skeleton Christ", and "Supremist" were recorded in Drop B tuning and "Black Serenade" and "Cult" in C# tuning.

Depicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator <a href="Larry%20Carroll%20%28artist%29">Larry Carroll</a>, the album's graphic artwork courted controversy; an alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original, and the band also put out a censored cover without the offensive artwork. Lyrics, particularly in the song "Jihad", describe the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> from the perspective of a terrorist. Following protests, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by <a href="EMI">EMI</a> India.

"Christ Illusion" received generally favorable critical reviews, and entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a> at number 5, making it the band's second highest U.S. chart position as of 2015. The album includes the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>-winning songs "<a href="Eyes%20of%20the%20Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a>" and "Final Six".

"Christ Illusion" was recorded via computer between two studios: NRG Studios, <a href="North%20Hollywood">North Hollywood</a>, with assistant engineer Dave Colvin; and Westlake Studios, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, where Brian Warwick assisted. Guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> recalls nine of the eleven songs originally slated for "Christ Illusion" were demoed in 2004, with <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a> at the drum kit. However, Lombardo recalls recording with King as far back as early 2003, when two demos were completed at Lombardo's home. In a July 2004 interview, guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> reported "Me and Kerry have a bunch of songs," and expressed the band's intent to finish the record that year. Slayer's label <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a> was at the time negotiating a switch of record distributors from <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> to <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>, meaning the recording would have been temporarily shelved until the issue became resolved. For this reason the group did not finish a record at that time, as the distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records was not finalized until late July 2005.

Slayer wished for "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>" producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> to produce the album, and expected him to do so after Rubin expressed an initial interest. Rubin was busy, however, which caused a further delay to recording. While "Christ Illusion"s recording was finally underway Rubin lent production to <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>'s "<a href="Death%20Magnetic">Death Magnetic</a>", an action later described by King as a "slap in the fucking face." <a href="Josh%20Abraham">Josh Abraham</a> produced the album instead, and was praised by <a href="Blabbermouth.net">Blabbermouth</a>'s Don Kaye "for capturing much more of the spark than has been apparent on the last few records." Despite missing an opportunity to produce "Christ Illusion", Rubin contributed in an "<a href="executive%20producer">executive production</a>" capacity. King was critical of his involvement, and said he cannot recall Rubin's presence in the studio during the recording, and that Rubin's main contribution was in providing suggestions during the final mix. Jamie Thomson of UK's "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper was scornful of Rubin's contribution, and observed Slayer "seem unwilling to ditch the nu-metal tendencies that have made much of their recent output so resistible, which suggests Rubin's involvement was considerably less hands-on than in his remarkable redemptions of <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="Neil%20Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>."

As with Slayer's previous two albums, all rhythm guitar tracks on "Christ Illusion" were laid down by King. Using a <a href="Marshall%20Amplification">Marshall</a> JCM 800 as the main guitar sound throughout the album, King wrote roughly 80% of his guitar solo parts prior to the sessions. The song "Catalyst," meanwhile, almost saw inclusion on Slayer's 2001 album "<a href="God%20Hates%20Us%20All">God Hates Us All</a>", existing in an alternative version which features former drummer <a href="Paul%20Bostaph">Paul Bostaph</a> on drums. Lombardo's involvement marked the first time he, King, Araya and Hanneman had appeared together on record since the release of "<a href="Seasons%20in%20the%20Abyss">Seasons in the Abyss</a>" in 1990, a reason cited by guitarist Jeff Hanneman for an alleged clearer <a href="Punk%20rock">punk</a> vibe throughout the songs on the album. Lombardo personally described the album as "a matured "Reign in Blood"", while King described it as "a mix between "God Hates" ["Us All"] and "Seasons" ["in the Abyss"]."

Although eleven songs were originally slated for the album, only ten made the final track listing. A song penned by Hanneman, entitled "Final Six," was meant for inclusion, with the song name originally declared as the album's title by vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> to <a href="George%20Stroumboulopoulos">George Stroumboulopoulos</a> of <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">CBC</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hour%20%28Canadian%20TV%20series%29">The Hour</a>". Questioned about the album's title by <a href="Kevin%20and%20Bean">Kevin and Bean</a> of Los Angeles <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a>, King replied "I'm not positive it's been nailed yet. I think last week was the deadline and I'm not sure where it ended up, so I'm gonna have to take the fifth on that one. The way it was going, my vote was overlooked, so… That's why I'm not real thrilled about it." However, Araya took one weekend off for vacation during the recording of the album and required a two-hour <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> operation the following Monday on May 5, 2006. Thus, he was unable to finish the vocals for the song in time for the album's release. King hinted "Final Six" might appear on a special <a href="digipack">digipack</a> release of "Christ Illusion": a release which eventually surfaced in July 2007. "Final Six" also appeared on the soundtrack to the film "" the following year.

Being Slayer's tenth studio album, "Christ Illusion" was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of the 2000s decade. This connotation with the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>'s <a href="Number%20of%20the%20Beast">Number of the Beast</a> was being used as a marketing ploy to hype a number of media releases at the time, most notably the remake of the horror film "<a href="The%20Omen%20%282006%20film%29">The Omen</a>". King said the idea was scrapped because of the number of other bands that had the same idea, but "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" reported that the release date was thwarted because the band had failed to secure sufficient studio recording time. Having missed the "Satanic" date, the release was pushed back to July 25; however, this date was not met either. Despite this, an exclusive T-shirt, limited to 666 units and only available via the band's store, was released in commemoration of "the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year". Five thousand copies of the limited edition <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> "<a href="Eternal%20Pyre">Eternal Pyre</a>" were also released on this date, and made available via <a href="Hot%20Topic">Hot Topic</a> stores in the US. The EP previewed the song "Cult", and the track was made available for streaming on the band's official website the same day. Issued in Europe on June 23, the EP landed at number 48 on the Swedish charts and number 2 on the Finnish charts, while on June 30, <a href="Nuclear%20Blast%20Records">Nuclear Blast Records</a> released a 7" vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.

Not all media attention surrounding the group on June 6 was favorable. National Day of Slayer, LLC, which describes itself as "a non-profit corporation in the State of Wyoming", requested on their website that Slayer fanatics participate in "The National Day of Slayer" by coming together and listening to the group's tracks. However, vandals attacked St. Joseph's Seminary in <a href="Yonkers">Yonkers</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, by spray-painting a large pentagram in front of the doors, black inverted crosses in two columns in front of the main entrance, and the number six on three steps leading into the Seminary. The words "Reign in Blood" were scrawled on the seminary landing, while the phrase "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven", taken from Book 1 of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s poem "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", was found inscribed on two inside columns. The National Day of Slayer website took credit for inspiring the perpetrator(s), and a media investigation discovered that the site had left instructions that fans "spray paint Slayer logos on churches, synagogues, or cemeteries".

Fans were given an exclusive preview of further tracks culled from the upcoming album before its release. In addition to "Cult", the tracks "Jihad" and "Eyes of the Insane" were made available for streaming on the Spanish website Rafabasa.com in late June. A listening party event for the album took place on July 22 at <a href="Duff%27s%20Brooklyn">Duff's Brooklyn</a> in New York City's <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Brooklyn">Williamsburg</a> neighborhood. Filmed on the set of "<a href="The%20Henry%20Rollins%20Show">The Henry Rollins Show</a>", a live rendition of "Disciple" (taken from Slayer's 2001 album "God Hates Us All") was posted online, followed by "Cult"'s live performance which aired on the "<a href="Independent%20Film%20Channel">Independent Film Channel</a>" a few days later. <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s "Mike Davis Rock Show" gave "Skeleton Christ" a premier airing on August 1, and by August 4 the full album was available for streaming via Slayer's official <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a> profile. AOL Radio complimented this by launching an "All Slayer" station in anticipation of "Christ Illusion"s release, playing all of Slayer's previously released songs and tracks from the upcoming record.

In late July 2006, bus benches in several Californian cities were decorated with promotional artwork for "Christ Illusion". City officials in <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton, California</a>, demanded the artwork be immediately removed from seventeen bus benches located throughout the city, and contacted the hired company which had originally put the adverts in place to assume the task. The officials disliked the band's name, which they felt referred to a murderer. They also took offense to the antichrist and skull logo adorning the bench artwork. Eventually, the artwork was removed. However, various Orange County, California areas surrounding the city of Fullerton still had benches sporting the cover artwork.

"Christ Illusion" was released on August 8, 2006 by American Recordings / Warner Bros. Records. In its first week of release, the album sold 62,000 copies in the United States and debuted at number 5 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart. Though this ranked as the band's highest chart position , and was their first top 10 charting since 1994's "<a href="Divine%20Intervention%20%28album%29">Divine Intervention</a>", the album dropped to number 44 the following week. "Christ Illusion" reached number 9 in Australia, number 3 in Canada, number 6 in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, number 8 in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, number 10 in <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, number 9 in <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and debuted at number 2 in <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and Germany. The single "<a href="Eyes%20of%20the%20Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a>" won the "<a href="Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a>" category at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">49th Grammy Awards</a>. The song "Final Six" also won in the same category at the <a href="50th%20Grammy%20Awards">50th Grammy Awards</a>. The album won the 2006 Metal Storm Award for Best Thrash Metal Album.

The album was met with mostly favorable reviews. On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, it was given a score of 72 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. Thom Jurek of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> hailed the album as "raging, forward-thinking heavy metal melding with hardcore thrash", and wrote that "Christ Illusion" marked a return to "what made them such a breath of fresh air in the first place." Ben Ratliff of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the album as possessing "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: it is the most concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years." <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> critic Adrien Begrand called it "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date", and the album was placed at number 15 on PopMatters' list of "The Best Metal Albums of 2006".
Drummer Lombardo came in for particular praise; though "Rolling Stone" panned the album, the reviewer acknowledged that "at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops." "Blabbermouth"s Don Kaye thought that "while flawed", "Christ Illusion" "proves that the band still has a few tricks up its sleeve and one very potent weapon behind the kit." Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" felt similarly, and reported Lombardo's "performance is top notch throughout and does give the album a looser feel than Paul Bostaph's technical precision offered." In 2011, <a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex Media Network</a>'s music website, <a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>, honored "Christ Illusion" on a List 'Em Carefully installment dedicated to writer David Buchanan's top thirteen metal records released between 2000 and 2010, citing foreign controversy and overall sonic brutality during drummer Dave Lombardo's powerful return. "<a href="Decibel%20Magazine">Decibel Magazine</a>" gave it a favorable review, stating, "Their hatred for religion in general, Christianity in particular, unwitting Americans, and anyone on the other side of a soldier's gun has inspired Slayer to record their most vital album in years." Chris Campion of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" stated that the album is "their most rigorously conceived and focused for years."

Not all critics were positive. Chris Steffen of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine dismissed the album, noting that it "mines much of the same territory as its predecessor, "God Hates Us All", just without the memorable riffs." Jamie Thomson of "The Guardian" described the album as "wholly disappointing," and thought the band sounded "unwilling to ditch the nu-metal tendencies that have made much of their recent output so resistible." "KNAC.com" contributor Peter Atkinson felt that the album "demands OUTRAGE —more calculatingly so than any other album the band has done," and that "that, in a nutshell, is "Christ Illusion"s glaring weakness."

Several aspects of "Christ Illusion"s content and promotion generated adverse attention and publicity. In particular the cover art, painted by <a href="Larry%20Carroll%20%28artist%29">Larry Carroll</a> and depicting a mutilated, stoned Jesus. Carroll, who had painted the cover artwork to previous Slayer albums such as "Reign in Blood", "<a href="South%20of%20Heaven">South of Heaven</a>" and "Seasons in the Abyss", resumed duties on "Christ Illusion". Working solely from track names and formative lyrics, Carroll produced the original on a 4-by-4-foot slab of wood using a combination of media. Having requested an image of Christ in "a sea of despair", King commented that an early version seemed as though Christ was "chilling out in the water". The final image portrays Christ with a missing eye and amputated hands, and standing amidst a sea of blood and severed heads. Araya deemed this version "much better because he looked like a drug addict!", while King admired the artwork enough to purchase the original. Certain album pre-orders gave fans the chance to win one of ten autographed <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a>s of the artwork, while an alternative, non-graphic cover was made to appease retailers who had refused to stock the original version.

"World Entertainment News Network" reported Slayer were attracting controversy through issuing the artwork. Joseph Dias, general secretary of the Mumbai Christian group <a href="Catholic%20Secular%20Forum">Catholic Secular Forum</a>, (CSF) took "strong exception" to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest. Chris Steffen of "Rolling Stone" magazine commented that "The album art takes it all over the top with an image axeman Kerry King dubs 'Christ in a Sea of Despair'", while "KNAC.com"s Peter Atkinson deemed the artwork "defiantly sacrilegious".

Lyrical themes explored on "Christ Illusion" deal with terrorism, warfare and religion, drew criticism from conservative groups. It includes a depiction of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> from the viewpoint of one of the terrorists ("Jihad"), and a portrayal of a soldier's experience of <a href="post-traumatic%20stress">post-traumatic stress</a> ("<a href="Eyes%20of%20the%20Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a>"). The song "Cult" revolves around King's perception of flaws in American religion, while "Consfearacy" has been described as a "government hating song".
Critical reaction to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of "<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>" felt the "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s Chris Steffen mourned that it had become "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," and singled out lyrics such as "Religion's a whore" and "I've made my choice: six six six!" as over the top. Jamie Thomson of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that the album left "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" observed that "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject — war — in surprisingly familiar terms," and remarked that Slayer had sunk "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads <a href="Deicide%20%28band%29">Deicide</a>." He concluded the review with the opinion that "It's déjà vu all over again from "God Hates Us All" — and once you've titled something "God Hates Us All," haven't you made your point enough already?"

The Catholic Secular Forum condemned the album's lyrical content. Joseph Dias issued a statement in which he deemed the lyrics to "Skeleton Christ" to be an "insult to Christianity." The memorandum was sent to Mumbai's police commissioner, and further expressed concern that the track "<a href="Jihad%20%28song%29">Jihad</a>" would offend "the sensibilities of the Muslims... and secular Indians who have respect for all faiths." EMI India met with the "CSF", apologizing for "Christ Illusion"s release and recalling the album with no plans of a reissue. On October 11, 2006 it was announced all stocks had been destroyed. Though Araya had expected "Jihad"'s treatment of the events of 9/11 to create an American backlash, it failed to materialise, in part, he believes, due to peoples' view that the song is merely "just Slayer being Slayer".

North-Eastern Area Command

North-Eastern Area Command was one of several <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based commands</a> raised by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) during World War II. For most of its existence it controlled units based in central and northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. It was formed in January 1942 from the eastern part of the former <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area Command</a>, which had covered all of northern Australia and <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>. Headquartered at <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>, Queensland, North-Eastern Area Command's responsibilities included <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">air defence</a>, <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a> and protection of the <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s within its boundaries. Its flying units, equipped with fighters, reconnaissance bombers, dive bombers and transports, took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">battles of Rabaul</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in 1942, and the <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">landings at Hollandia and Aitape</a> in 1944.

The area command continued to operate after the war, but its assets and staffing were much reduced. Its responsibilities were subsumed in February 1954 by the RAAF's new functional commands: <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a> (operational), <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>. The area headquarters was disbanded in December 1956 and re-formed as <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Headquarters RAAF Townsville</a>.

The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) formed North-Eastern Area Command at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, on 15 January 1942, to take over the eastern portion of what was previously <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area Command</a>. Northern Area had been established on 8 May 1941 as one of the RAAF's <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control zones</a>, covering units in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>, and <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>. The roles of the area commands were <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">air defence</a>, protection of adjacent <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s, and <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a>. Each was led by an <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.

Northern Area was split into <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> (NWA) and North-Eastern Area (NEA) following the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in December 1941, to counter distinct threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea, respectively. Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>, formerly in charge of Northern Area, was NEA's inaugural AOC, taking responsibility for RAAF operations against the Japanese in New Guinea, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and surrounding islands. His headquarters staff numbered 248. On 20 January 1942, over 100 Japanese aircraft <a href="Battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">attacked Rabaul</a>, destroying or badly damaging six <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s and killing or wounding eleven crewmen of <a href="No.%2024%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 24 Squadron</a> under Wing Commander <a href="John%20Lerew">John Lerew</a>. The next day, NEA headquarters sent a signal to Lerew ordering him to keep his airfield open; Lerew, with only two Wirraways left, replied using the legendary ancient <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial phrase to honour an <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a>, "<a href="Ave%20Imperator%2C%20morituri%20te%20salutant">"Morituri vos salutamus"</a>" ("We who are about to die salute you"). Ignoring a further message from headquarters to abandon his squadron and escape in a <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> bomber, Lerew began evacuating staff to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea, on 22 January.
<a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a>, operating ex-<a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> <a href="Short%20Empire">Short Empire</a> flying boats and several smaller transports, was raised in NEA on 19 February 1942. Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> troops at Port Moresby, due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons. On 25 February, Nos. 3 and 4 Fighter Sector Headquarters were established at Townsville and Port Moresby, respectively, to coordinate fighter operations. <a href="Horn%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Horn Island</a>, in the <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a>, was raided by the Japanese on 14 March. Three days later, seventeen <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawks</a> of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a>, recently formed at Townsville, deployed to Port Moresby. Commanded by Squadron Leader <a href="John%20Francis%20Jackson">John Jackson</a>, the squadron suffered heavy losses in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">ensuing battle</a>. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground, securing Port Moresby until relieved by the <a href="35th%20Fighter%20Squadron">35th</a> and <a href="36th%20Fighter%20Squadron">36th Squadrons</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF), operating <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">P-39 Airacobras</a>.

Several USAAF bomber formations operated under NEA's control in early 1942, including <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">A-24 Banshees</a> of the <a href="8th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">8th Squadron</a> from Port Moresby, and <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortresses</a> of the <a href="435th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">435th Squadron</a> (initially known as the "Kangaroo Squadron") from Townsville. As of 20 April, operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was invested in the newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area Command</a> (SWPA). One result of this was the integration of USAAF and RAAF staff at area headquarters. According to the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the RAAF</a>, though "more a diplomatic gesture than a practical method of war organisation", it gave personnel from the two services the opportunity to quickly become acclimatised to each other and "in North-Eastern Area, as an example, the atmosphere was happy and the staff extremely cooperative". Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> in May, USAAF units no longer operated under RAAF control in the NEA but were commanded directly by senior American officers of the AAF; overall responsibility for operational tasking in NEA transferred to the AAF at the end of July.
NEA's operational headquarters, a reinforced concrete <a href="bunker">bunker</a> known as <a href="RAAF%20Operations%20Building%20Site">Building 81</a>, was completed in May 1942. Located on Green Street, Townsville, at the base of <a href="Castle%20Hill%2C%20Queensland">Castle Hill</a>, it was topped with a suburban house to mislead enemy aircraft. The same month, <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area Command</a> was formed, taking control of units in New South Wales and southern Queensland from <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a> and NEA. This left NEA in command of Nos. 24, 33 and <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">76 Squadrons</a>, as well as No. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters, at Townsville; <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a> at <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>; <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 32 Squadron</a> at Horn Island; and <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 11</a>, <a href="No.%2020%20Squadron%20RAAF">20</a> and 75 Squadrons, as well as No. 4 Fighter Sector Headquarters, at Port Moresby. The Japanese raided Townsville four times between 25 and 31 July; most bombs fell in the sea or the hills causing only one casualty, an injured child. NEA's boundaries were finetuned on 19 August: a portion of Queensland within the <a href="Barkly%20Tableland">Barkly Tableland</a> and the Haslingden and Heywood districts was assigned to the control of North-Western Area. Lukis handed over command of NEA to Group Captain (later Air Commodore) <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a> on 25 August. By the end of the month, the headquarters staff numbered 684. No. 75 Squadron, replenished after its defence of Port Moresby, and No. 76 Squadron, deployed north from Townsville and also flying Kittyhawks, played what senior Australian Army commanders described as the "decisive" role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea during August and September 1942. During the battle, Cobby exercised overall command of the RAAF units from NEA headquarters, while their efforts were coordinated on the ground by Group Captain <a href="Bill%20Garing">Bill Garing</a>, NEA's senior air staff officer.

On 1 September 1942, <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 (Operational) Group</a> was formed at Port Moresby as a mobile strike force to move forward with Allied advances in the Pacific, in contrast to the static, defensive nature of the area commands. It took over all units in New Guinea previously operating under NEA Command. NEA initially retained administrative control of No. 9 Group but, on 1 January 1943, the group was made independent of the area command and its administration became the responsibility of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. September 1942 also saw the formation of <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, led by Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA. Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold administrative authority over all Australian units. He personally coordinated operations when they involved more than one area command, for instance when the fighter squadrons of both NWA and NEA were required to repulse a major attack. <a href="No.%2042%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 42 (Radar) Wing</a> was formed at Townsville in February 1943, and the following month took control of all <a href="Radar%20in%20World%20War%20II">radar</a> stations in NEA. As of April 1943, the area command directly controlled four squadrons tasked primarily with <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a>: <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 7 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> reconnaissance-bombers out of <a href="Ross%20River%2C%20Queensland">Ross River</a>; <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 9 Squadron</a>, a fleet co-operation unit flying <a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Supermarine Seagulls</a> from <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a>; and Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalinas</a> from Cairns.
In early 1943, Japan was still believed to be capable of invading, or at least bombing, the Torres Strait islands, and NEA had only No. 7 Squadron, now operating from Horn Island, to counter the threat. It was reinforced in April by <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 84 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a> fighters. The same month, <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a> was formed at Townsville, before deploying to <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a>, New Guinea. Controlling No. 84 Squadron, <a href="No.%2086%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 86 Squadron</a> (flying Kittyhawks), and <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a> (<a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a> dive bombers), the wing was responsible for Torres Strait's air defence, as well as offensive operations against infrastructure and shipping in <a href="Dutch%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a>. In October, No. 84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to the newly formed <a href="No.%2075%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 75 Wing</a>, which was given responsibility for units at Horn Island, <a href="Thursday%20Island">Thursday Island</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Peninsula%20Airport">Higgins Field</a> on <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a>. In February 1944, No. 75 Wing headquarters moved from Horn Island to Higgins Field, where it was soon joined by other units under its control, Nos. 7 and <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">23 Squadrons</a>; the latter operated Vengeances until being declared non-operational in June, before re-equipping with <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberators</a> for duty in North-Western Area. By May, NEA's order of battle on the Australian mainland consisted of Nos. 7, 9, <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAAF">13</a> (operating <a href="Lockheed%20Ventura">Lockheed Ventura</a>s from <a href="Cooktown">Cooktown</a>), 20 and 23 Squadrons. 

Cobby served as AOC NEA until November 1943, handing over to Air Commodore John Summers, who held command for the remainder of the war. By the end of November, NEA headquarters staff numbered 499, including ninety-seven officers. NEA's Catalinas joined aircraft of No. 9 Group in support of the <a href="New%20Britain%20campaign">US invasion of New Britain</a> in December 1943 and January 1944. The Catalinas also conducted mine-laying operations around the <a href="Timor%20Sea">Timor Sea</a> in the lead-up to the <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">landings at Hollandia and Aitape</a> in April 1944. That month, No. 9 Group, which had become a static garrison force similar to the area commands on mainland Australia, was renamed <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a> and given responsibility for RAAF units in New Guinea. In August, No. 75 Wing was disbanded and its units became the direct responsibility of NEA headquarters. The same month, <a href="No.%2076%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 76 Wing</a> headquarters, formed at Townsville in January and subsequently based at Cairns, was transferred to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. There it came under the control of NWA headquarters and oversaw operations by three Catalina squadrons, including No. 20. No. 42 Wing disbanded in October 1944, following a decision to assign control of RAAF radar stations to mobile fighter control units or similar formations. By the end of February 1945, NEA headquarters staff numbered 743, including 127 officers. No. 72 Wing headquarters transferred to Townsville in May that year, and disbanded a month later.

On 2 September 1945, following the end of the Pacific War, South West Pacific Area was dissolved and the RAAF again assumed full control of all its operational elements. By the end of the month, NEA headquarters staff numbered 526, including ninety-eight officers. The Air Force shrank dramatically as personnel were demobilised and units disbanded; most of the RAAF's bases and aircraft employed in operations after the war were situated within Eastern Area's sphere of control in New South Wales and southern Queensland. NEA headquarters staff at the end of 1945 totalled 227, including sixty-three officers.

In September 1946, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, proposed reducing the five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Areas</a>) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place. Northern Command (redesignated Northern Area in 1945) was dissolved in February 1947. By 1949, NEA headquarters was <a href="Commonwealth%20Offices%2C%20Townsville">located in Sturt Street</a>, Townsville. <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a> was based at Townsville from March that year, operating <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>s over the Pacific and Australia's northern approaches in the maritime reconnaissance and search-and-rescue roles. Group Captain (later Air Commodore) <a href="Ian%20Dougald%20McLachlan">Ian McLachlan</a> was appointed AOC NEA in September 1951; he served two years in the post before handing over to acting Air Commodore Patrick Heffernan.

Commencing in October 1953, the RAAF was reorganised from a geographically based command-and-control system into one based on function. In February 1954, the newly constituted functional organisations—<a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>—assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from North-Eastern Area Command. NEA headquarters remained in existence but only, according to the Melbourne "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Melbourne%29">Argus</a>", as one of Home Command's "remote control points". It was disbanded on 3 December 1956, and was succeeded by <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Headquarters RAAF Townsville</a> (<a href="Tactical%20Transport%20Group%20RAAF">Headquarters Tactical Transport Group</a> from June 1988, and <a href="Combat%20Support%20Group%20RAAF">Headquarters Operational Support Group</a> from February 1991).

As of 2009, the former NEA operational headquarters in Building 81, Green Street, housed Townsville's <a href="Queensland%20State%20Emergency%20Service">State Emergency Service</a> group.

As at 30 April 1942, NEA's <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a> comprised:

Matthew Brettingham

Matthew Brettingham (1699 – 19 August 1769), sometimes called Matthew Brettingham the Elder, was an 18th-century <a href="England">Englishman</a> who rose from humble origins to supervise the construction of <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a>, and become one of the country's best-known <a href="architect">architect</a>s of his generation. Much of his principal work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a>. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> area of <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a>. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began to fall out of fashion and <a href="neoclassicism">neoclassicism</a> was introduced, championed by the young <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a>.

Brettingham was born in 1699, the second son of Launcelot Brettingham (1664–1727), a <a href="bricklayer">bricklayer</a> or stonemason from <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England. He married Martha Bunn (c. 1697–1783) at <a href="St.%20Augustine%27s%20Church%2C%20Norwich">St. Augustine's Church, Norwich</a>, on 17 May 1721 and they had nine children together.

His early life is little documented, and one of the earliest recorded references to him is in 1719, when he and his elder brother Robert were admitted to the city of Norwich as <a href="wikt%3Afreeman">freemen</a> bricklayers. A critic of Brettingham's at this time claimed that his work was so poor that it was not worth the nine <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s a week (£ in 2019) he was paid as a <a href="artisan">craftsman</a> bricklayer. Whatever the quality of his bricklaying, he soon advanced himself and became a building <a href="independent%20contractor">contractor</a>.

During the early eighteenth century, a building contractor had far more responsibilities than the title suggests today. A contractor often designed, built, and oversaw all details of construction to completion. Architects, often called <a href="Surveyor%20%28surveying%29">surveyors</a>, were employed only for the grandest and largest of buildings. By 1730, Brettingham is referred to as a surveyor, working on more important structures than <a href="cottage">cottage</a>s and agricultural buildings. In 1731, it is recorded that he was paid £112 (£ in 2019) for his work on Norwich Gaol. From then, he appears to have worked regularly as the surveyor to the Justices (the contemporary local authority) on public buildings and <a href="bridge">bridge</a>s throughout the 1740s. Projects of his dating from this time include the remodelling of the Shirehouse in Norwich, the construction of <a href="Lenwade">Lenwade</a> Bridge over the <a href="river%20Wensum">river Wensum</a>, repairs to <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a> and <a href="Norwich%20Cathedral">Norwich Cathedral</a>, as well as the rebuilding of much of <a href="King%27s%20Lynn%20Minster">St. Margaret's Church, King's Lynn</a>, which had been severely damaged by the collapse of its spire in 1742. His work on the Shirehouse, which was in the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">gothic</a> style and showed a versatility of design rare for Brettingham, was to result in a protracted court case that was to rumble on through a large part of his life, with allegations of financial discrepancies. In 1755, the case was eventually closed, and Brettingham was left several hundred <a href="Pound%20Sterling">pounds</a> out of pocket—several tens of thousands, in present-day terms—and with a stain—if only a local one—on his character. Transcripts of the case suggest that it was Brettingham's brother Robert, to whom he had subcontracted and who was responsible for the flint stonework of the Shirehouse, who may have been the cause of the allegations. Brettingham's brief flirtation with the Gothic style, in the words of Robin Lucas, indicates "the approach of an engineer rather than an antiquary" and is "now seen as outlandish". The Shirehouse was demolished in 1822.

In 1734, Brettingham had his first great opportunity, when two of the foremost Palladian architects of the day, <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a> and <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Lord Burlington</a>, were collaboratively designing a grandiose Palladian country <a href="palace">palace</a> at <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a> in Norfolk for <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester%20%28fifth%20creation%29">Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester</a>. Brettingham was appointed <a href="Clerk%20of%20Works">Clerk of Works</a> (sometimes referred to as executive architect), at an annual salary of £50 (£ per year in 2019). He retained the position until the Earl's death in 1759. The illustrious architects were mostly absent; indeed Burlington was more of an <a href="idealist">idealist</a> than an architect, thus Brettingham and the patron Lord Leicester were left to work on the project together, with the practical Brettingham interpreting the architects' plans to Leicester's requirements. It was at Holkham that Brettingham first worked with the fashionable Palladian style, which was to be his trademark. Holkham was to be Brettingham's springboard to fame, as it was through his association with it that he came to the attention of other local <a href="patron">patron</a>s, and further work at Heydon and <a href="Honingham%20Hall">Honingham Hall</a> established Brettingham as a local country-house architect.

Brettingham was commissioned in 1742 to redesign <a href="Langley%20Hall">Langley Hall</a>, a <a href="mansion">mansion</a> standing in its own <a href="park">park</a>land in South Norfolk. His design was very much in the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner <a href="tower">tower</a>s, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at <a href="Euston%20Hall">Euston Hall</a>, were the work of a later owner and architect. The <a href="neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir <a href="John%20Soane">John Soane</a>. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of <a href="Hanworth%20Hall">Hanworth Hall</a>, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay <a href="facade">facade</a> of <a href="brick">brick</a> with the centre three bays projected with a <a href="pediment">pediment</a>.

In 1745, Brettingham designed <a href="Gunton%20Hall">Gunton Hall</a> in Norfolk for Sir <a href="Baron%20Suffield">William Harbord</a>, three years after the former house on the site was gutted by fire. The new house of brick had a principal facade like that of Hanworth Hall, however, this larger house was seven bays deep, and had a large service wing on its western side. His commissions began to come from further afield: <a href="Goodwood%20House">Goodwood</a> in Sussex and Marble Hill, <a href="Twickenham">Twickenham</a>.

In 1750, now well-known, the architect received an important commission to remodel <a href="Euston%20Hall">Euston Hall</a> in East Anglia, the Suffolk country seat of the influential <a href="Charles%20FitzRoy%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Grafton">2nd Duke of Grafton</a>. The original house, built circa 1666 in the <a href="France">French</a> style, was built around a central <a href="courtyard">court</a> with large <a href="pavilions">pavilions</a> at each corner. While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the <a href="window">fenestration</a> and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>'s at <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a>). The pavilions' <a href="dome">dome</a>s were replaced by low <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a> roofs similar to those at Holkham. Brettingham also created the large service courtyard at Euston that now acts as the entrance court to the mansion, which today is only a fraction of its former size.

The Euston commission seems to have brought Brettingham firmly to the notice of other wealthy patrons. In 1751, he began work for the <a href="Charles%20Wyndham%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Egremont">Earl of Egremont</a> at <a href="Petworth%20House">Petworth House</a>, Sussex. He continued work intermittently at Petworth for the next twelve years, including designing a new picture gallery from 1754. Over the same period his country-house work included alterations at <a href="Moor%20Park%2C%20Hertfordshire">Moor Park, Hertfordshire</a>; <a href="Wortley%20Hall">Wortley Hall</a>, Yorkshire; Wakefield Lodge, Northamptonshire; and Benacre House, Suffolk.

From 1747, Brettingham operated from <a href="London">London</a> as well as Norwich. This period marks a turning point in his career, as he was now no longer designing country houses and farm buildings just for the local aristocrats and the Norfolk <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, but for the greater aristocracy based in London.

One of Brettingham's greatest solo commissions came when he was asked to design a town house for the <a href="Edward%20Howard%2C%209th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">9th Duke of Norfolk</a> in <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Square">St. James's Square</a>, London. Completed in 1756, the exterior of this mansion was similar to those of many of the great "palazzi" in Italian cities: bland and featureless, the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a> distinguishable only by its tall pedimented windows. This arrangement, devoid of <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and a pediment giving prominence to the central bays at roof height, was initially too severe for the English taste, even by the fashionable Palladian standards of the day. Early critics declared the design "insipid".

However, the interior design of <a href="Norfolk%20House">Norfolk House</a> was to define the London town house for the next century. The floor plan was based on an adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a>. A circuit of reception rooms centred on a grand staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received at the head of the staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each room had access to the next, it also had access to the central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses had had to reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what <a href="Andrea%20Palladio">Andrea Palladio</a> had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large "palazzo" in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the <a href="prototype">prototype</a> for many London mansions over the next few decades.

Brettingham's additional work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the <a href="William%20Wentworth%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Strafford%20%281722-1791%29">2nd Earl of Strafford</a> and No. 13 for the <a href="Henry%20Liddell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ravensworth">1st Lord Ravensworth</a>. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham was working in the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, is one of the few great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as <a href="Cambridge%20House">Cambridge House</a> and was the home of <a href="Henry%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, and then of the <a href="Naval%20%26amp%3B%20Military%20Club">Naval & Military Club</a>; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.
<a href="Viscount%20Scarsdale%23Barons%20Scarsdale%20%281761%29">Sir Nathaniel Curzon, later 1st Baron Scarsdale</a>, commissioned Brettingham in 1759 to design a great country house. Thirty years before a prospective design for a new Kedleston Hall had been drawn up by <a href="James%20Gibbs">James Gibbs</a>, one of the leading architects of the day, but Curzon wanted his new house to match the style and taste of Holkham. Lord Leicester, Holkham's owner and Brettingham's employer, was a particular hero of Curzon's. Curzon was a <a href="Tory">Tory</a> from a very old Derbyshire family, and he wished to create a showpiece to rival the nearby <a href="Chatsworth%20House">Chatsworth House</a> owned by the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> <a href="Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Duke of Devonshire</a>, whose family were relative newcomers in the county, having arrived little more than two hundred years earlier. However, the Duke of Devonshire's influence, wealth, and title were far superior to Curzon's, and Curzon was unable to complete his house or to match the Devonshires' influence (<a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire</a>, had been Prime Minister in the 1750s). This commission might have been the ultimate accolade Brettingham was seeking, to recreate Holkham but this time with full credit. <a href="Kedleston%20Hall">Kedleston Hall</a> was designed by Brettingham on a plan by Palladio for the unbuilt Villa Mocenigo. The design by Brettingham, similar to that of Holkham Hall, was for a massive principal central block flanked by four secondary wings, each a miniature <a href="country%20house">country house</a>, themselves linked by <a href="Quadrant%20%28architecture%29">quadrant</a> corridors. From the outset of the project, Curzon seems to have presented Brettingham with rivals. In 1759, while Brettingham was still supervising the construction of the initial phase, the northeast family block, Curzon employed architect <a href="James%20Paine%20%28architect%29">James Paine</a>, the most notable architect of the day, to supervise the kitchen block and quadrants. Paine also went on to supervise the construction of Brettingham's great north front. However, this was a critical moment for architecture in England. Palladianism was being challenged by a new taste for neoclassical designs, one exponent of which was <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a>. Curzon had met Adam as early as 1758, and had been impressed by the young architect newly returned from Rome. He employed Adam to design some garden <a href="pavilions">pavilions</a> for the new Kedleston. So impressed was Curzon by Adam's work that by April 1760 he had put Adam in sole charge of the design of the new mansion, replacing both Brettingham and Paine. Adam completed the north facade of the mansion much as Brettingham had designed it, only altering Brettingham's intended portico. The basic layout of the house remained loyal to Brettingham's original plan, although only two of the proposed four secondary wings were executed.

Brettingham moved on to other projects. In the 1760s, he was approached by his most illustrious patron, the <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany">Duke of York</a> (brother of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>), to design one of the greatest mansions in <a href="Pall%20Mall%2C%20London">Pall Mall</a>, namely <a href="York%20House%2C%20Pall%20Mall">York House</a>. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.

Its royal occupant may very well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was one of his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at <a href="Packington%20Hall">Packington Hall</a>, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted <a href="peerage">peers</a> and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary <a href="Giacomo%20Leoni">Giacomo Leoni</a> he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace <a href="James%20Paine%20%28architect%29">James Paine</a> as architect at <a href="Nostell%20Priory">Nostell Priory</a>, <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>, and <a href="Syon%20House">Syon House</a>. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.

Brettingham's principal contribution to architecture is perhaps the design of the grand town house, unremarkable for its exterior but with a circulating plan for reception rooms suitable for entertaining within on a forgotten scale of lavishness. Many of these anachronistic palaces are now long demolished or have been transformed for other uses and are inaccessible for public viewing. Hence, what little remains in London of his work is unknown to the general public. Of Brettingham's work, only the buildings he remodelled have survived, and for this reason Brettingham now tends to be thought of as an "improver" rather than an architect of country houses.

There is no evidence that Brettingham ever formally studied architecture or travelled abroad. Reports of him making two trips to Continental Europe, are the result of confusion with his son, Matthew Brettingham the Younger. That he enjoyed success in his own lifetime is beyond doubt—Robert Adam calculated that when Brettingham sent his son, Matthew, on the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> (1747), he went with a sum of money in his pocket of around £15,000 (£ in 2019), an enormous amount at the time. However, part of this sum was probably used to acquire the statuary in Italy (documented as supplied by Matthew Brettingham the Younger) for the nearly completed Holkham Hall. Matthew Brettingham the Younger wrote that his father "considered the building of Holkham as the great work of his life". While the design of that great monumental house, which still stands, cannot truly be accredited to him, it is the building for which Brettingham is best remembered.

Michigan State Capitol

The Michigan State Capitol is the building that houses the legislative branch of the government of the U.S. state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. It is in the portion of the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20capitals">state capital</a> of <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> which lies in <a href="Ingham%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ingham County</a>. The present structure, at the intersection of Capitol and Michigan Avenues, is a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> that houses the chambers and offices of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> as well as the ceremonial offices of the <a href="Governor%20of%20Michigan">Governor of Michigan</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Michigan">Lieutenant Governor</a>. Historically, this is the third building to house the Michigan government.

The first state capitol was in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, the original capital of Michigan, and was relocated to Lansing in 1847, due to the need to develop the state's western portion and for better defense from <a href="British%20Army">British troops</a> stationed in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor, Ontario</a>.

On July 13, 1787, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> passed the <a href="Northwest%20Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a>, creating the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a> which included Michigan. In 1805, the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Congress</a> created the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a>, with Detroit as its territorial capital. Michigan first applied for <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20date%20of%20statehood">statehood</a> as early as 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> over the <a href="Toledo%20Strip">Toledo Strip</a>, a 468-square mile (1,210 km²) area that included the important port city of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The state's boundaries included the contested area.
The dispute culminated in what has become known as the <a href="Toledo%20War">Toledo War</a>, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a condition for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern three-quarters of the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> as its first capital.

The first building to serve as the State Capitol was built in 1832 as the "Territorial Courthouse". The court house was on the corner of Griswold Street and State Street. This brick structure was one of Michigan's earliest <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek revival</a> buildings, with a <a href="portico">portico</a> of <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> <a href="Classical%20order">columns</a> and a central tower of 140 feet (42 m). Built at a cost of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>24,500 ($ in 2019), the building housed the territorial government and state legislatures until 1848, when a hastily erected wood building was constructed in <a href="Lansing">Lansing</a> following a decision made March 17, 1847, to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing. The Detroit building then became a <a href="Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29">public school</a> (the Union School, at one time the city's only <a href="high%20school">high school</a>) and library until it burned in 1893.

The 1835 <a href="Michigan%20Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> provided that:
Prior to 1847, Detroit fought to maintain the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing western part of the state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–US border</a>. Detroit had been occupied during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Windsor, Ontario</a>, at the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a> continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.

Contenders seeking designation as the new Capitol included <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson</a>, <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>, and <a href="Shiawassee%20Township">Shiawassee Township</a> in <a href="Shiawassee%20County">Shiawassee County</a>. At one point during the debate, <a href="Marshall%2C%20Michigan">Marshall</a> officials were so certain of its selection that they built a governor's mansion. After extensive debate, State Senator <a href="Joseph%20H.%20Kilbourne">Joseph H. Kilbourne</a> of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government. The legislature agreed, with the location north of Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, and east of Grand Rapids being deemed a suitable compromise. The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.

Construction began in 1847 on the state capitol building in Lansing, a temporary structure on the block bordered by Washington Avenue, Capitol Avenue, Allegan Street, and Washtenaw Street. It was a simple two-story wood frame structure, painted white with green wooden <a href="Window%20shutter">shutters</a> and topped by a tin <a href="cupola">cupola</a>. The total cost for construction was $22,952.01 ($ in 2019). The building was sold when the permanent capitol building opened in 1879. It was then used as a factory until, like the first capitol, it was destroyed by a fire in 1882.

In the early 1870s, Governor <a href="Henry%20P.%20Baldwin">Henry P. Baldwin</a> urged the legislature to fund a new, permanent capitol. On March 31, 1871, a bill was adopted "for the erection of a new state capitol, and a building for the temporary use of the state officers." The new capitol was to cost $1.2 million ($ in 2019), to be raised by a six-year state <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>.

In 1872, architect <a href="Elijah%20E.%20Myers">Elijah E. Myers</a> of <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, was commissioned to design the new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named "Tuebor", which means "I will defend". Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of <a href="Colorado%20State%20Capitol">Colorado</a> and <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">Texas</a>, as well as the former territorial capitol building of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, the most by any architect. The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated at the same time as the inauguration of Governor <a href="Charles%20Croswell">Charles Croswell</a> January 1, 1879.

The Lansing capitol building inspired a national trend after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> for <a href="Firewall%20%28construction%29">fireproof</a> buildings, large enough to house expanding government as well as serving as a durable repository for artifacts of the war, including <a href="war%20flag">battle flags</a> that were moved to the Michigan Historical Museum in 1990. Over the years the dome, which at first matched the light tan of the building, was repainted a bright white. The legislature funded an extensive historical restoration starting in 1989 which was completed in 1992. The restoration returned the dome to a creamy-white shade, upgraded mechanical systems, and improved accessibility as well as restoring many of the original design elements. One of the restoration's largest phases entailed removal of "half-floors" that were installed in 1969 to create of additional office space. The floors were created by dividing the -high rooms horizontally and creating a level of rooms which was accessed from the stairway landing. The Capitol Building was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> January 25, 1971 (NRHP Reference #71000396), and was designated as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> October 5, 1992.

The Michigan State Capitol is from the ground to the tip of finial/spire above the dome. The building is long and wide (including approaches). The capitol occupies , has a perimeter of . The structure contains four stories, with public entrances on the ground floor. Two grand staircases in the north and south corridors go up to the top floor. The rotunda measures in diameter and in height measured from the floor to the <a href="oculus">oculus</a>.

When it opened, the Capitol structure was large enough to host all the state agencies and departments. Due to the growth of state government, however, only the offices of Senate and House leadership and ceremonial offices for the governor and lieutenant governor remain in the capitol. The ground floor corridors led to "store rooms" designed by the architect in the original building plans. This includes an armory in the southwest corner of the south corridor. The original wood floor has been replaced by gray tiles. The rooms were originally lit with gas fixtures, though by 1900, the building had been refitted with electric lights. Today, the ground floor is home to several offices, including the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, and the Capitol Tours and Information Service.

Starting with the first floor and continuing to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> marble and limestone. The exception is the floor of the rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass. The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above. The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and hinges, locked for protection, display the state <a href="Seal%20of%20Michigan">coat of arms</a>. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.
The first floor gives visitors their first view of the interior of the <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a>. Below the <a href="cast%20iron">cast-iron</a> dome, the ceiling displays eight <a href="muse">muse</a>s painted in 1886. For more than a century, the muses' artist remained anonymous; it is now known that it was <a href="Tommaso%20Juglaris">Tommaso Juglaris</a>, who created them in his <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a> studio and never came to Michigan. In the east wing of the first floor is a large clock, called a long-drop clock. It was once the building's <a href="master%20clock">master clock</a> and is at least as old as the Capitol. The clock was restored in 1990 and is in working condition.

The second floor, in addition to housing the gubernatorial offices, features the Gallery of Governors with portraits of former Michigan Governors on the walls of the rotunda; the gallery extends up to the third floor. The governor's offices were among the most extensively restored during the 1989–1992 restoration. The office features a suite of original furnishings manufactured in 1876 by the Feige Brothers Company of <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>. The former chambers of the Michigan Supreme Court are in the south wing of the building. The court vacated its chambers in 1970 for larger quarters, eventually moving to its current location in the <a href="Michigan%20Hall%20of%20Justice">Michigan Hall of Justice</a>. The room is now used by the Senate Appropriations Committee and named for longtime chairman <a href="Harry%20Gast">Harry Gast</a>.

Public access to Michigan's legislative bodies is through the third floor. The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the <a href="bicameralism">bicameral</a> <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">state legislature</a>, which is composed of the <a href="Michigan%20House%20of%20Representatives">Michigan House of Representatives</a> and <a href="Michigan%20Senate">Michigan Senate</a>. Public galleries are at both ends of the third floor. The Senate, with 38 members, has its chambers on the south side of the building, while the House of Representatives, with 110 members, has its chambers in the north wing. House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:30 AM, while Senate sessions begin at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays. Senate and House sessions are taped by <a href="Michigan%20Government%20Television">Michigan Government Television</a>, a public service body transmitted to local <a href="cable%20television">cable television</a> systems' <a href="government-access%20television">government-access television</a> channels. Similar to <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a>, MGTV has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15, 1996.

Although having the same floor plan, the House and Senate chambers are decorated very differently, with the former in <a href="terra%20cotta">terra cotta</a> and <a href="Teal%20%28color%29">teal</a> colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a> in the carpet at the entrance to the House chamber features the <a href="List%20of%20state%20flowers">state flower</a>, the <a href="apple%23Pollination">apple blossom</a>. Presiding over the house is the <a href="speaker%20of%20the%20house">speaker</a>, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the <a href="Seal%20of%20Michigan">state coat of arms</a>. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The <a href="president%20of%20the%20Senate">president of the Senate</a> is the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Michigan">lieutenant governor</a>, who presides over sessions from a <a href="walnut">walnut</a> <a href="Lectern">rostrum</a> at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.

In summer 2013, the structure underwent additional work to replace carpeting installed in the 1989–1992 renovation that had become worn and frayed in many areas. Work also upgraded wiring for communications systems, repaired roof leaks and upgraded a handicapped parking area and entrance on the north side.

The Capitol Pediment, located above the main front entrance to the building, is entitled "The Rise and Progress of Michigan." It depicts a central figure, Michigan, who is dressed as a Native American. She offers a book and globe to the people of her state, promising a bright future. She is surrounded by symbols of Michigan's economy, including a plow, <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a>, and a laurel wreath to represent agriculture. Also included are symbols representing shipping, mining, and lumbering.

The cornerstone, located at the northeast corner of the building, bears the dates "1872", the start of construction, and "1878", the year of completion. The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture, although several coins from the era remained intact. Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, and lifestyles. At the lawn's southeast corner is the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a> Memorial, a 1924-bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>.

The grounds have several notable trees. An <a href="Eastern%20White%20Pine">Eastern White Pine</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees">state tree</a> of Michigan, is located at the east front of the building. The Dr. <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> Tree was planted in memory of the slain leader in 1984 to the north of the <a href="Austin%20Blair">Austin Blair</a> Monument. The oldest tree on the grounds is a <a href="catalpa">catalpa</a> on the southeast lawn present when the Capitol was dedicated in 1873. The <a href="American%20Forestry%20Association">American Forestry Association</a> has certified this catalpa is the largest living tree of its kind in the United States. The most recently dedicated tree is a blue spruce called "the Freedom Tree," planted in 1973 as a memorial to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>'s <a href="missing-in-action">missing-in-action</a> and <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>.

Holkham Hall

Holkham Hall ( or ) is an 18th-century <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a> located adjacent to the village of <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England. The house was constructed in the <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> style for <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester%20%28fifth%20creation%29">The 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)</a> by the architect <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a>, aided by the architect and aristocrat <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Lord Burlington</a>.

Holkham Hall is one of England's finest examples of the Palladian revival style of architecture, and the severity of its design is closer to Palladio's ideals than many of the other numerous Palladian style houses of the period. The Holkham Estate was built up by <a href="Sir%20Edward%20Coke">Sir Edward Coke</a>, the founder of his family fortune. He bought Neales manor in 1609, though never lived there, and many other purchases of land in Norfolk to endow to his six sons. His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home and by 1659 John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors. It is the ancestral home of the Coke family, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earls of Leicester of Holkham</a>.

The interior of the hall is opulently, but by the standards of the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>, or the first floor, and <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.

Holkham was built by 1st <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a>, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both <a href="Richard%20Boyle%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Burlington">Burlington</a>—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of <a href="cockfighting">cockfighting</a>. He made a disastrous investment in the <a href="South%20Sea%20Company">South Sea Company</a> and when the South Sea <a href="Economic%20bubble">Bubble</a> burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.

Although <a href="Colen%20Campbell">Colen Campbell</a> was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by <a href="Matthew%20Brettingham">Matthew Brettingham</a>, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, when it was introduced by <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>. However, following the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> it was replaced in popular favour by the <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> style. The "Palladian revival", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect <a href="Andrea%20Palladio">Andrea Palladio</a>. However it did not adhere to Palladio's strict rules of proportion. The style eventually evolved into what is generally referred to as <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a>, still popular in England today. It was the chosen style for numerous houses in both town and country, although Holkham is exceptional for both its severity of design and for being closer than most in its adherence to Palladio's ideals.

Although Thomas Coke oversaw the project, he delegated the on-site architectural duties to the local Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>50 a year (about pounds per year in 2019 terms) in return for "taking care of his Lordship's buildings". He was also influential in the design of the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as "the great work of [my life]", and when he published his "The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement. However, in a later edition of the book, Brettingham's son admitted that "the general idea was first struck out by the Earls of Leicester and Burlington, assisted by Mr. William Kent".

In 1734, the first foundations were laid; however, building was to continue for thirty years, until the completion of the great house in 1764.

The Palladian style was admired by <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a> such as Thomas Coke, who sought to identify themselves with the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> of antiquity. Kent was responsible for the external appearance of Holkham; he based his design on Palladio's unbuilt Villa Mocenigo, as it appears in "<a href="I%20Quattro%20Libri%20dell%27Architettura">I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura</a>", but with modifications.

The plans for Holkham were of a large central block of two floors only, containing on the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a> level a series of symmetrically balanced <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s situated around two <a href="courtyard">courtyard</a>s. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners is linked to the main house not by long <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>s—as would have been the norm in Palladian architecture—but by short two-storey wings of only one bay.

The external appearance of Holkham can best be described as a huge <a href="Roman%20architecture">Roman</a> <a href="palace">palace</a>. However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the external appearance is austere and devoid of <a href="ornament%20%28architecture%29">ornamentation</a>. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded "commodiousness", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a <a href="mezzanine%20%28architecture%29">mezzanine</a> would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the <a href="facade">facade</a>. On the ground floor, the <a href="rustication%20%28architecture%29">rusticated</a> walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, <a href="Nigel%20Nicolson">Nigel Nicolson</a>, has described the house as appearing as functional as a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n riding school.

The principal, or South façade, is 344 feet (104.9 m) in length (from each of the flanking wings to the other), its austerity relieved on the piano nobile level only by a great six-<a href="column">column</a>ed <a href="portico">portico</a>. Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a <a href="Venetian%20window">Venetian window</a> surmounted by a single storey square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> at <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a> nearly a century earlier. A near identical portico was designed by Inigo Jones and <a href="Isaac%20de%20Caus">Isaac de Caus</a> for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.

The flanking wings contain service and secondary rooms—the family wing to the south-west; the guest wing to the north-west; the chapel wing to the south-east; and the kitchen wing to the north-east. Each wing's external appearance is identical: three bays, each separated from the other by a narrow recess in the elevation. Each bay is surmounted by an unadorned <a href="pediment">pediment</a>. The composition of stone, recesses, varying pediments and chimneys of the four blocks is almost reminiscent of the <a href="English%20Baroque">English Baroque</a> style in favour ten years earlier, employed at <a href="Seaton%20Delaval%20Hall">Seaton Delaval Hall</a> by Sir <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>. One of these wings, as at the later <a href="Kedleston%20Hall">Kedleston Hall</a>, was a self-contained country house to accommodate the family when the state rooms and central block were not in use.

The one storey porch at the main north entrance was designed in the 1850s by <a href="Samuel%20Sanders%20Teulon">Samuel Sanders Teulon</a>, although stylistically it is indistinguishable from the 18th-century building.

Inside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England. It has, in fact, been described as "The finest Palladian interior in England." The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for "the eloquence of a plain surface". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster <a href="reredos">reredos</a>. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a>), modelled by Kent on a Roman <a href="basilica">basilica</a>. The room is over 50 feet (15 m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a>: here alabaster <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic columns</a> support the <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed, <a href="gilding">gilded</a> ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the <a href="Temple%20of%20Fortuna%20Virilis">Temple of Fortuna Virilis</a>, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.

The hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed, gilded ceiling. In this room hangs <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>'s "Return from Egypt". On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs the full length of the house north to south. The North Dining Room, a cube room of 27 feet (8.2 m) contains an <a href="Axminster">Axminster</a> carpet that perfectly mirrors the pattern of the ceiling above. A bust of <a href="Aelius%20Verus">Aelius Verus</a>, set in a <a href="niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a> in the wall of this room, was found during the restoration at <a href="Nettuno">Nettuno</a>. A classical <a href="apse">apse</a> gives the room an almost temple air. The apse in fact, contains concealed access to the labyrinth of corridors and narrow stairs that lead to the distant kitchens and service areas of the house. Each corner of the east side of the principal block contains a square salon lit by a huge Venetian window, one of them—the Landscape Room—hung with paintings by <a href="Claude%20Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</a> and <a href="Gaspar%20Poussin">Gaspar Poussin</a>. All of the major state rooms have symmetrical walls, even where this involves matching real with false doors. The major rooms also have elaborate white and multi-coloured marble fireplaces, most with carvings and sculpture, mainly the work of Thomas Carter, though Joseph Pickford carved the fireplace in the Statue Gallery. Much of the furniture in the state rooms was also designed by William Kent, in a stately classicising baroque manner.

So restrained is the interior decoration of the state rooms, or in the words of <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a>, "chaste", that the smaller, more intimate rooms in the family's private south-west wing were decorated in similar vein, without being overpowering. The long library running the full length of the wing still contains the collection of books acquired by Thomas Coke on his Grand Tour through Italy, where he saw for the first time the Palladian villas which were to inspire Holkham.

The Green State bedroom is the principal bedroom; it is decorated with paintings and tapestries, including works by <a href="Paul%20Saunders">Paul Saunders</a> and George Smith Bradshaw. It is said that when <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> visited, <a href="Gavin%20Hamilton%20%28artist%29">Gavin Hamilton</a>'s "lewd" depiction of "Jupiter Caressing Juno" "was considered unsuitable for that lady's eyes and was banished to the attics".

Work to the designs of William Kent on the park commenced in 1729, several years before the house was constructed. This event was commemorated by the construction in 1730 of the <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>, in height, standing on the highest point in the park. It is located over half a mile to the south and on <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">axis</a> with the centre of the house. An avenue of trees stretches over a mile south of the obelisk. Thousands of trees were planted on what had been windswept land; by 1770 the park covered . Other garden buildings designed by Kent are, near the far end of the avenue the Triumphal Arch, designed in 1739 but only completed in 1752 and the domed <a href="Doric%20order">doric</a> temple (1730–35) in the woods near the obelisk. Above the main entrance to the house within the Marble Hall is this inscription:
THIS SEAT, on an open barren Estate 
Was planned, planted, built, decorated.
And inhabited the middle of the XVIIIth Century 
By THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER
Under <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester%20%28seventh%20creation%29">Coke of Norfolk</a>, the great-nephew and heir of the builder, extensive improvements were made to the park and by his death in 1842 it had grown to its present extent of over . As well as planting over a million trees on the estate Coke employed the architect <a href="Samuel%20Wyatt">Samuel Wyatt</a> to design over a number of buildings, including a series of farm buildings and farmhouses in a simplified neo-classical style and, in the 1780s, the new walled <a href="kitchen%20garden">kitchen garden</a>s covering . The gardens stand to the west of the lake and include: A fig house, a peach house, a vinery, and other greenhouses. Wyatt's designs culminated in c. 1790 with the Great Barn, located in the park half a mile south-east of the obelisk. The cost of each farm was in the region of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,500 to <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>2,600: Lodge Farm, <a href="Castle%20Acre">Castle Acre</a>, cost <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>2,604 6s. 5d. in 1797–1800. The lake to the west of the house, originally a marshy inlet or <a href="Creek%20%28tidal%29">creek</a> off the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, was created in 1801–03 by the landscape gardener William Eames.

After his death, Coke was commemorated by the Coke Monument, designed by <a href="William%20Donthorne">William Donthorne</a> and erected in 1845–8 at a cost to the tenants of the estate of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>4,000. The monument consists of a Corinthian column high, surmounted by a drum supporting a wheatsheaf and a plinth decorated with bas-reliefs carved by John Henning, Jr. The corners of the plinth support sculptures of an ox, sheep, plough and seed-drill. Coke's work to increase farm yields had resulted in the rental income of the estate rising between 1776 and 1816 from <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>2,200 to <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>20,000, and had considerable influence on agricultural methods in Britain.

In 1850, <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester</a>, called in the architect <a href="William%20Burn">William Burn</a> to build new stables to the east of the house, in collaboration with <a href="W.%20A.%20Nesfield">W. A. Nesfield</a>, who had designed the <a href="parterre">parterre</a>s. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of <a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">Saint George and the Dragon</a> dated c. 1849–57 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone <a href="orangery">orangery</a>, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.

The cost of the construction of Holkham is thought to have been in the region of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>90,000. This vast cost nearly ruined the heirs of the 1st Earl, but had the result that they were financially unable to alter the house to suit the whims of taste. Thus, the house has remained almost untouched since its completion in 1764. Today, this perfect, if severe, example of Palladianism is at the heart of a thriving private estate of some . Though open to the public on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays, it is still the family home of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earls of Leicester</a> of Holkham.

Benjamin Mountfort

Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English emigrant to New Zealand, where he became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>'s unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of <a href="Canterbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Canterbury</a>. Heavily influenced by the <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholic</a> philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the <a href="Gothic%20revival">Gothic revival</a> style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.

Mountfort was born in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, an industrial town in the <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> of England, the son of perfume manufacturer and jeweller Thomas Mountfort and his wife Susanna (née Woolfield). As a young adult he moved to London, where he was an early pupil of <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a> (from 1841–46). He also studied architecture under the Anglo-Catholic architect <a href="Richard%20Cromwell%20Carpenter">Richard Cromwell Carpenter</a>, whose medieval <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style of design was to have a lifelong influence on Mountfort. After completion of his training in 1848, Mountfort practised architecture in London. He married Emily Elizabeth Newman on 20 August 1850, and 18 days later the couple emigrated to New Zealand. They were some of the first settlers to the province of Canterbury, arriving on one of the famed <a href="First%20Four%20Ships">First Four Ships</a>, the "<a href="Charlotte-Jane">Charlotte-Jane</a>" on 16 December 1850. These first settlers, known as "The Pilgrims", have their names engraved on marble plaques in <a href="Cathedral%20Square%2C%20Christchurch">Cathedral Square</a>, Christchurch, in front of the cathedral that Mountfort helped to design.

Mountfort arrived in Canterbury full of ambition and drive to begin designing in 1850 as one of a wave of settlers encouraged to immigrate to the new colony of New Zealand by the British Government. With him and his wife from England came also his brother Charles, his sister Susannah, and Charles' wife, all five of them aged between 21 and 26. Life in New Zealand at first was hard and disappointing: Mountfort found that there was little call for architects. Christchurch was little more than a large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain. The new émigré's architectural life in New Zealand had a disastrous beginning. His first commission in New Zealand was the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Lyttelton">Church of the Most Holy Trinity</a> in <a href="Lyttelton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Lyttelton</a>, built in 1852 by <a href="Isaac%20Luck">Isaac Luck</a>. The building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe. It was demolished in 1857. This calamity was attributed to the use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of the local building materials. Whatever the cause, the result was a crushing blow to his reputation. A local newspaper called him "... a half-educated architect whose buildings... have given anything but satisfaction, he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of the principles of construction, though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste.".

Due to this blow to his reputation, he began running a stationery shop, working as a newspaper agent, and giving drawing lessons until 1857 to supplement his architectural work. It was during this period in the architectural wilderness that he developed a lifelong interest in photography and supplemented his meagre income by taking photographic portraits.

Mountfort was a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> and an early member of the Lodge of Unanimity, the main building of which he designed in 1863. The Lodge of Unanimity was the first <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> in the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>.

In 1857 he returned to architecture and entered into a business partnership with his sister Susannah's new husband, Isaac Luck. Mountfort's career received a fillip when he was commissioned to design the St John's Anglican church at <a href="Waikouaiti">Waikouaiti</a> in Otago. A small timber structure in the Gothic style, it was completed on 19 December 1858 on land donated by the ex-whaler <a href="Johnny%20Jones%20%28pioneer%29">Johnny Jones</a>. It is still in use as a church, the oldest such structure in southern New Zealand. Now within the boundaries of the city of <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> its simple pit-sawn timber interior successfully conjures a sense of spirituality.

Christchurch was under heavy development at this time, as it had just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new <a href="Canterbury%20Provincial%20Council%20Buildings">Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings</a> in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an <a href="Victoria%20Clock%20Tower">iron clock tower</a> from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are regarded as one of Mountfort's most important works.

From the exterior, the building appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However the interior was a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought to be one of only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost <a href="John%20Ruskin">Ruskinesque</a> style, with carvings by a local sculptor <a href="William%20Brassington">William Brassington</a>. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.
The Gothic revival style of architecture began to gain in popularity from the late 18th century as a <a href="Romanticism">romantic</a> backlash against the more <a href="Classicism">classical</a> and formal styles which had predominated the previous two centuries. At the age of 16, Mountfort acquired two books written by the Gothic revivalist <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>: "The True Principles of Christian or Pointed Architecture" and "An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture." From this time onwards, Mountfort was a disciple of Pugin's strong Anglo-Catholic architectural values. These values were further cemented in 1846, at the age of 21, Mountfort became a pupil of Richard Cromwell Carpenter.

Carpenter was, like Mountfort, a devout Anglo-Catholic and subscribed to the theories of Tractarianism, and thus to the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20Movement">Cambridge Movement</a>s. These conservative theological movements taught that true spirituality and concentration in prayer was influenced by the physical surroundings, and that the medieval church had been more spiritual than that of the early 19th century. As a result of this theology, medieval architecture was declared to be of greater spiritual value than the classical <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a>-based styles of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Augustus Pugin even pronounced that medieval architecture was the only form suitable for a church and that Palladianism was almost heretical. Such theory was not confined to architects, and continued well into the 20th century. This school of thought led intellectuals such as the English poet <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> to prefer <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> buildings to <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> on the grounds that the latter represented an abandonment of the world of intellectual clarity and light for a set of values based on the notion of hell and the increasing dominance of society by bankers, a breed to be despised.

Whatever the philosophy behind the Gothic revival, in London the 19th-century rulers of the British Empire felt that Gothic architecture was suitable for the colonies because of its then strong Anglican connotations, representing hard work, morality and conversion of native peoples. The irony of this was that many of Mountfort's churches were for Roman Catholics, as so many of the new immigrants were of Irish origin. To the many middle-class English empire builders, Gothic represented a nostalgic reminder of the parishes left behind in Britain with their true medieval architecture; these were the patrons who chose the architects and designs.

Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of the more severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a>s and many <a href="gable">gable</a>s. As his career progressed, and he had proved himself to the employing authorities, his designs developed into a more European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which was in no way peculiar to Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as <a href="Alfred%20Waterhouse">Alfred Waterhouse</a> in Britain.

Mountfort's skill as an architect lay in adapting these flamboyant styles to suit the limited materials available in New Zealand. While wooden churches are plentiful in certain parts of the US, they are generally of a simple classic design, whereas Mountfort's wooden churches in New Zealand are as much ornate Gothic fantasies as those he designed in stone. Perhaps the flamboyance of his work can be explained in a statement of principles he and his partner Luck wrote when bidding to win the commission to design Government House, Auckland in 1857:

 
As the "Provincial Architect"—a newly created position to which Mountfort was appointed in 1864—Mountfort designed a wooden church for the Roman Catholic community of the city of Christchurch. This wooden erection was subsequently enlarged several times until it was renamed a cathedral. It was eventually replaced in 1901 by the <a href="Francis%20Petre%231904%20Cathedral%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Sacrament.2C%20Christchurch">Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, a more permanent stone building by the architect <a href="Francis%20Petre">Frank Petre</a>, though the <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> by Mountfort was preserved. Mountfort often worked in wood, a material he in no way regarded as an impediment to the Gothic style, though he was unique in this respect as Gothic buildings were often created from stone and mortar. Between 1869 and 1882 he designed the <a href="Canterbury%20Museum%2C%20Christchurch">Canterbury Museum</a> and subsequently <a href="University%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury College</a> and its clock tower in 1877.

Construction on the buildings for the Canterbury College, which later became the <a href="University%20of%20Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a>, began with the construction of the clock tower block. This edifice, which opened in 1877, was the first purpose built university in New Zealand. The College was completed in two subsequent stages in Mountfort's usual Gothic style.

<a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a>, the architect of <a href="ChristChurch%20Cathedral%2C%20Christchurch">ChristChurch Cathedral</a>, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the <a href="Clerk%20of%20Works">clerk of works</a> and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west <a href="porch">porch</a>. He also designed the <a href="baptismal%20font">font</a>, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral is very much in the European decorated Gothic style with an attached <a href="campanile">campanile</a> tower beside the body of the cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.

In 1872 Mountfort became a founding member of the Canterbury Association of Architects, a body which was responsible for all subsequent development of the new city. Mountfort was now at the pinnacle of his career. Mountfort notably altered the use of a segmented arch rather than one in the Romanesque style; the latter of which was considered by Augustus Pugin to be fundamentally important to the Gothic style. The college posed a challenge in its main hall; on the hall's completion in 1882, it was the largest public space in Christchurch. Additionally, a level of detail not possible in previous works was present in the hall's design due to the superior funding for the college. The completion of the first stage was met with praise and optimism, though extensions such as a biological lab were added in the early 1890s. By the 1880s, Mountfort was hailed as New Zealand's premier <a href="Church%20%28building%29">ecclesiastical</a> architect, with over forty churches to his credit.

In 1888, he designed St John's Cathedral in <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a>. This brick construction was demolished in the disastrous 1931 earthquake that destroyed much of Napier. Between 1886 and 1897, Mountfort worked on one of his largest churches, the wooden <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Cathedral%20Church">St Mary's</a>, the cathedral church of <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>. Covering , St Mary's is the largest and last timber church built by Mountfort, and the largest wooden Gothic church in the world. At its completion, it was said that "in point of design, completeness and beauty [it] reaches a high level mark not yet approached in the diocese". The emphasis placed on the sweeping roof by the great aisle windows struck a balance to the great area the church enclosed. In 1982 the entire church, complete with its stained glass windows, was transported to a new site, across the road from its former position where a new cathedral was to be built. St Mary's church was consecrated in 1898, one of Mountfort's final grand works.

Outside of his career, Mountfort was keenly interested in the arts and a talented artist, although his artistic work appears to have been confined to art pertaining to architecture, his first love. He was a devout member of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> and a member of many Anglican church councils and <a href="diocese">diocese</a> committees.

Mountfort's later years were blighted by professional jealousies, as his position as the province's first architect was assailed by new and younger men influenced by new orders of architecture. Benjamin Mountfort died in 1898, aged 73. He was buried in the cemetery of <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Avonside">Holy Trinity Avonside</a>, the church which he had extended in 1876.

Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has to avoid judging them against a background of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.

Christchurch and its surrounding areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of Gothic architecture, something that can be directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, <a href="Cyril%20Mountfort">Cyril</a>, continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of <a href="St%20Luke%27s%20Church%2C%20Christchurch">St Luke's in the City</a>, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary <a href="Robert%20Lawson%20%28architect%29">R A Lawson</a> as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.

Henry Moore

Henry Spencer Moore (30 July 1898 – 31 August 1986) was an English artist. He is best known for his semi-<a href="abstract%20art">abstract</a> monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. As well as sculpture, Moore produced many drawings, including a series depicting Londoners sheltering from <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> during the Second World War, along with other graphic works on paper.

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>.

Moore was born in <a href="Castleford">Castleford</a>, the son of a coal miner. He became well-known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of <a href="modernism">modernism</a> to the United Kingdom. His ability in later life to fulfil large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy. Despite this, he lived frugally; most of the money he earned went towards endowing the <a href="Henry%20Moore%20Foundation">Henry Moore Foundation</a>, which continues to support education and promotion of the arts.

Henry Moore was born in <a href="Castleford">Castleford</a>, <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale <a href="Coal%20mining">colliery</a> in Castleford. He was an <a href="autodidact">autodidact</a> with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in <a href="clay">clay</a> and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s achievements at a Sunday School reading.

On his second attempt he was accepted at <a href="Castleford%20Academy">Castleford Grammar School</a>, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in <a href="Gothic%20art">medieval sculpture</a>. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.

Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27%20Own%20Civil%20Service%20Rifles">Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles</a> regiment and was injured in 1917 in a <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gas attack</a>, on 30 November at <a href="Bourlon">Bourlon</a> Wood, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a <a href="physical%20fitness">physical training</a> instructor, only returning to France as <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">the Armistice</a> was signed. He recalled later, "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero." This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, in a letter to his friend Arthur Sale, that "a year or two after [the war] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and "anti-life". And I still have that feeling."

After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now <a href="Leeds%20College%20of%20Art">Leeds College of Art</a>), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met <a href="Barbara%20Hepworth">Barbara Hepworth</a>, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir <a href="Michael%20Ernest%20Sadler">Michael Sadler</a>, the University <a href="Vice-Chancellor">Vice-Chancellor</a>, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Art">Royal College of Art</a> in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of <a href="primitivism">primitive art</a> and sculpture, studying the <a href="ethnographic">ethnographic</a> collections at the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> and the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic <a href="Victorian%20decorative%20arts">Victorian</a> style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as <a href="Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i">Constantin Brâncuși</a>, <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>, <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a> and <a href="Frank%20Dobson%20%28sculptor%29">Frank Dobson</a> led him to the method of <a href="Glossary%20of%20sculpting">direct carving</a>, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by <a href="Francis%20Derwent%20Wood">Derwent Wood</a> (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble <a href="relief">relief</a> of <a href="Domenico%20Rosselli">Domenico Rosselli</a>'s "The Virgin and Child" by first modelling the relief in <a href="plaster">plaster</a>, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a "<a href="pointing%20machine">pointing machine</a>", a technique called "pointing". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.

In 1924, Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in <a href="Northern%20Italy">Northern Italy</a> studying the great works of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="Giotto%20di%20Bondone">Giotto di Bondone</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Pisano">Giovanni Pisano</a> and several other <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. During this period he also visited Paris, took advantage of the timed-sketching classes at the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Colarossi">Académie Colarossi</a>, and viewed, in the <a href="Trocad%C3%A9ro%23The%20old%20Palais%20du%20Trocad%C3%A9ro">Trocadero</a>, a plaster cast of a <a href="Toltec">Toltec</a>-<a href="Maya%20civilisation">Maya</a> sculptural form, the <a href="Chac%20Mool">Chac Mool</a>, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.

On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, "West Wind" (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s headquarters at <a href="55%20Broadway%2C%20London">55 Broadway</a>. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including <a href="Eric%20Gill">Eric Gill</a> with the ground-level pieces provided by <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Epstein</a>. 1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution</a> and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>.

Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband <a href="Ben%20Nicholson">Ben Nicholson</a> moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while <a href="Naum%20Gabo">Naum Gabo</a>, <a href="Roland%20Penrose">Roland Penrose</a>, <a href="Cecil%20Stephenson">Cecil Stephenson</a> and the art critic <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a> also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as "a nest of gentle artists"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the <a href="Chelsea%20School%20of%20Art">Chelsea School of Art</a>. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The <a href="Seven%20and%20Five%20Society">Seven and Five Society</a> would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, <a href="Georges%20Braque">Georges Braque</a>, <a href="Jean%20Arp">Jean Arp</a> and <a href="Alberto%20Giacometti">Alberto Giacometti</a>. Moore flirted with <a href="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>, joining <a href="Paul%20Nash%20%28artist%29">Paul Nash</a>'s <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a> movement "<a href="Unit%20One">Unit One</a>", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the <a href="cave%20of%20Altamira">cave of Altamira</a> (which he described as the "Royal Academy of Cave Painting"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.

Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, <a href="Roland%20Penrose">Roland Penrose</a> purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary <a href="maquette">maquette</a>s in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.

In 1938, Moore met <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Arts Council of Great Britain</a> he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

At the outbreak of the Second World War the Chelsea School of Art was evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post. During the war, Moore produced powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>. <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a>, the chairman of the <a href="War%20Artists%27%20Advisory%20Committee">War Artists' Advisory Committee</a> (WAAC), had previously tried to recruit Moore as a full-time salaried war artist and now agreed to purchase some of the shelter drawings and issued contracts for further examples. The shelter drawings WAAC acquired were completed between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941 and are regarded as among the finest products of the WAAC scheme. In August 1941 WAAC commissioned Moore to draw miners working underground at the Wheldale Colliery in Yorkshire, where his father had worked at the start of the century. Moore drew the people in the shelters as passively waiting the all-clear while miners aggressively worked the coal-faces. These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America where examples were included in the WAAC "Britain at War" exhibition which toured North America throughout the war.

After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of <a href="Perry%20Green%2C%20Hertfordshire">Perry Green</a> near <a href="Much%20Hadham">Much Hadham</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. This was to become Moore's home and workshop for the rest of his life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission from <a href="St%20Matthew%27s%20Church%2C%20Northampton">St Matthew's Church, Northampton</a>, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.

After the war and following several earlier miscarriages, Irina gave birth to their daughter, Mary Moore, in March 1946. The child was named after Moore's mother, who had died two years earlier. Both the loss of his mother and the arrival of a baby focused Moore's mind on the family, which he expressed in his work by producing many "mother-and-child" compositions, although reclining and internal/external figures also remained popular. In the same year, Moore made his first visit to America when a retrospective exhibition of his work opened at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York City. 

Before the war, Moore had been approached by educator <a href="Henry%20Morris%20%28education%29">Henry Morris</a>, who was trying to reform education with his concept of the <a href="Village%20College">Village College</a>. Morris had engaged <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> as the architect for his second village college at <a href="Impington%20Village%20College">Impington</a> near <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, and he wanted Moore to design a major public sculpture for the site. The County Council, however, could not afford Gropius's full design, and scaled back the project when Gropius emigrated to America. Lacking funds, Morris had to cancel Moore's sculpture, which had not progressed beyond the maquette stage. Moore was able to reuse the design in 1950 for a similar commission outside a secondary school for the new town of <a href="Stevenage">Stevenage</a>. This time, the project was completed and "<a href="Family%20Group%20%28Moore%29">Family Group</a>" became Moore's first large-scale public bronze.

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions. He exhibited at the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a> in 1951, and in 1958 produced a <a href="UNESCO%20Reclining%20Figure%201957-58">large marble reclining figure</a> for the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> building in Paris. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly and he started to employ an increasing number of assistants to work with him at Much Hadham, including <a href="Anthony%20Caro">Anthony Caro</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wentworth%20%28artist%29">Richard Wentworth</a>.

On the campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's "<a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20%28sculpture%29">Nuclear Energy</a>" was unveiled on the site of what was once the university's football field stands, in the <a href="rackets%20%28sport%29">rackets court</a> beneath which the experiments had taken place. This 12-foot-tall piece in the middle of a large, open plaza is often thought to represent a <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a> topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that they may have a feeling of being in a cathedral." In <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, Moore also commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named "<a href="Man%20Enters%20the%20Cosmos">Man Enters the Cosmos</a>" (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a> program.

The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the <a href="Belvedere%20%28fort%29">Forte di Belvedere</a> overlooking <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary "5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)" by American filmmaker <a href="Warren%20Forma">Warren Forma</a>. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed "<a href="Knife%20Edge%20Two%20Piece%201962%E2%80%9365">Knife Edge Two Piece</a>" in 1962 for <a href="College%20Green%2C%20London">College Green</a> near the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a> in London. According to Moore, "When I was offered the site near the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> ... I liked the place so much that I didn't bother to go and see an alternative site in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>—one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park. The House of Lords site is quite different. It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it."

As his wealth grew, Moore began to worry about his legacy. With the help of his daughter Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from <a href="Inheritance%20Tax%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">death duties</a>. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the <a href="Henry%20Moore%20Foundation">Henry Moore Foundation</a> as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at <a href="Perry%20Green%2C%20Hertfordshire">Perry Green</a>, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.

In 1979 Henry Moore became unexpectedly known in Germany when his sculpture "Large Two Forms" was installed in the forecourt of the <a href="Federal%20Chancellery%20%28Bonn%29">German Chancellery</a> in Bonn, which was the capital city of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> prior to German reunification in October 1990.

Moore died on 31 August 1986 (at the age of 88) at his home in Perry Green, near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. His body was interred at the churchyard of St. Thomas's Church.

Moore's signature form is a reclining figure. Moore's exploration of this form, under the influence of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.

Earlier figures are pierced in a conventional manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with <a href="Barbara%20Hepworth">Barbara Hepworth</a>'s sculptures. Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The plaster "" (1951) in the <a href="Tate">Tate</a>, is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. As with much of the post-War work, there are several bronze casts of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, ""All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. Everyone thinks that he or she looks but they don't really, you know."" 

Moore's early work is focused on <a href="Glossary%20of%20sculpting%23direct%20carving">direct carving</a>, in which the form of the sculpture evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into <a href="modernism">modernism</a> paralleled that of Barbara Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory <a href="Sketch%20%28drawing%29">sketches</a> and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; in old age, when he had arthritis, he continued to draw.
After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on their larger scale, which was particularly suited for public art commissions. As a matter of practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By the end of the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the <a href="Lost-wax%20casting">lost wax</a> technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.
At his home in Much Hadham, Moore built up a collection of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final <a href="Molding%20%28process%29">moulding</a> and <a href="casting">casting</a> at a bronze <a href="foundry">foundry</a>. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.

Moore produced at least three significant examples of architectural sculpture during his career. In 1928, despite his own self-described "extreme reservations", he accepted his first public commission for "West Wind" for the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> Building at <a href="55%20Broadway">55 Broadway</a> in London, joining the company of <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a> and <a href="Eric%20Gill">Eric Gill</a>. In 1953, he completed a four-part concrete screen for the Time-Life Building in New Bond Street, London, and in 1955 Moore turned to his first and only work in carved brick, "Wall Relief" at the Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam. The brick relief was sculpted with 16,000 bricks by two Dutch bricklayers under Moore's supervision.

The aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="The%20Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, and the age of the atomic bomb instilled in the sculpture of the mid-1940s a sense that art should return to its pre-cultural and pre-rational origins. In the literature of the day, writers such as <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> advocated a similar reductive philosophy. At an introductory speech in New York City for an exhibition of one of the finest <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> sculptors, <a href="Alberto%20Giacometti">Alberto Giacometti</a>, Sartre spoke of "The beginning and the end of history". Moore's sense of England emerging undefeated from siege led to his focus on pieces characterised by endurance and continuity.

Most sculptors who emerged during the height of Moore's fame, and in the aftermath of his death, found themselves cast in his shadow. By the late 1940s, Moore was a worldwide celebrity; he was the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. The next generation was constantly compared against him, and reacted by challenging his legacy, his "establishment" credentials and his position. At the 1952 <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>, eight new British sculptors produced their "<a href="Geometry%20of%20Fear">Geometry of Fear</a>" works as a direct contrast to the ideals behind Moore's idea of "Endurance, Continuity"; his large bronze "Double Standing Figure" stood outside the British pavilion, and contrasted strongly with the rougher and more angular works inside.

Yet Moore had a direct influence on several generations of sculptors of both British and international reputation. Among the artists who have acknowledged Moore's importance to their work are <a href="Sir%20Anthony%20Caro">Sir Anthony Caro</a>, <a href="Phillip%20King%20%28artist%29">Phillip King</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Witkin">Isaac Witkin</a>, all three having been assistants to Moore. Other artists whose work was influenced by him include <a href="Helaine%20Blumenfeld">Helaine Blumenfeld</a>, <a href="Drago%20Marin%20Cherina">Drago Marin Cherina</a>, <a href="Lynn%20Chadwick">Lynn Chadwick</a>, <a href="Eduardo%20Paolozzi">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Meadows">Bernard Meadows</a>, <a href="Reg%20Butler">Reg Butler</a>, <a href="William%20Turnbull%20%28artist%29">William Turnbull</a>, <a href="Robert%20Adams%20%28sculptor%20and%20designer%29">Robert Adams</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Armitage">Kenneth Armitage</a>, and Geoffrey Clarke.

In December 2005, the two ton "Reclining Figure" (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called "Sundial" (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 "Standing Figure" (1950), one of four Moore pieces in <a href="Glenkiln%20Sculpture%20Park">Glenkiln Sculpture Park</a>, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen.

In 2012, the council of the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Tower%20Hamlets">London Borough of Tower Hamlets</a> announced its plans to sell another version of "<a href="Draped%20Seated%20Woman%201957%E2%80%9358">Draped Seated Woman 1957–58</a>", a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed "Old Flo", it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the <a href="Yorkshire%20Sculpture%20Park">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a> in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving "<a href="Draped%20Seated%20Woman">Draped Seated Woman</a>" to private land in <a href="Canary%20Wharf">Canary Wharf</a> but instead chose to "explore options" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by <a href="Sir%20Nicholas%20Serota">Sir Nicholas Serota</a>, Director of the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, by filmmaker <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>, and by artists including <a href="Jeremy%20Deller">Jeremy Deller</a>. The letter said that the sale "goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale" of the work.

Today, the <a href="Henry%20Moore%20Foundation">Henry Moore Foundation</a> manages the artist's former home at Perry Green in Hertfordshire as a visitor destination, with 70 acres of sculpture grounds as well as his restored house and studios. It also runs the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds which organises exhibitions and research activities in international sculpture. Popular interest in Moore's work was perceived by some to have declined for a while in the UK but has been revived in recent times by exhibitions including Henry Moore at Tate Britain in 2010 and Moore at Kew and Hatfield in 2007 and 2011 respectively. The Foundation he endowed continues to play an essential role in promoting contemporary art in the United Kingdom and abroad through its grants and exhibitions programme.

The world's largest collection of Moore's work is open to the public and is housed in the house and grounds of the 60-acre estate, that was Moore's home for forty years, in <a href="Perry%20Green%2C%20Hertfordshire">Perry Green, Hertfordshire</a>. The site and the collection are now owned by the <a href="Henry%20Moore%20Foundation">Henry Moore Foundation</a>.

In December 2005, thieves entered a courtyard at the Henry Moore Foundation and stole a cast of Moore's "<a href="Reclining%20Figure%201969-70">Reclining Figure 1969-70</a>" (LH 608) – a 3.6 metre-long, 2.1-tonne bronze sculpture. Closed-circuit-television footage showed that they used a crane to lower the piece onto a stolen flatbed truck. A substantial reward was offered by the Foundation for information leading to its recovery. By May 2009, after a thorough investigation, British officials said they believe the work, once valued at £3 million (US$5.3 million), was probably sold for <a href="scrap%20metal">scrap metal</a>, fetching about £5,000. In July 2012 the bronze "Sundial 1965", valued at £500,000, was stolen from the Moore Foundation. Later that year, following the details of the theft being publicised on the BBC <a href="Crimewatch">Crimewatch</a> television programme, the work was recovered, and the thieves were sentenced to twelve months' custody.

Moore presented 36 sculptures, as well as drawings, maquettes and other works to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> in 1978.

The Henry Moore Sculpture Centre in the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a>, Toronto, opened in 1974. It comprises the world's largest public collection of Moore's work, most of it donated by him between 1971 and 1974. Moore's "Three Way Piece No. 2 (The Archer)" has also been on display in <a href="Nathan%20Phillips%20Square">Nathan Phillips Square</a> at <a href="Toronto%20City%20Hall">Toronto City Hall</a> since 1966.

In 1948, Moore won the International Sculpture Prize at the <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>. He turned down a <a href="knight">knight</a>hood in 1951 because he felt that the bestowal would lead to a perception of him as an establishment figure and that "such a title might tend to cut me off from fellow artists whose work has aims similar to mine". He was, however, awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in 1955, the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1963 and <a href="Erasmus%20Prize">Erasmus Prize</a> in 1968.

He was a trustee of both the <a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery</a> and <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>. His proposal that a wing of the latter should be devoted to his sculptures aroused hostility among some artists. In 1975, he became the first President of the Turner Society, which had been founded to campaign for a separate museum in which the whole Turner Bequest might be reunited, an aim defeated by the National Gallery and Tate Gallery.

Given to the City of London by Moore and the Contemporary Art Society in 1967, "<a href="Knife%20Edge%20Two%20Piece%201962%E2%80%9365">Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65</a>" is displayed in <a href="College%20Green%2C%20London">Abingdon Street Gardens</a>, opposite the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a>, where its regular appearance in the background of televised news reports from Westminster makes it Moore's most prominent piece in Britain. The ownership of "Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65" was disputed until its 2011 acquisition by the Parliamentary Art Collection.

By the end of his career, Moore was the world's most successful living artist at auction. In 1982, four years before his death, <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> in New York sold a 6 ft "Reclining Figure" (1945), for $1.2 million to collector Wendell Cherry. Although a first record of $4.1 million was set in 1990, Moore's market slumped during the recession that followed. In 2012, his eight-foot bronze, "" (1951) sold for a record £19.1 million at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a>, making him the second most expensive 20th-century British artist after <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>.

Banksia spinulosa

The hairpin banksia ("Banksia spinulosa") is a species of woody <a href="shrub">shrub</a>, of the genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, native to eastern <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Widely distributed, it is found as an <a href="understorey">understorey</a> plant in open dry forest or <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heathland</a> from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> to northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, generally on sandstone though sometimes also clay soils. It generally grows as a small shrub to in height, though can be a straggly tree to . It has long narrow leaves with <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s which can vary considerably in coloration; while the spikes are gold or less commonly yellowish, the emergent styles may be a wide range of colours – from black, purple, red, orange or yellow.

"Banksia spinulosa" was named by <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a> in England in 1793, after being collected by <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a>, most likely in 1792. He gave it the common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the <a href="New%20England%20%28Australia%29">New England region</a>, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var. "cunninghamii", is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on "Banksia", <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>, concedes there is still more work to be done on the "Banksia spinulosa" complex.

The hairpin banksia is <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by and provides food for a wide array of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals in the autumn and winter months. Its floral display and fine foliage have made it a popular garden plant with many horticultural selections available. With the recent trend towards smaller gardens, compact dwarf forms of "Banksia spinulosa" have become popular; the first available, <a href="Banksia%20%27Birthday%20Candles%27">"Banksia" 'Birthday Candles'</a>, has achieved a great deal of commercial success and wide recognition, and has been followed by several others.

The hairpin banksia usually occurs as a multi-<a href="plant%20stem">stemmed</a> <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>ous shrub tall and across. Alternatively, it may be single-stemmed and lacking a lignotuber, in which case it is often taller, up to high. It has grey or grey-brown smooth bark with <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s. The long, narrow leaves are in length, 1–8 mm wide and more or less <a href="leaf%20shape">linear in shape</a>. Leaf edges are either <a href="wikt%3Aserrate">serrate</a> for the entire leaf length ("collina") or toward the apex only ("spinulosa"), though the margins may be recurved and hence serrations not evident as in those from the <a href="Carnarvon%20Gorge">Carnarvon Gorge</a>. Immature leaves, which may also be seen after bushfire, are broader and serrated. Leaf undersides have fine white hairs in the case of the varieties "spinulosa" and "collina" and pale brown in "cunninghamii" and "neoanglica".

The distinctive <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s or flower spikes occur over a short period through autumn and early winter. A spike may contain hundreds or thousands of individual flowers, each of which consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are hooked rather than straight. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. In "Banksia spinulosa" the spikes are cylindrical, about wide and tall, yellow to golden orange in colour, with styles varying from yellow to pink, maroon, or black. Styles of various colours may be found within metres of each other in some areas such as in the <a href="Georges%20River%20National%20Park">Georges River National Park</a>, and <a href="Catherine%20Hill%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Catherine Hill Bay</a>, while other populations may have uniformly black, red or gold styles. Though not terminal, the flower spikes are fairly prominently displayed. Partly emerging from the foliage, they arise from two- to three-year-old stem nodes.

The hairpin banksia's infructescence is a typical "Banksia" <a href="conifer%20cone">cone</a>-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> which are 1–2.4 centimetres (⅓–1 in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>. The nonlignotuberous subspecies "cunninghamii" is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds around the base of the lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var. "spinulosa" and var. "collina" are generally bare.

The first known specimens of "B. spinulosa" were collected near <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> by <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a>, Surgeon General to the British colony of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, sometime between 1788 and 1793. He called it "prickly-leaved banksia", though this name has fallen out of use. It is uncertain exactly when he first collected the species; it may have been before 1790, as there is speculation that a sketch in his 1790 "<a href="Journal%20of%20a%20Voyage%20to%20New%20South%20Wales">Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales</a>" is of a "B. spinulosa" infructescence. Text accompanying the figure states 

English botanist <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a> later tentatively attributed this figure to "B. spinulosa": More recently, however, Alf Salkin has argued that 

White probably collected the type material of "B. spinulosa" in 1792. The following year, the species was formally described by Smith in his "<a href="A%20Specimen%20of%20the%20Botany%20of%20New%20Holland">A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland</a>". It was thus the seventh "Banksia" species collected, and the fifth described. Smith gave it the specific epithet "spinulosa", a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> term meaning "having minute spines", probably in reference to the leaf tips. Thus the species' full name is "Banksia spinulosa" Sm.

In the first infrageneric arrangement of "Banksia", <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">that of Brown in 1830</a>, "B. spinulosa" was placed in subgenus "Banksia verae", the "true banksias", because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. It was placed next to "B. cunninghamii" and "B. collina", both now considered varieties of "B. spinulosa"; these three were placed between "<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">B. ericifolia</a>" (heath-leaved banksia) and "<a href="Banksia%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>" (red swamp banksia). "Banksia verae" was renamed "<a href="Eubanksia">Eubanksia</a>" by <a href="Stephan%20Ladislaus%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847. <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> demoted "Eubanksia" to sectional rank in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 classification</a>, and divided it into four series, with "B. spinulosa" placed in series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">Abietinae</a>", while "B. cunninghamii" and "B. collina" were placed alongside each other in series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">Salicinae</a>". When <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1870 arrangement</a> in "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>", he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named "<a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">Oncostylis</a>". "B. cunninghamii" was reduced to synonymy with "B. collina", as was the western species "<a href="Banksia%20littoralis">B. littoralis</a>" (western swamp banksia). This arrangement would stand for over a century.

<a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> published a new taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia" in his landmark 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections, one of which was "Oncostylis". "Oncostylis" was further divided into four series, with "B. spinulosa" placed in series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Spicigerae">"Spicigerae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus, after <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analyses yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B. spinulosa" in series "Spicigerae", placing it alone in "B." subser. "Spinulosae". This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the <a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">"Flora of Australia" series</a>.

Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia"</a>, "B. spinulosa"s taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows:

More recent molecular research suggests that "B. spinulosa" and "B. ericifolia" may be more closely related to series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>, with "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>" and its relatives.

In 2005, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a>, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for "Banksia". They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. spinulosa" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

Four varieties are currently recognised:



Some doubt exists as to whether the current classification accurately represents relationships within the "Banksia spinulosa" complex. "B. spinulosa" var. "collina" is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, but is a coastal plant on the New South Wales central and north coast. "B. spinulosa" var. "spinulosa", on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, "B. spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii" is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called "B. prionophylla" by Meissner). Notably both "B. spinulosa" var. "spinulosa" and "B. spinulosa" var. "collina" in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed "B. spinulosa" var. "collina" and "B. spinulosa" var. "neoanglica" as sister <a href="clade">clade</a>s in 1998, with "B. spinulosa" var. "spinulosa" and "B. spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii" flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland eastern states they occur would shed light on this matter.

<a href="Natural%20hybrid">Natural hybrid</a>s between "B. s." var. "spinulosa" and "B. ericifolia" subsp. "ericifolia" have been recorded at <a href="Pigeon%20House%20Mountain">Pigeon House Mountain</a> in Morton National Park. <a href="Banksia%20%27Giant%20Candles%27">"Banksia" "Giant Candles"</a> was a chance garden hybrid between "B. ericifolia" and "B. spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii".

The hairpin banksia occurs along the east coast of Australia from the <a href="Dandenong%20Ranges">Dandenong Ranges</a> east of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, north through <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and into <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. It is common north to <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Queensland">Maryborough</a>, with disjunct populations occurring as far north as the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> near <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from coastal <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> ("spinulosa" and "collina") and elevated rocky slopes ("neoanglica" and "spinulosa") to inland dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest dominated by <a href="eucalyptus">eucalypts</a>, where they form part of the understorey. Plants in exposed areas are generally considerably shorter than those in sheltered areas. It usually occurs on sand, but can be found in rocky clays or loams.

"Banksia spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii" is found in three disjunct regions; the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, East Gippsland between <a href="Lakes%20Entrance%2C%20Victoria">Lakes Entrance</a> and <a href="Eden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Eden</a>, and in the Great Dividing Range in a band from <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a> to <a href="Glen%20Davis%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Glen Davis</a> in Central New South Wales, while there have been collections northwards in the Dividing Range up into southeast Queensland. It can be an understorey plant under dense as well as open forest cover.

Like other banksias, "Banksia spinulosa" plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of <a href="nectar">nectar</a> in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. Banksias have been the subject of many studies about their pollination; "B. spinulosa" is no exception. A 1998 study in <a href="Bungawalbin%20National%20Park">Bungawalbin National Park</a> in Northern New South Wales found that "B. spinulosa" var. "collina" inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, including <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s such as "<a href="Antechinus%20flavipes">Antechinus flavipes</a>" (yellow-footed antechinus), which carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectar-eating birds, making them effective pollinators. The same study noted that, unlike other banksias studied, "B. spinulosa" var. "collina" was visited predominantly by native bees rather than the introduced "<a href="Apis%20mellifera">Apis mellifera</a>" (European honeybee).

A great many bird species have been observed visiting this species. A 1982 study in the <a href="New%20England%20National%20Park">New England National Park</a> in North-eastern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> found that a large influx of "<a href="Acanthorhynchus%20tenuirostris">Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris</a>" (eastern spinebill) coincided with the start of local "B. spinulosa"s flowering. In the Blackdown Tableland, "<a href="Lichenostomus%20leucotis">Lichenostomus leucotis</a>" (white-eared honeyeater) and "<a href="Lichenostomus%20melanops">Lichenostomus melanops</a>" (yellow-tufted honeyeater) as well as <a href="pygmy%20possum">pygmy possum</a>s visit "B. spinulosa". <a href="Brown%20antechinus">Brown antechinus</a>, <a href="sugar%20glider">sugar glider</a>, and <a href="bush%20rat">bush rat</a> are also known to visit flowers. Additional species seen in "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" survey include "<a href="Phylidonyris%20nigra">Phylidonyris nigra</a>" (white-cheeked honeyeater), "<a href="Phylidonyris%20pyrrhoptera">Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera</a>" (crescent honeyeater), "<a href="Meliphaga%20lewinii">Meliphaga lewinii</a>" (Lewin's honeyeater), "<a href="Lichmera%20indistincta">Lichmera indistincta</a>" (brown honeyeater), "<a href="Manorina%20melanocephala">Manorina melanocephala</a>" (noisy miner), "<a href="Philemon%20corniculatus">Philemon corniculatus</a>" (noisy friarbird), "<a href="Anthochaera%20carunculata">Anthochaera carunculata</a>" (red wattlebird) and "<a href="Eopsaltria%20australis">Eopsaltria australis</a>" (eastern yellow robin).

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. spinulosa" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance <a href="solubility">solubilisation</a> of <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, allowing nutrient <a href="mineral%20uptake">uptake</a> in low-nutrient soils such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>.

"B. spinulosa" does not appear to be under threat. It is resistant to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback, which poses a major threat to many other "Banksia" species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it does not appear on the <a href="list%20of%20threatened%20Australian%20plants">list of threatened Australian plants</a> under the <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>.

"Banksia spinulosa" is listed in Part 1 Group 1 of Schedule 13 of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974"; this means that as a common and secure species it is exempted from any licensing or tagging requirements under the 2002–2005 management plan to minimise and regulate the use of protected and threatened plants in the cut-flower industry in New South Wales.

"Banksia spinulosa" var. "spinulosa" was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> who supplied seed to <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew</a>, <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Botanic%20Garden">Cambridge Botanic Gardens</a> and <a href="Woburn%20Abbey">Woburn Abbey</a> among others; var. "collina" followed in 1800 and var. "cunninghamii" in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from <a href="Wianamatta%20shale">Wianamatta shale</a>s may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a>, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, "Banksia spinulosa" is particularly sensitive to <a href="Iron%20deficiency%20%28plant%20disorder%29">iron deficiency</a>. Known as <a href="chlorosis">chlorosis</a>, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and occurs when the plant is grown in soils of higher <a href="pH">pH</a>. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">sulfate</a>.

Regular <a href="pruning">pruning</a> is important to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This is not the case for var. "cunninghamii" which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cutting</a>-grown plant. "Banksia spinulosa" can be propagated easily by seed, and is one of the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.

Both "B. s." var. "collina" and var. "spinulosa" are commonly seen in nurseries; given that the varieties can hybridise, attempting to find a local provenance form from a local community nursery, <a href="Bushcare%20Group">Bushcare</a> or <a href="Australian%20Plants%20Society">Australian Plants Society</a> group is preferable environmentally if they are intended for planting in gardens near bushland where native populations occur. There are some dwarf forms available for the city gardener – 'Stumpy Gold' is a form of variety "collina" originally from the <a href="Central%20Coast%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Central Coast</a>, while 'Birthday Candles', 'Coastal Cushion' and 'Golden Cascade' are forms of variety "spinulosa" from the <a href="South%20Coast%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">South Coast</a> of New South Wales.

There are a number of commercial varieties available from Australian retail nurseries, four have been registered under <a href="plant%20breeders%27%20rights">plant breeders' rights</a> legislation, and another with the <a href="Australian%20Cultivar%20Registration%20Authority">Australian Cultivar Registration Authority</a>. The lack of official names has led to some varieties bearing several different names.

Banksia aemula

Banksia aemula, commonly known as the wallum banksia, is a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. Found from <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a> south to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on the Australian east coast, it is encountered as a shrub or a tree to in coastal <a href="heath">heath</a> on deep sandy soil, known as <a href="Wallum">Wallum</a>. It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> appear. "Banksia aemula" resprouts from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s.

First described by the botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> in the early 19th century, it derives its specific name "similar" from its resemblance to the closely related "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">Banksia serrata</a>". No <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> are recognised. It was known for many years in New South Wales as "Banksia serratifolia", contrasting with the use of "B.aemula" elsewhere. However, the former name, originally coined by <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Anthony Salisbury</a>, proved invalid, and "Banksia aemula" has been universally adopted as the correct <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a> since 1981. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences and are instrumental in pollination; <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s are particularly prominent visitors. Grown as a garden plant, it is less commonly seen in horticulture than its close relative "B.serrata".

"Banksia aemula" is generally a gnarled shrub or small tree to , although usually smaller. Conversely, individual wallum banksias have been measured at high, with a maximum diameter at breast height of in forest on <a href="North%20Stradbroke%20Island">North Stradbroke Island</a>. The trunk has thick orange-brown wrinkled and warty bark, and the new growth is hairy but becomes smooth as it ages. New shoot growth is in spring and summer. The shiny green leaves are <a href="leaf%20shape">obovate</a> to oblong in shape and measure in length, and in width. The leaf ends are truncate and the margins flat and <a href="leaf">serrated</a>. Flowering is in autumn, from March to June; the green-yellow flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are terminal, found on the ends of branches and emerging from the foliage. Measuring in height and in width, they are various shades of pale and greenish yellow. Anywhere from 800 to 1700 individual small flowers arise from a central woody spike (or <a href="rachis">rachis</a>). Initially tipped with white conical pollen presenters, the flowers open sequentially from the bottom to the top of the flower spike over one to two weeks, in a process known as sequential <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. Each flower produces nectar for around seven days after opening. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and up to 25 finely furred grey <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> appear, which can be very large, measuring long, high, and wide. They split open either after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> or spontaneously, and release oval seeds in length, composed of a wedge-shaped body long and wide, and curved wing wide. "Banksia aemula" resprouts from its woody <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> after fire.

"B. aemula" closely resembles "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">Banksia serrata</a>", but the latter can be distinguished by a greyer, not orange-brown, trunk, and adult leaves wider than in diameter. Inflorescences of "serrata" are generally a duller grey-yellow in colour, and have longer (23mm), more fusiform (spindle-shaped) or cylindrical pollen presenters tipping unopened flowers. Finally, the follicles are smaller.

"Banksia aemula" was called "wallum" by the Kabi people of the <a href="Sunshine%20Coast%2C%20Queensland">Sunshine Coast</a>, giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia but also to the name of the ecological community it grows in. <a href="Frederick%20Manson%20Bailey">Frederick Manson Bailey</a> reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as "mintie". "Banyalla" is another aboriginal name for the species.

"Banksia aemula" was collected by Scottish botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> in June 1801 in the vicinity of <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a>, and published by him in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>". The specific name, Latin for "similar", refers to its similarity to "B.serrata". Brown also collected a taller tree-like specimen from Sandy Cape which he called "Banksia elatior"; the specific name is the <a href="comparative">comparative</a> form of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "ēlātus" "elevated".

For many years in New South Wales, the wallum banksia had gone by the scientific name of "Banksia serratifolia". <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Anthony Salisbury</a> had published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>, and then <a href="Karel%20Domin">Karel Domin</a> in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> conclusively established "aemula" as the correct name to be used in his 1981 revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>"—the description could have fit juvenile leaves of "<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B.paludosa</a>" as well. In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether "serratifolia" applied to what he called "Banksia aemula". Salisbury's taxon appeared as "Banksia serraefolia" in <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Knight's</a> 1809 work "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", but that entry might also refer to "serrata". Where Salisbury got his material is unclear, but <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a> had sent material to <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a> now held in the Linnean Society marked as "B.serratifolia" Salisb. as well as "B.aemula" R.Br.

Under <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Brown's taxonomic arrangement</a>, "B.aemula" and "B.elatior" were placed in <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. "Banksia verae" was renamed "<a href="Eubanksia">Eubanksia</a>" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, and demoted to <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sectional</a> rank by <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 classification</a>. Meissner further divided "Eubanksia" into four <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a>, with "B.aemula" placed in series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">Quercinae</a>" on the basis of its toothed leaves. When <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1870 arrangement</a> in "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>", he discarded Meissner's series, replacing them with four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a>. "B.aemula" was placed in "Orthostylis", a somewhat heterogeneous section containing 18 species. This arrangement would stand for over a century.

In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B.aemula" as "Sirmuellera serratifolia". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally conserved.

Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia" in his classic 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B."subg. "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections. "B.aemula" was placed in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B."sect. "Banksia"</a>, and this was further divided into nine series, with "B.aemula" placed in <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">"B."ser. "Banksia"</a>.
He thought its closest relative was clearly "Banksia serrata" and then "B.ornata", and that the three formed a link with western species. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as <a href="syntype">syntype</a>s (shared <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a>s) for the species, George also chose a <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> (a single specimen to serve as the type specimen).

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus, after <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analyses yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B.aemula" in series "Banksia", placing it in <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Banksia">"B."subser. "Banksia"</a> along with "serrata" as its sister taxon (united by their unusual seedling leaves) and "ornata" as next closest relative. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series.

Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia"</a>, "B.aemula"s taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows:

In 2002, a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> again showed the three eastern species to form a group, but they were only distantly related to other members of the series "Banksia". Instead, they formed a sister group to a large group comprising the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Prostratae">Prostratae</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Ochraceae">Ochraceae</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Tetragonae">Tetragonae</a> (including "Banksia elderiana"), "<a href="Banksia%20lullfitzii">Banksia lullfitzii</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20baueri">Banksia baueri</a>".

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia". They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B."subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B."subg. "Banksia"</a>. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B.aemula" is placed in "B."subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia aemula" is found along the east coast of Australia from around north of <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a> in central Queensland down to Sydney. Specifically, its southernmost occurrence is at <a href="La%20Perouse%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">La Perouse</a> on the northern side of <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a>. It is also found on <a href="Fraser%20Island">Fraser</a>, <a href="Moreton%20Island">Moreton</a> and North Stradbroke Islands. Almost all populations are within a few kilometres of the coast, except for one at <a href="Agnes%20Banks%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Agnes Banks</a> in western Sydney, and two just north and south of <a href="Grafton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Grafton</a> at Coaldale and <a href="Glenreagh">Glenreagh</a>, and a last around southwest of Bundaberg.

"B. aemula" is most commonly found in deep sandy soils, either on dunes or flattish areas which may be seasonally wet. On coastal dunes in southern Queensland, it replaces "Banksia serrata", which occupies the same niche to the south. The latter areas, with open woodland or heathland, are known as <a href="wallum">wallum</a>. In Queensland it is found with "<a href="Banksia%20robur">Banksia robur</a>", with the latter species found in flatter wetter areas and "B.aemula" found on rises. It is also found with "<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">Banksia oblongifolia</a>" in Queensland. In some areas of wallum, it may grow as a small tree, along with <a href="Mallee%20%28habit%29">mallee forms</a> of the red bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">Corymbia gummifera</a>"). In <a href="Cooloola%20National%20Park">Cooloola National Park</a>, it is an occasional emergent plant (along with "<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>" and "<a href="Eucalyptus%20umbra">Eucalyptus umbra</a>") in closed graminoid heathland, a community of shrubs high containing "<a href="Xanthorrhoea%20fulva">Xanthorrhoea fulva</a>", "<a href="Empodisma%20minus">Empodisma minus</a>", "<a href="Petrophile%20shirleyae">Petrophile shirleyae</a>", and "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>" and "<a href="Leptospermum">Leptospermum</a>" species. On the New South Wales Central Coast, it generally grows as a high shrub and is a canopy component of "Banksia aemula" open heathland, located on coastal headlands on highly leached <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> white sands overlying Triassic and Permian strata. Areas include Wybung Head in <a href="Munmorah%20State%20Conservation%20Area">Munmorah State Conservation Area</a>, and near <a href="Myall%20Lakes">Myall Lakes</a>. Other plants it grows in association with include "<a href="Ricinocarpos%20pinifolius">Ricinocarpos pinifolius</a>", "<a href="Brachyloma%20daphnoides">Brachyloma daphnoides</a>", "<a href="Dillwynia%20glaberrima">Dillwynia glaberrima</a>", "<a href="Dillwynia%20retorta">D. retorta</a>", "<a href="Allocasuarina%20distyla">Allocasuarina distyla</a>", "<a href="Bossiaea%20ensata">Bossiaea ensata</a>", "<a href="Aotus%20ericoides">Aotus ericoides</a>", "<a href="Phyllota%20phylicoides">Phyllota phylicoides</a>", and "Empodisma minus". Sandmining has eradicated much of the community around <a href="Redhead%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Redhead</a>. In less leached yellower sands, the community (and "B.aemula") is replaced by a taller heath containing "B.serrata" and "B.oblongifolia".

At the southern end of its range, "B. aemula" is a component of the <a href="Eastern%20Suburbs%20Banksia%20Scrub">Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub</a> (ESBS), designated an endangered ecological community. This community is found on younger, windblown sands than the heathlands to the north.

The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an "Endangered Ecological Community". Here "Banksia aemula" is an <a href="understory">understory</a> plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">Eucalyptus sclerophylla</a>"), narrow-leaved apple ("<a href="Angophora%20bakeri">Angophora bakeri</a>") and "B. serrata" as canopy trees, and "B. oblongifolia", "<a href="Conospermum%20taxifolium">Conospermum taxifolium</a>", "Ricinocarpus pinifolius", "<a href="Dillwynia%20sericea">Dillwynia sericea</a>" and nodding geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20nutans">Persoonia nutans</a>") as other understory species.

On North Stradbroke Island, "B. aemula" is one of three canopy tree species of "<a href="Eucalyptus%20signata">Eucalyptus signata</a>"-dominated forest high, the third species being "E.umbra". This forest is found on a ridge above sea level formed from an ancient sand dune. Here bracken ("<a href="Pteridium%20esculentum">Pteridium esculentum</a>") dominates the understory. Other tall shrubs associated include "<a href="Persoonia%20cornifolia">Persoonia cornifolia</a>" and "<a href="Acacia%20concurrens">Acacia concurrens</a>".

Most <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> and all "Banksia" species, including "B.aemula", have <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including "B.aemula", found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.

A 1998 study in <a href="Bundjalung%20National%20Park">Bundjalung National Park</a> in northern New South Wales found that "B.aemula" inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small <a href="mammals">mammals</a>, including <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s such as <a href="yellow-footed%20antechinus">yellow-footed antechinus</a> ("Antechinus flavipes"), and <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s such as <a href="pale%20field%20rat">pale field rat</a> ("Rattus tunneyi"), <a href="Australian%20swamp%20rat">Australian swamp rat</a> ("R. lutreolus") and <a href="grassland%20melomys">grassland melomys</a> ("Melomys burtoni") and even the <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. <a href="Grey-headed%20flying%20fox">Grey-headed flying fox</a>es ("Pteropus poliocephalus") were also observed visiting "B.aemula" and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of "B.aemula" include <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a> and <a href="scarlet%20honeyeater">scarlet</a> and <a href="Lewin%27s%20honeyeater">Lewin's honeyeater</a>s. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on "B.aemula" inflorescences for "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>", including the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland</a>, <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown</a>, <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked</a>, and <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a>s, <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a>, <a href="little%20wattlebird">little wattlebird</a> and <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a>. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of "B.aemula" pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced honeyeater</a>s and <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a>s. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.

"Banksia aemula" resprouts from a lignotuber or shoots from epicormic buds after fire. Fire management of "Banksia aemula" heath in Southeast Queensland recommends 7- to 20-year fire intervals. Intervals of 10–15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by "<a href="Leptospermum%20laevigatum">Leptospermum laevigatum</a>". Experimenting with seed germination and early growth of "B.aemula" showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, inhibiting growth at double normal soil concentrations and causing seedling death at quadruple normal soil concentrations. The addition of potassium or magnesium ameliorated these effects a little although potassium in high concentrations impacted on growth as well. Overall, seedlings grow slowly over the first 21 weeks of life compared with other plant species, the reasons for which are unclear, although it may be that it offers an increased chance of survival in a nutrient- or water-poor environment. Seed was killed by exposure to 150°C, but survived seven-minute exposure to 100°C.

A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found "B.aemula" grew on ridges (dry heath) and "B. oblongifolia" on slopes (wet heath), and the two species did not overlap. Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that "B. aemula" grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at <a href="Broadwater%20National%20Park">Broadwater National Park</a> and <a href="Dirrawong%20Reserve">Dirrawong Reserve</a> on the New South Wales <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast">North Coast</a> showed that generally "Banksia aemula" produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at <a href="Crowdy%20Bay%20National%20Park">Crowdy Bay National Park</a> showed that "Banksia aemula" seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in the presence or absence of recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, "B.aemula" was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.

In 1788, "Banksia aemula" was one of the first banksias to be cultivated in England, where it was illustrated in "<a href="Curtis%27s%20Botanical%20Magazine">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</a>" and its rival, "<a href="The%20Botanical%20Register">The Botanical Register</a>". Its shiny green leaves, showy flower spikes, huge follicles, and wrinkled bark are attractive horticultural features. It is also a bird- and insect-attracting plant.

Trials in Western Australia and Hawaii have shown "B. aemula" to be resistant to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback. It requires a well drained slightly acid (<a href="pH">pH</a> 5.5–6.5) soil, preferably fairly sandy and a sunny aspect. Summer watering is also prudent, as it does not suffer water stress well. Slow-growing, the plant takes four to six years to flower from seed. It is less commonly grown than "Banksia serrata". An investigation into optimum temperatures for germination found a nighttime temperature of 20–28°C, and a daytime of 24–33°C gave best results, and recommended summer planting times.

It has also been used as a rootstock for grafting "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">Banksia speciosa</a>", and has potential in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>. The red textured timber has been used in cabinet-making.

Although "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">Banksia attenuata</a>" was the common banksia in Australian children's author <a href="May%20Gibbs">May Gibbs</a>' own childhood in Western Australia, the old flower spikes of "Banksia aemula" with their large follicles are thought to have been the inspiration for the villains of her <a href="Snugglepot%20and%20Cuddlepie">Snugglepot and Cuddlepie</a> books, the "Big Bad Banksia Men".

Banksia attenuata

Banksia attenuata, commonly known as the candlestick banksia, slender banksia or biara as known by the <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> aboriginal people, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="plant">plant</a> in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. Commonly a <a href="tree">tree</a>, it reaches high, but is often a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> in drier areas high. It has long narrow serrated <a href="leaf">leaves</a> and bright yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, or flower spikes, held above the foliage, which appear in spring and summer. The flower spikes age to grey and swell with the development of the woody <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. It is found across much of the <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, from north of <a href="Kalbarri%20National%20Park">Kalbarri National Park</a> down to <a href="Cape%20Leeuwin">Cape Leeuwin</a> and across to <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a>.

<a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> had named material collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> "Banksia cylindrostachya" in 1840, but this proved to be the same as the species named "Banksia attenuata" by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> 30 years earlier in 1810, and thus Brown's name took precedence. Within the genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>", the close relationships and exact position of "B. attenuata" is unclear.

The candlestick banksia is <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by and <a href="herbivore">provides food</a> for a wide array of animals in summer months. Several species of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a> visit the flower spikes, as does the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a>, which has an important role as a pollinator. It regenerates from <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> by regrowing from its woody base known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, or from <a href="epicormic%20bud">epicormic bud</a>s within its trunk. Plants may have a lifespan of 300 years. It has been widely used as a <a href="urban%20forestry">street tree</a> and for <a href="amenity">amenities</a> planting in urban Western Australia, though its large size generally precludes use in small gardens. A <a href="Dwarfing%23Plants">dwarf form</a> is commercially available in nurseries.

"Banksia attenuata" is generally encountered as a tree up to tall. In the north of its range as the climate becomes warmer and drier, it is often a stunted multistemmed <a href="shrub">shrub</a> tall. Both forms occur in the vicinity of <a href="Hill%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Hill River</a> but there is otherwise a marked demarcation.
In the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> and east of the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>, it is a stunted tree. Tree forms have a solid trunk, generally wavy or bent, with thick crumbly orange-grey <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> which is a red-brown underneath. It regenerates from fire via <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> or epicormic buds from its fire-tolerant trunk. It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves long and wide. The leaf margins have v- or u-shaped serrations along their length. The new growth is a pale grey-green, and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer, often after <a href="flower">flower</a>ing. The brilliant yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s (flower spikes) occur from spring into summer and are up wide and up to tall. They are made up of many small individual flowers; a study at <a href="Mount%20Adams%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Mount Adams</a> north of <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> revealed a count of 1933 (± a <a href="Standard%20error%20%28statistics%29">standard error</a> of 88) flowers per inflorescence, and another in the <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a> yielded a count of 1720 (± 76) flowers. <a href="Anthesis">Anthesis</a> proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days, and is asynchronous. That is, a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season.

Often bright green in <a href="bud">bud</a> stage, they are terminal, occurring at the ends of one- to three-year-old branches, and displayed prominently above the foliage. The smell of the open flowers has been likened to a peppery <a href="Syrah">Shiraz</a> wine. Over time, the spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the individual flowers shrivel and lie against the spikes. This coincides with the development of dark furry oval <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, which measure long, high, and wide. However, only a very small percentage (0.1%) of flowers develop into follicles; the field study at Mount Adams yielded a count of 3.6 ± 1.2 per cone. The follicles develop and mature over seven to eight months, from February to December, while <a href="seed">seed</a> development occurs over four months from September to December.

"Banksia attenuata" was first collected by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> from <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in December 1801, and published by him in 1810. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "attenuatus" "narrowed", and refers to the leaves narrowing towards the base. The species has had a fairly uneventful <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history. It has only two synonyms, and no <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> or <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> have been published; Australian botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> reviewed the variation in form in the species, and felt that the tree and shrub forms differed only in size and hence were not distinct enough to represent separate <a href="taxon">taxa</a>. In 1840, <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> published a putative new species, "Banksia cylindrostachya", in his "<a href="A%20Sketch%20of%20the%20Vegetation%20of%20the%20Swan%20River%20Colony">A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony</a>"; this has now be shown to be a <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a> of "B. attenuata". In 1891, <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> made a failed attempt to transfer "Banksia" to the new generic name "Sirmuellera". In the process he published the name "Sirmuellera attenuata", which is now considered a <a href="nomenclatural%20synonym">nomenclatural synonym</a> of "B. attenuata". <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include slender banksia, candle banksia and candlestick banksia. "Piara" (alternately spelled "biara") is an <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">aboriginal</a> name from the <a href="Melville%2C%20Western%20Australia">Melville</a> region of Perth.

The relationships of "Banksia attenuata" within the genus are unclear. When <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his infrageneric arrangement</a> of "Banksia" in 1856, he placed "B. attenuata" in section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Eubanksia">"Eubanksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>, a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous. This series was discarded in <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">the 1870 arrangement</a> of <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a>; instead, "B. attenuata" was placed in section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Cyrtostylis">"Cyrtostylis"</a>, a group of species which did not fit easily into one of the other sections.

In 1981, George published a revised arrangement that placed "B. attenuata" in the subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its flower spike, section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because its <a href="pistil">styles</a> are straight rather than hooked, and the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Cyrtostylis">"Cyrtostylis"</a>, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, and that it had similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member "<a href="Banksia%20elegans">B. elegans</a>". He felt "B. attenuata" to have affinities to "<a href="Banksia%20lindleyana">B. lindleyana</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20media">B. media</a>".

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published an <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arrangement</a> informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. They calculated "B. attenuata" to lie at the base of a large "B. attenuata" – "B.ashbyi" <a href="clade">clade</a>, but conceded further work was needed before its relationships could be determined, and left it as "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>" (i.e. Its exact placement is unclear.). Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of <a href="monograph">monograph</a>s. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement. The placement of "B. attenuata" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Banksiinae</a>, which then comprised genera "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia attenuata" resolves as a <a href="basal%20clade">basal</a> member of and next closest relative, or 'sister', to a clade containing "B. elegans" and, within that, a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> "B." subg. "Isostylis". An <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> fossil cone named "<a href="Banksia%20archaeocarpa">Banksia archaeocarpa</a>", around 50 million years old, resembles that of "B. attenuata".

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. attenuata" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

The most widely distributed of all western banksias, "Banksia attenuata" occurs across a broad swathe of <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, from <a href="Kalbarri%20National%20Park">Kalbarri National Park</a> and the <a href="Murchison%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Murchison River</a> (with an outlying population in <a href="Zuytdorp%20National%20Park">Zuytdorp National Park</a>) southwards right to the southwestern corner of the state at <a href="Augusta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Augusta</a> and <a href="Cape%20Leeuwin">Cape Leeuwin</a>, and then eastwards across the south to the western edge of <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a>. Along the eastern border northwards it is found at <a href="Lake%20Grace">Lake Grace</a>, <a href="Lake%20Magenta">Lake Magenta</a> north of <a href="Jerramungup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Jerramungup</a>, and the <a href="Wongan%20Hills">Wongan Hills</a>. It is restricted to various sandy soils, including white, yellow or brown sands, and sand over either <a href="laterite">laterite</a> or <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. It forms an important component of open "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" woodland as a dominant or <a href="understory">understory</a> tree or tall shrub. To the north, it is a shrubby component of <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>. It does not grow on heavy (clay-based) soils, and is hence only found in sandy pockets. Within open woodland, it is found alongside "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20ilicifolia">B. ilicifolia</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20prionotes">B. prionotes</a>", "<a href="Allocasuarina%20fraseriana">Allocasuarina fraseriana</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>", or "<a href="Eucalyptus%20gomphocephala">E. gomphocephala</a>". The annual rainfall within its distribution varies from .

Like many plants in <a href="south-west%20Western%20Australia">south-west Western Australia</a>, "B. attenuata" is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, "B. attenuata" is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.

It is moderately <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>, storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding "B. hookeriana" with which it coexists on sand dunes in scrub at <a href="Eneabba%2C%20Western%20Australia">Eneabba</a> north of Perth. Even then, many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire, but instead after successive autumn rains. An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of "Banksia attenuata" cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring <a href="Bunsen%20burner">Bunsen</a> flame to around for two minutes. Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time; around 40% released at three weeks, increasing steadily to almost 90% at ten weeks, compared with a series of <a href="scientific%20control">controls</a> (which were kept dry) of which fewer than 10% of seed released. Thus, the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (instead of dryer summer), increasing the chance of survival. After the follicle is split, the seed and <a href="seed%20separator">separator</a> are exposed to the elements. The wings of the woody separator are <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>, and move together when wet, and spread and curl apart when dry. The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting.

Once released, seed germinates at temperatures between to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival. Still, many seedlings die off in the hot and dry summer months. Seedling survival for the species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time. Despite this, the longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants. As they mature, plants are less likely to perish, and estimated to live for 300 years or more. Analyzing the seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on the Eneabba sandplain showed that "B. attenuata" would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20 years, peaking with intervals around 10 to 12 years, compared with longer intervals for the reseeders "B. hookeriana" and "B. prionotes". Placed against its rivals, "B. attenuata" would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11 years, but at longer intervals is outcompeted by "B. hookeriana". Variability in the timing between fires allows all three species to coexist. Exaggerated good and bad weather conditions favours "B. attenuata" over the reseeding species, which suffer more.

Despite having relatively heavy seed, seed from "Banksia attenuata" has a high rate of long distance dispersal. A genetic study of populations in Eneabba showed that over 5% of plants had originated up to away (similar rates to "Banksia hookeriana", the seed of which only weighs half as much). The mechanism for this is unclear, although <a href="Byron%20Lamont">Byron Lamont</a> has proposed the <a href="short-billed%20black%20cockatoo">short-billed black cockatoo</a> ("Calyptorhynchus latirostris") as a <a href="dispersal%20vector">vector</a>; the species seeks out "Banksia attenuata" cones after bushfire, possibly because the large seeds and greater chance of grubs in the cone make them more nutritious. Flowering has been recorded one to two years after a bushfire.

Flower spikes in late bud are used in the <a href="cut%20flower">cut flower</a> industry, primarily in Western Australia.

<a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> people, particularly the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the flower spike in a <a href="paperbark">paperbark</a>-lined hole filled with water to make a <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20sweet%20foods">sweet drink</a>. Both this species and "<a href="Banksia%20aemula">B. aemula</a>" have been credited with the inspiration behind <a href="May%20Gibbs">May Gibbs</a>' <a href="Snugglepot%20and%20Cuddlepie">Big Bad Banksia Men</a>; this species was familiar to Gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist <a href="Marianne%20North">Marianne North</a> produced a highly regarded painting of "B. attenuata" during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.

Ontario Highway 71

King's Highway 71, commonly referred to as Highway 71, is a <a href="Highways%20in%20Ontario">provincially maintained highway</a> in the <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. The route begins at the <a href="Fort%20Frances%E2%80%93International%20Falls%20International%20Bridge">Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge</a> in <a href="Fort%20Frances">Fort Frances</a>, continuing from <a href="U.S.%20Route%2053%20in%20Minnesota">US Route 53</a> (US 53) and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2071%20in%20Minnesota">US Route 71</a> (US 71) in <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, and travels west <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrently</a> with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2011">Highway 11</a> for to <a href="Chapple%2C%20Ontario">Chapple</a>. At that point, Highway 11 continues west while Highway 71 branches north and travels to a junction with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2017">Highway 17</a> just east of <a href="Kenora">Kenora</a>. Highway 71 is part of the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> for its entire length.

The current routing of Highway 71 was created out of a route renumbering that took place on April 1, 1960, to extend Highway 11 from <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a> to <a href="Rainy%20River%2C%20Ontario">Rainy River</a>. The portion of the highway that is concurrent with Highway 11 follows the Cloverleaf Trail, constructed by the end of 1880s and improved over the next several decades. The portion between Highway 11 and Highway 17 follows the Heenan Highway, constructed to connect the Rainy River region with Kenora and the remainder of Ontario's road network; before its opening, the area was accessible only from across the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">United States border</a>. Both highways were incorporated into the provincial highway system in 1937 following the merger of the <a href="Department%20of%20Highways">Department of Highways</a> (DHO) and the <a href="Department%20of%20Northern%20Development">Department of Northern Development</a>.

Highway 71 connects the Rainy River region with the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> near Kenora. The first of the highway traverses the largest pocket of <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> in <a href="northern%20Ontario">northern Ontario</a>. Following that, the route suddenly enters the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a>, where the land is unsuitable for agricultural development.

The highway begins at the international bridge in Fort Frances; within the United States, the road continues south as US 53 and US 71 in <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. From the bridge, it proceeds along Central Avenue, encountering Highway 11 one block north. The two routes travel north concurrently to 3 Street West, where both turn west. At the <a href="Fort%20Frances%20Cemetery">Fort Frances Cemetery</a>, the route branches southwest and exits Fort Frances after splitting with the Colonization Road (<a href="Ontario%20Highway%20602">Highway 602</a>). It follows the old Cloverleaf Trail west through <a href="Devlin%2C%20Ontario">Devlin</a>, where it intersects <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20613">Highway 613</a>, and <a href="Emo%2C%20Ontario">Emo</a>, where it merges with the Colonization Road. Approximately west of Emo, in the <a href="Rainy%20Lake%20and%20River%20Bands%20of%20Saulteaux">Manitou Rapids First Nations Reserve</a>, Highway 71 branches north, while Highway 11 continues west to <a href="Rainy%20River%2C%20Ontario">Rainy River</a>.

North of the Manitou Rapids Reserve, Highway 71 presses through a large swath of land mostly occupied by horse and cattle ranches. It intersects <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20600">Highway 600</a> and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20615">Highway 615</a>, both of which have historical connections to Highway 71. The highway passes through <a href="Finland%2C%20Ontario">Finland</a> and enters the <a href="Boreal%20Forest">Boreal Forest</a>, descending into the Canadian Shield over the course of a kilometre and a half (approximately one mile). From this point to its northern terminus, the highway crosses through rugged and isolated terrain, curving around lakes, rivers and mountains on its northward journey. It passes through the community of <a href="Caliper%20Lake%2C%20Ontario">Caliper Lake</a> before crossing between <a href="Rainy%20River%20District">Rainy River District</a> and <a href="Kenora%20District">Kenora District</a> midway between there and <a href="Nestor%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Nestor Falls</a>.
North of Nestor Falls, the highway travels along the eastern shore of <a href="Lake%20of%20the%20Woods">Lake of the Woods</a>, providing access to the community of Crow Lake on the <a href="Sabaskong%20Bay%2035D">Sabaskong Bay 35D</a> reserve of the <a href="Ojibways%20of%20Onigaming%20First%20Nation">Ojibways of Onigaming First Nation</a> between Lake of the Woods and <a href="Kakagi%20Lake">Kakagi Lake</a>, as well as to <a href="Whitefish%20Bay%2C%20Ontario">Whitefish Bay</a> just southeast of Sioux Narrows. Here the route crosses the <a href="Sioux%20Narrows%20Bridge">Sioux Narrows Bridge</a>, the last part of the highway to be constructed and a formidable engineering obstacle in the 1930s. North of Sioux Narrows, the highway meanders northward through an uninhabited region, zigzagging among the numerous lakes that dot Kenora District and crossing the <a href="Black%20River%20%28Kenora%20District%29">Black River</a>. It provides access to <a href="Eagle%20Dogtooth%20Provincial%20Park">Eagle Dogtooth</a> and <a href="Rushing%20River%20Provincial%20Park">Rushing River Provincial Park</a>s several kilometres south of its northern terminus at Highway 17, east of the split with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2017A">Highway 17A</a> and east of downtown Kenora.

Highway 71 was created out of a renumbering of several highways in the Rainy River District during the late 1950s as <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2011">Highway 11</a> was extended west of <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a>. The history of the route is tied to the two major highways in Rainy River District: the Cloverleaf Trail and the Heenan Highway.

The Cloverleaf Trail, the older of the two roads, was initially developed as the Rainy River colonization road. A line was blazed as early as 1875, possibly as part of the <a href="Dawson%20Road">Dawson Trail</a>, and improved in 1885 into a trail. This initial trail followed the <a href="Rainy%20River%20%28Minnesota%E2%80%93Ontario%29">Rainy River</a> west from Fort Frances to Lake of the Woods; <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20602">Highway 602</a> now follows the road between Fort Frances and Emo. In 1911, <a href="James%20Arthur%20Mathieu">James Arthur Mathieu</a> was elected as a <a href="Member%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament%20%28Ontario%29">Member of Provincial Parliament</a> (MPP) in the Rainy River riding. As a lumber merchant, Mathieu promoted improved road access in the region. Between 1911 and 1915, he oversaw construction of the <a href="gravel%20road">gravel</a> Cloverleaf Trail between Fort Frances and Rainy River.
The Heenan Highway would become the first Canadian link to the Rainy River area; before its opening in the mid-1930s, the only way to drive to the area was via the United States. In 1922, <a href="Kenora%20%28electoral%20district%29">Kenora</a> MPP <a href="Peter%20Heenan">Peter Heenan</a> and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to lobby for construction of a road between <a href="Nestor%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Nestor Falls</a> and Kenora.
Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in <a href="Mitch%20Hepburn">Mitch Hepburn</a>'s cabinet. This provided the impetus for construction to begin in 1934. Unlike the Cloverleaf Trail, the Fort Frances – Kenora Highway, as it was known prior to its opening, was constructed through the rugged terrain of the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a>. Rocks, forests, lakes, <a href="muskeg">muskeg</a>, and insects served as major hindrances during construction of the highway, which progressed from both ends. By late 1935, the only remaining gap in the road was the Sioux Narrows Bridge. Construction on this bridge was underway by March 1936; it was rapidly assembled using old-growth <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> from <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> (BC) as the main structural members. These timbers were cut in BC, and shipped to be built on-site like a jig-saw puzzle. The bridge was finished on June 15, 1936, completing the link between Fort Frances and Kenora.

On July 1, 1936, <a href="Premier%20of%20Ontario">Premier</a> Mitch Hepburn attended a ceremony in front of the Rainy Lake Hotel in Fort Frances. On a rainy afternoon, at 5:30 p.m., Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open. Hepburn, addressing the crowd that was gathered, asked "What would you say if we call it the Heenan Highway, what would you think of that?". The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon.

The Cloverleaf Trail and the Heenan Highway were assumed by the DHO shortly after its merger with the Department of Northern Development. Following the merger, the DHO began assigning trunk roads throughout northern Ontario as part of the provincial highway network. Highway 71 was assigned on September 1, 1937, along the Cloverleaf Trail. The portion of the Heenan Highway lying within Kenora District was designated as Highway 70 on the same day. The portion within Rainy River District was designated as Highway 70 on September 29.
The original route of Highway 70 split in two south of <a href="Finland%2C%20Ontario">Finland</a>; Highway 70 turned east to <a href="Off%20Lake%20Corner">Off Lake Corner</a>, then south to Emo, while Highway 70A turned west to <a href="Black%20Hawk%2C%20Ontario">Black Hawk</a> then south to <a href="Barwick%2C%20Ontario">Barwick</a>. The northern end of the highway was also concurrent with Highway 17 for into Kenora, and the southern end concurrent with Highway 71 for between Emo and Fort Frances. During 1952, the highway was extended south from its split to Highway 71, midway between Barwick and Emo. By 1953, the new road was opened and informally designated as the new route of Highway 70. The old routes were decommissioned on February 8, and the new route designated several weeks later on March 10, 1954. Both forks were later redesignated as Highway 600 and Highway 615.

Throughout the mid- to late 1950s, a new highway was constructed west from Thunder Bay towards Fort Frances. Initially this road was designated as <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20120">Highway 120</a>. In 1959, it was instead decided to make this new link a westward extension of Highway 11; a major renumbering took place on April 1, 1960: Highway 11 was established between Rainy River and Fort Frances, Highway 71 was truncated west of the Highway 70 junction, and the entirety of Highway 70 was renumbered as Highway 71. This established the current routing of the highway.

Although now rebuilt as a steel structure, the original Sioux Narrows Bridge was considered to be the longest single span wooden bridge in the world, at . The original bridge remained in place until 2003, when an engineering inspection revealed that 78% of the <a href="Structural%20integrity%20and%20failure">structure had failed</a>. A temporary bridge was erected while a new structure was built. The new bridge was completed in November 2007, incorporating the old timber <a href="truss%20bridge">truss</a> as a decorative element. A ribbon cutting ceremony to dedicate the bridge was held on July 1, 2008, 72 years after the original dedication by Mitch Hepburn.

The Royal National College for the Blind (RNC) is a <a href="Mixed-sex%20education">co-educational</a> specialist residential college of <a href="further%20education">further education</a> based in the English city of <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>. Students who attend the college are aged over 16 and <a href="blindness">blind</a> or partially sighted. They can study a wide range of qualifications at RNC, from academic subjects such as English and mathematics to more vocational topics such as performing arts. Alongside regular further education subjects and vocational training, the College offers training in mobility, independent living and personal development.

Founded in 1872 in London as the Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, the college had a number of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford; it was renamed the Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the education of visually impaired people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for visually impaired students in the United Kingdom to have been awarded <a href="Beacon%20Status">Beacon Status</a> in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning.

RNC hosts the UK's first VI Sports Academy, having begun as the home of the first football academy for visually impaired players and the England <a href="Paralympic%20association%20football">blind football</a> team. It hosted the <a href="2010%20IBSA%20World%20Blind%20Football%20Championship">2010 World Blind Football Championship</a> and also served as a training facility for participants in the <a href="2012%20Paralympic%20Games">2012 Paralympic Games</a>. The college is actively involved in the development of <a href="assistive%20technology">assistive technology</a>, including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in computer use. Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the <a href="Mountbatten%20Brailler">Mountbatten Brailler</a>, an electronic braille writer, and the <a href="Talking%20Tactile%20Tablet">T3</a>, a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.

Early in the 21st century, there was dramatic departmental restructuring at the college, and a significant redevelopment and modernisation of the Hereford campus. The campus, located on Venns Lane, Hereford, is home to RNC's teaching, residential and leisure facilities. Students live in halls of residence, which enable them to gain a level of independence within the college environment. RNC operates a leisure facility, thePoint4, which is open to the public, and conferencing and hotel accommodation under the name Gardner Hall.

The college is a registered charity (number 1000388), and its <a href="Patron%20%28charity%29">Patron</a> is <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>. There are several high-profile supporters, including Dave Clarke, former captain of the England and Great Britain blind football teams. RNC has a number of notable people among its alumni, including former Home Secretary <a href="David%20Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>. The college was the subject of a 2007 film for the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> "<a href="Cutting%20Edge%20%28Channel%204%20TV%20series%29">Cutting Edge</a>" documentary strand, which followed three students through their first term of study. The film won a 2008 <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> Award.

The college was established in 1871 by the English philanthropist <a href="Thomas%20Armitage">Thomas Rhodes Armitage</a> and the American anti-slavery campaigner <a href="Francis%20Joseph%20Campbell">Francis Joseph Campbell</a>, who lost his sight as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London would be a more suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.

With donations of £3,000, the college enrolled its first two students on 1 March 1872. <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> became its first Patron, while several prominent members of her family became Vice-Patrons. Among those to become governors of the College were <a href="Hugh%20Grosvenor%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Westminster">Duke of Westminster</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">Lord Shaftesbury</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Anson%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lichfield">Lord Lichfield</a> and the Right Hon. <a href="William%20Henry%20Smith%20%281825%E2%80%931891%29">W. H. Smith</a>, M.P. At the time of its founding it was called "The Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind", the word "<a href="Normal%20school">Normal</a>" being an <a href="American%20English">American expression</a> referring to teacher training offered by the college, with Campbell recruiting many of his teaching staff from the United States.

Originally located in two small buildings on Anerley Hill near London's <a href="Crystal%20Palace%2C%20London">Crystal Palace</a>, the college later moved to larger accommodation at Westow Street, <a href="Upper%20Norwood">Upper Norwood</a> after rapidly outgrowing its original premises. In its early days, the college was considered very progressive and experimental in its approach to education. A history of the college on its website describes the curriculum as "liberal and advanced for its day", and emphasis was placed on physical activities such as swimming, cycling and roller-skating. Students even took part in a morning of tobogganing following a heavy fall of snow. By the end of the 19th century, the college had over 200 students. Until the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the college admitted 11- to 15-year-olds, but in 1945 the principal of RNC and headmaster of <a href="New%20College%20Worcester">Worcester College for the Blind</a> came to an agreement that Worcester would provide secondary education and RNC would take students over the age of 16.

As well as being one of its founders, Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal, from 1871 until his retirement in 1912. He was knighted as a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> by <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> in 1909, for his services to blind people. He was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell, and following his death in 1929 Guy's widow, Louie Bealby Campbell took over the position. The role of principal passed outside the Campbell family for the first time upon Louie Bealby Campbell's retirement in 1934.

In the 20th century, the college moved location several times before establishing itself at its present campus in Hereford. The first of these moves occurred at the beginning of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when the college was evacuated from its London site and moved to a mansion named <a href="Great%20Maytham%20Hall">Great Maytham</a> in <a href="Rolvenden">Rolvenden</a> in west Kent. However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours notice and the help of the <a href="Royal%20London%20Society%20for%20the%20Blind">London Society for the Blind</a>, a temporary home was found for RNC in <a href="Dorton">Dorton</a>, near <a href="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.

The college did not return to London because the Upper Norwood site – which was being used as a hospital following RNC's move to Kent – was bombed in 1940 during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, then acquired by the authorities. The college had to close temporarily, until a permanent new home could be found, but in 1941 it purchased new premises at <a href="Rowton%20Castle">Rowton Castle</a> near <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> and relocated there. The castle was built in the 17th Century and is situated in of grounds six miles (10 km) west of Shrewsbury. This accommodation had limited space, and throughout its time in Shrewsbury RNC acquired other premises in and around the town. Albrighton Hall, about three miles (5 km) from Shrewsbury, was acquired in 1955 and adapted for residential and training purposes for male students, and Hardy House was obtained as a new residential area for female students in 1958. Plans to enlarge the Rowton site were seriously affected when, in 1953, fire destroyed much of the buildings and 38 pianos and organs. The alarm was raised by one of the students, and everybody present was evacuated to safety. Training was able to continue after Henshaw's Institution for the Blind took students and staff as a temporary measure.

RNC remained in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> for many years until, in 1978, more suitable accommodation was found that would enable RNC to consolidate its teaching and residential accommodation into one campus, and the college moved to its current home in Hereford. The site had previously been the campus of <a href="Hereford%20College%20of%20Education">Hereford College of Education</a>, a former teacher training college. In 1978 the college adopted its present name, the Royal National College for the Blind. RNC was opened at its new campus by <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, who arrived in Hereford by helicopter to perform the ceremony in 1979.

In the early 2000s the halls of residence at the Hereford campus underwent an extensive £1.5 million upgrade. The blocks were originally built when the campus was being used as a teacher training college during the 1960s and were updated to include modern facilities such as larger student bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and space for televisions and computers, and improved social areas.

In 2006 the college announced an extensive expansion of its campus, including new <a href="halls%20of%20residence">halls of residence</a>, a sports and <a href="complementary%20therapy">complementary therapy</a> building and a new outdoor floodlit sports pitch. The £21.5m sports development would be the venue for the <a href="2010%20IBSA%20World%20Blind%20Football%20Championship">2010 World Blind Football Championship</a>. A £10 million fundraising campaign, Building Brighter Futures, was created to raise the funds required to complete the project, and construction work began in the summer of 2007. The complex, thePoint4, was originally named The Point after a nearby block of flats. It includes a <a href="bistro">bistro</a> and conference facilities, and commenced operation in April 2009, and was officially opened on 24 June by <a href="BBC%20sport">BBC sport</a>s presenter and "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" columnist <a href="Des%20Kelly">Des Kelly</a>. In 2008 the college was nominated as one of the sites for the <a href="2012%20Paralympic%20Games">2012 Paralympic Games</a> and acted as a pre-Games training camp for Paralympic athletes.

RNC was the subject of a 2007 documentary for the <a href="Channel%20Four">Channel Four</a> series "<a href="Cutting%20Edge%20%28Channel%204%20TV%20series%29">Cutting Edge</a>", which followed three young students (Steve Markham, Daniel Angus and Selina Litt) during their first term at the college. The film examines their individual journeys towards greater independence as they encounter the unique challenges that being visually impaired presents, as well as how they deal with the everyday issues that affect all teenagers, such as sex, relationships, partying and their future plans after graduation. The documentary, "<a href="Blind%20Young%20Things">Blind Young Things</a>", was first aired on 30 April 2007, and won a <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> award for Channel Four and the Cutting Edge team in 2008.

In September 2009 the college became the permanent home of the National <a href="BlindArt">BlindArt</a> Collection, a collection of paintings, sculptures, installations and other works of art designed to engage all the senses and to provide people who are visually impaired with greater accessibility to art. In November 2009 RNC announced that it had been forced to send a third of its students home following an outbreak of <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">swine flu</a> on campus. During the <a href="Winter%20of%202009%E2%80%932010%20in%20Europe">heavy winter snowfall of 2009–2010</a> the college's sports facilities were utilised by the <a href="Hereford%20United%20F.C.">Hereford United</a> team for training after the bad weather conditions made using their own grounds at <a href="Edgar%20Street">Edgar Street</a> difficult.

In January 2010 two students from the college appeared with the <a href="Wardrobe%20stylist">fashion consultant</a> <a href="Gok%20Wan">Gok Wan</a> in an edition of the Channel 4 series "<a href="How%20to%20Look%20Good%20Naked">How to Look Good Naked...with a Difference</a>", where they took part in a photo shoot. The series sought to highlight confidence issues among people with disabilities. In February 2010 the college secured a £90,000 grant from the <a href="Learning%20and%20Skills%20Improvement%20Service">Learning and Skills Improvement Service</a> to install a music video production studio enabling bands to record material and showcase their work.

RNC celebrated its 140th anniversary in March 2012 with a day of events at its campus and a street collection in Hereford.

In the late 2000s RNC underwent significant restructuring as it responded to changes in the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students. However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest. There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college. Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told "In Touch", the <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> news programme for visually impaired listeners; "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us. And at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses but at the same time we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors." In an interview in January 2010, the then principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.

The changes led to significant department reorganisations within RNC, with several dozen staff members being summarily dismissed without explanation; some were replaced by volunteers. A number of former college employees made complaints regarding the manner in which their employment was ended. In July 2008 the college lecturers union, the <a href="University%20and%20College%20Union">University and College Union</a>, called for greater consultation between management and staff at the college. Speaking in a 2009 interview with "In Touch" Ian Pickford, who was brought in as interim principal following Christine Steadman's departure, claimed that the atmosphere of the college had changed and issued a challenge to any student or member of staff who was still unhappy to meet with him to discuss their concerns.

Financial concerns were raised in 2009 over the cost of the new leisure complex, and because of a change in the source of student funding from the <a href="Learning%20and%20Skills%20Council">Learning and Skills Council</a> to <a href="Local%20Education%20Authority">Local Education Authorities</a>. The college was facing a shortfall of at least £500,000 in 2009 and its auditors expressed doubt about RNC's ability to continue as a going concern. In response Ian Pickford said that much of thePoint4's costs had been paid for through donations and that the shortfall issue was being addressed through cutbacks, including some redundancies. Of the auditors' concerns he said; "I think post the banking crisis a lot of auditors are incredibly nervous about making bland statements in terms of the future of organisations and therefore they frequently now put those sort of caveats in to protect their position going forward."

The college is actively involved in the development and use of <a href="assistive%20technology">assistive technology</a> to aid <a href="visual%20impairment">visually impaired</a> people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the <a href="Talking%20Tactile%20Tablet">T3</a> (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 <a href="Hereford%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Hereford Museum and Art Gallery</a> became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally with the help of the <a href="UK%20Trade%20%26amp%3B%20Investment">UK Trade & Investment</a>'s passport initiative – a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.

The <a href="Mountbatten%20Brailler">Mountbatten</a>, an electronic <a href="Braille">Braille</a> writing machine and embosser, was pioneered and developed at the college by Ernest Bate. Work began on the project following a bequest in the will of the late <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a> for the development of
a modern, low cost, portable brailler. It has been available since 1991, and is manufactured by Quantum Technology, a company based in Australia. In the early 1990s two RNC lecturers, Clive Ellis and Tony Larkin, invented the <a href="Hoople%20%28mobility%20aid%29">Hoople</a>, a hoop-shaped mobility aid for blind people which performs a similar role to a <a href="white%20cane">white cane</a>, but is designed for use in a rural environment and on rough terrain. RNC lecturer Nigel Berry designed the Fingerprints Braille course, which was first published in 1993 and is now widely used to teach adult beginners to touch-read and write grade 2 Braille.

RNC is involved in the <a href="RoboBraille">RoboBraille</a> project which allows visually impaired Internet users to have text translated into Braille and MP3 audio format via email. The system, developed in Denmark, was launched in June 2006 and won a <a href="British%20Computer%20Society">British Computer Society</a> Social Contribution Project Award in 2007.
ClearText, which enables visually impaired users to browse the web more easily by making text easier for them to read, was developed in conjunction with the college. In 2009 RNC lecturer Tony Sales developed <a href="Vinux">Vinux</a>, an accessible version of the <a href="Linux">Linux</a> operating system for the visually impaired.

RNC provides full-time and shorter courses in vocational and academic subjects for approximately 200 students aged 16 and above. In 2008 there were 196 students in attendance, 74 of whom were aged 16 to 18 and 122 aged 19 years and over. Younger students often join the college straight from school, while adult students are from a diverse range of backgrounds. Students have often been visually impaired since birth or may have lost their sight in later life as a result of illness or accident. Some students have additional disabilities such as <a href="autistic%20spectrum%20disorder">autistic spectrum disorder</a>
and other medical needs. They can attend the college on a daily or residential basis, and accommodation is provided for those who board. There were 152 residential and 44 day students in 2008.

Courses vary in length from a few weeks to two years. There are no formal academic requirements for entry into RNC, but potential students are invited to attend an assessment at the college before being offered a place to determine the level of support they will need during their studies. The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and numeracy skills tests, and an interview with the leader of the course they wish to take.

Study programmes at RNC are designed to prepare visually impaired students for progression into further education, university or employment. The development of independent living and personal skills is also encouraged. The college is divided into several different areas of study. These include Leisure, Therapies and Sport (including courses and qualifications in <a href="massage">massage</a>, <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20therapy">complementary therapies</a>, and sport treatment and management); Music, Media, Performance and Art (including courses and qualifications in music technology, media and art); Information and Communication Technology (including courses and qualifications in office skills and the <a href="European%20Computer%20Driving%20Licence">European Computer Driving Licence</a>); Business, Administration and Customer Service; Secondary level qualifications – <a href="General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education">General Certificate of Secondary Education</a> (GCSE) and <a href="GCE%20Advanced%20Level">General Certificate of Education Advanced Level</a> (A-Level) qualifications in subjects such as English, mathematics, French and <a href="psychology">psychology</a>; and <a href="Braille">Braille</a> reading. On top of academic and vocational study students are also taught to develop independence and mobility skills for day-to-day living. Topics covered here include the use of a white cane and becoming familiar with the surrounding environment, using public transport safely and confidently, cooking and laundry skills, and using <a href="Automatic%20teller%20machine">cash machines</a> or making <a href="Chip%20and%20PIN">Chip and PIN</a> credit card transactions.

Traditionally courses in Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also available at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of a decline in the number of students studying the subjects. There has also been a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.

RNC began to offer its first Higher Education (or university level) qualification in January 2010 with the launch of the <a href="Certificate%20of%20Higher%20Education">Certificate in Higher Education</a>: Working with People with Visual Impairment Programme. The qualification is offered in collaboration with St Joseph's Centre for the Visually Impaired in Dublin and the <a href="University%20of%20Worcester">University of Worcester</a>.

Following an inspection by the <a href="Ofsted">Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills</a> (Ofsted) in 2004 the quality of the college's teaching was graded as "outstanding", and in 2005 RNC was one of only eight colleges in the UK to be awarded <a href="Beacon%20Status">Learning and Skills Beacon Status</a>. It is the only college for visually impaired students to have Beacon status, which is only given to educational establishments which have received a first-class Ofsted inspection report. RNC was again praised by Ofsted in 2009 for its continued good progress when Inspectors graded the college as "outstanding" across all six areas inspected and said it had gained ground since its last inspection in 2006.

RNC has four halls of residence, three of which (Armitage, Campbell and Dowdell) have been updated in recent years to include modern facilities in accordance with <a href="Care%20Standards%20Act%202000">Care Standards</a> and <a href="Disability%20Discrimination%20Act%201995">Disability Discrimination Act</a> requirements. Specific accommodation has been adapted for wheelchair users, while some rooms have sensory fire alarm calls to alert those who are hard of hearing. Halls are divided into flats accommodating several students. Each flat has a number of single rooms with shared kitchen and dining facilities, and a central lounge.

Because it was not possible to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, was built to replace it. Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.

On-campus facilities include a gym, sports hall, a floodlit all-weather football pitch and tennis courts. RNC's thePoint4 complex offers sporting, leisure and conference facilities, as well as a bistro, and is open to both students and members of the general public. Other facilities at RNC include the <a href="Flexible%20learning">Flexible Learning Centre</a>, which features the latest assistive technology and learning resources and is open seven days a week, a student social club which is <a href="Liquor%20license">licensed</a> to sell alcohol to students who are 18 and over, and a student common room. The college has an active <a href="Student%20unionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Students' Union</a> which plays an important role in college life, being responsible for organising leisure activities both on and off campus. There are also on-campus medical facilities.

In December 2008 the "Hereford Times" reported that the college would be home to a sculpture by the Herefordshire-based contemporary artist <a href="Walenty%20Pytel">Walenty Pytel</a> that he would create using an original drawing produced by an RNC student. The piece, depicting a man running in a <a href="Futurism">Futurist</a> style and titled the "4Runner" was unveiled in September 2009 and stands on a plinth outside the entrance of the sports and leisure complex.

RNC is the home of the first <a href="Association%20football">football</a> academy for visually impaired players. The Football Academy was officially opened in August 2008 by former England footballer <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Sir Trevor Brooking</a> and offers visually impaired students the opportunity to include football as part of their study programme with a view to playing the game at a national level. The college is the home of the England <a href="blind%20football">blind football</a> team, which is supported by <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> and coached by former professional footballer <a href="Tony%20Larkin">Tony Larkin</a>. The game is played as a five-a-side match using a ball filled with ballbearings to enable players to hear its position. Teams consist of four blind players and a sighted goalkeeper who offers directions along with the coach and a sighted guide behind the opposition goalpost. RNC is helping to develop a national blind football league. In 2010 RNC hosted the World Blind Football Championship at its campus. The tournament got under way on Saturday 14 August with the opening match between England and Spain, and was won by Brazil following a 2–0 win against Spain in the final on 22 August. Members of England's blind football team travelled to Los Angeles in November 2011 to promote the sport in the United States, and took part in a day's training with former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> captain <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>. The trip was organised by supermarket chain <a href="Sainsbury%27s">Sainsbury's</a> as part of their sponsorship deal with the footballer.

<a href="Blind%20cricket">Blind cricket</a>, which is played basically the same as conventional cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so that players may see it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the <a href="British%20Blind%20Sport">British Blind Sport</a> (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses <a href="air%20rifle">air rifle</a>s fitted with <a href="Photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric cells</a> which convert light reflected from targets into sound.

As well as football, cricket and acoustic shooting, students at RNC can participate in a wide range of other sporting and athletic activities, including horse riding, swimming, <a href="ten%20pin%20bowling">ten pin bowling</a>, <a href="weight%20training">weight training</a>, <a href="circuit%20training">circuit training</a> and martial arts. Away from sport, other activities include art and design, ceramics, drama and dance, photography and gardening. There are shopping excursions and trips to the cinema and theatre, while clubs and societies include a <a href="dining%20club">dining club</a> and the RNC choir.

The college is a charitable organisation and is registered with the <a href="Charity%20Commission">Charity Commission</a>, the government body which oversees charities in England and Wales. It has a number of high-profile supporters which include <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, who is the current <a href="Patron%20%28charity%29">Patron</a>, a position he has held since 1997. The current president is Mrs Jessica White, and there are several public figures who serve as vice presidents. These include the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Westminster">Archbishop of Westminster</a>, <a href="Penelope%20Knatchbull%2C%20Countess%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Countess Mountbatten of Burma</a> and <a href="Michael%20Buerk">Michael Buerk</a>. In 2008 the BBC sports presenter <a href="Gabby%20Logan">Gabby Logan</a> and Daily Mail columnist Des Kelly both became Patrons of the England Blind Football team.

Since the Principalship passed outside the Campbell family in 1934 a number of individuals have held the position. Among them are Lance Marshall who was principal at the time the college moved to its Hereford campus in 1978, followed by Colin Housby-Smith and then Roisin Burge. Christine Steadman oversaw the college's restructuring during her tenure in the late 2000s and proved to be unpopular with staff and students; Steadman resigned in November 2008. Geoff Draper, a former <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Colonel</a> in the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Army</a>, was appointed to the position on 7 December 2009. Sheila Tallon succeeded Draper in September 2011. Mark Fisher took over from Tallon after her retirement in December 2015.

Graduates of the college include <a href="David%20Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>, <a href="British%20Labour%20Party">British Labour Party</a> politician and former <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20Hollins">Alfred Hollins</a>, English composer and organist. Giles McKinley, who starred in a groundbreaking television commercial for <a href="Sauza%20Tequila">Sauza Tequila</a> during the 1990s, is a former RNC student. The actor <a href="Ryan%20Kelly%20%28actor%29">Ryan Kelly</a>, who in 1997, became the first completely blind student to join the <a href="Bristol%20Old%20Vic%20Theatre%20School">Bristol Old Vic Theatre School</a>, and plays the role of Jack "Jazzer" McCreary in <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="The%20Archers">The Archers</a>", attended RNC.

Jesus College Boat Club (Oxford)

Jesus College Boat Club (commonly abbreviated to JCBC) is a <a href="rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a> club for members of <a href="Jesus%20College%2C%20Oxford">Jesus College, Oxford</a>, one of the <a href="Colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford">constituent colleges</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. The club was formed in 1835, but rowing at the college predates the club's foundation: a boat from the college was involved in the earliest recorded races between college crews at Oxford in 1815, when it competed against <a href="Brasenose%20College%20Boat%20Club">Brasenose College</a>. In the early years of rowing at Oxford, Jesus was one of the few colleges that participated in races. Neither the men's nor the women's <a href="Eight%20%28rowing%29">1st VIIIs</a> have earned the title of "<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">Head of the River</a>", which is gained by winning <a href="Eights%20Week">Eights Week</a>—the main inter-college rowing competition at Oxford.

A number of college members have rowed for the university against <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> in the <a href="Boat%20Race">Boat Race</a> and the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Women's Boat Race</a>. <a href="Barney%20Williams">Barney Williams</a>, a Canadian rower who studied at the college, won a silver medal in <a href="rowing%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a>, and participated in the Boat Race in 2005 and 2006. Other students who rowed while at the college have achieved success in other fields, including <a href="John%20Sankey">John Sankey</a>, who became <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Alwyn%20Williams%20%28bishop%29">Alwyn Williams</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, and <a href="Maurice%20Jones">Maurice Jones</a>, who became Principal of <a href="St%20David%27s%20College%2C%20Lampeter">St David's College, Lampeter</a>. Another college rower, <a href="James%20Page%20%28rower%29">James Page</a>, was appointed Secretary of the <a href="Amateur%20Rowing%20Association">Amateur Rowing Association</a> and coached both the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club">Cambridge</a> University boat clubs.

The college <a href="boathouse">boathouse</a>, which is shared with the boat club of <a href="Keble%20College%2C%20Oxford">Keble College</a>, is in <a href="Christ%20Church%20Meadow">Christ Church Meadow</a>, on the <a href="The%20Isis">Isis</a> (as the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> is called in Oxford). It dates from 1964 and replaced a moored <a href="barge">barge</a> used by spectators and crew-members. The last college barge had been purchased from one of the <a href="Livery%20Companies">Livery Companies</a> of the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> in 1911. It is now a <a href="floating%20restaurant">floating restaurant</a> further down the Thames at <a href="Richmond-upon-Thames">Richmond</a>, and for some years was painted in the college colours of green and white.

The early records of the club have been lost, but there are references to a Jesus College boat in material that survives from the early 19th century. There are references to "pleasure boating" at Oxford in letters and poems written in the late 18th century, but races between crews from different colleges did not start until the early 19th century. Rowing in eights (boats with eight oarsmen, each pulling one oar, and steered by a <a href="coxswain">coxswain</a>) began at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, where there is a record of the school owning three eights by 1811, and then progressed to Oxford. The first record of an inter-college race, between eights from Jesus College and <a href="Brasenose%20College%20Boat%20Club">Brasenose College</a>, dates from 1815. These may have been the only two colleges who had boats racing at that time, and the Brasenose boat was usually victorious. There were few rowers, and races between fours (boats with four oarsmen and a coxswain) tended to attract more interest than races between eights. Students would row to the inn at <a href="Sandford-on-Thames">Sandford-on-Thames</a>, a few miles south of Oxford, and race each other on the way back. The races would start at <a href="Iffley%20Lock">Iffley Lock</a> and finish at King's Barge, off <a href="Christ%20Church%20Meadow">Christ Church Meadow</a>. Flags hoisted on the barge would indicate the finishing order of the crews. Crews would set off one behind the other, the trailing boat(s) trying to catch, or "<a href="bump%20%28rowing%29">bump</a>", the boat ahead. The bumped boat and the bumping boat would then drop out and the bumping boat would start the next day's race ahead of the bumped boat. The aim was to become the lead boat, known as <a href="Bumps%20race">Head of the River</a>. For identification, crews wore college colours and emblazoned the <a href="rudder">rudder</a> of the boat with the college coat of arms. Crews from Jesus College painted <a href="leek">leek</a>s (an <a href="Symbols%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20the%20Channel%20Islands%20and%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man">emblem of Wales</a>) on their oars for further distinction. In early races, some rowers wore high hats while others, including the Jesus crews, wore <a href="Tam%20o%27shanter%20%28hat%29">Tam o'shanters</a> in college colours (green with a white band for Jesus); crews from Jesus College wore these until at least 1847.

In 1822, crews from Jesus and Brasenose raced each other to become Head of the River. One Brasenose rower apparently "<a href="Glossary%20of%20rowing%20terms%23The%20stroke">caught a crab</a>", slowing the boat. The Brasenose boat was bumped by the Jesus boat, but rowed on regardless and claimed that it was still Head of the River. Jesus and Brasenose men competed over which college's flag should be hoisted to denote the winning boat. One of the Brasenose crew ended the dispute by saying ""Quot homines tot sententiae", different men have different opinions, some like leeks and some like onions", referring to the emblem on the Jesus oars, and it was agreed to row the race again. The Brasenose crew won the rematch. The incident has been said to be shown in an 1822 picture, the earliest depiction of an eights race at Oxford, painted by I. T. Serres (Marine Painter to <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a>). However, the print was published on 1 March 1822 and it would have taken several months to prepare and engrave. It also shows a summer scene. Both of these points suggest that the print depicts either an imaginary scene or an unrecorded event from 1821.
Races gradually became more formalised, and regulations were introduced prohibiting colleges from using professional rowers or members of other colleges. A race for the colleges' second boats (<a href="Torpids">Torpids</a>) was introduced in 1826, and eventually boats with less than eight oars were excluded from the races. During the late 1820s and early 1830s, Jesus did not take part in races, but the college was mentioned as having a second boat by 1836. The formal foundation of the club dates from 1835, and official records of inter-college races begin in 1837. The Jesus College 1st VIII started the competition that year in second position, behind the <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a> 1st VIII, but after being bumped on successive nights by <a href="Exeter%20College%2C%20Oxford">Exeter</a>, <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol</a> and <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">Queen's</a> colleges, Jesus took no further part in that year's competition. In 1838, the Jesus College boat rowed in last place on one evening, but did not participate in the races again until 1844. The club's fortunes varied in the years thereafter. In 1859, the eight achieved an unusual "<a href="overbump">overbump</a>" (catching the crew that had started three places ahead of them, after the boat immediately ahead of it had bumped the boat it was chasing) and so went up three positions in one race. However, the college boat did not compete in 1860 and it finished in last place in 1864. From 1864 onwards, said <a href="Ernest%20George%20Hardy">Ernest Hardy</a> (in his 1899 history of the college), "the boating record of the College has not been good" – the college did not take part in the races in many years, and it seldom improved its position by more than one or two places when it did participate. The college resumed regular participation in the races in 1882; although it was in last place in 1889, the college improved its position, and went up by nine places between 1894 and 1896. Hardy also commented that the 1896 Jesus College boat had a reputation of being one of the faster boats in the university. The crew entered for the <a href="Ladies%27%20Challenge%20Plate">Ladies' Challenge Plate</a> at the <a href="Henley%20Regatta">Henley Regatta</a>, but lost to Eton, the eventual winners.
By 1930, the college 1st VIII had reached its highest position on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain <a href="Leslie%20Cross">Leslie Cross</a> presented a new set of oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.

Women were first admitted to Jesus College in 1974; the college was one of the first five men's colleges to do so. The women's 1st VIII was Head of the River in Torpids between 1980 and 1983. In 1993, the women's 1st VIII <a href="bumps%20race">won their "blades"</a> in the first divisions of both Torpids and <a href="Eights%20Week">Eights Week</a>, an achievement that led to the crew being described in the "Jesus College Record" as vying "not just for the College team of the decade, but perhaps for the team of the last three decades", in any sport. The same crew also won the Novices' Trophy at the <a href="Wallingford%20Regatta">Wallingford Regatta</a> in the same year. The women's 1st VIII has not maintained its position since then. After some years in the third division, it ended the 2011 Eights Week in twelfth place in the second division, winning blades in the process.

All members of the college who have coxed or rowed in a JCBC boat are Ordinary Members of the Boat Club, a status that they retain until one month after leaving the college. The club is run by a committee, consisting of a President, the Men's and Women's Captains of Boats, Men's and Women's Vice-Captains of Boats, Captain of Coxes, Treasurer, Secretary, Boathouse Safety Officer, Kit Officer, and two Social Secretaries. Members of the committee hold office for one year, starting on Sunday of the sixth week of <a href="Trinity%20Term">Trinity Term</a> – the day after the last day of Eights Week. The Senior Member of the club is Peter Mirfield, a <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">Fellow</a> and Tutor in Law at the college.

The college uses a proportion of student fees to fund social and sporting activity. The allocation for sport, including rowing, is overseen by the Committee of Amalgamated Clubs, which has representatives from the <a href="Common%20Room%20%28university%29">Junior and Middle Common Rooms</a> (for undergraduates and postgraduates) as well as from the college's sport clubs.

<a href="Old%20Member">Old Member</a>s of the college who rowed when they were students can join the Cadwallader Club. The club, which was revitalised in 1974 and organises an annual dinner for members, also receives contributions for the Cadwallader Trust; this has been a <a href="registered%20charity">registered charity</a> since December 1982 and supports rowing at the college both with capital expenditure and training costs. In the year ending 5 April 2008, the trust's expenditure was £19,001. Members of the Cadwallader Club have helped to provide new boats and blades for the men's and the women's 1st VIIIs, and on the Saturday of Eights Week 2008, the trust presented the boat club with a new coxed four, named "Cadwallader". Cadwallader Club members are also non-voting members of the boat club.

D. W. Griffith, the <a href="Boat%20positions%20%28sport%20rowing%29">stroke</a> of the Jesus College boat, was present at the inaugural meeting of the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford University Boat Club</a> on 23 April 1839. However, Jesus College oarsmen played an infrequent part in university rowing in the 19th century. No Jesus College student served on the OUBC committee between 1839 and 1899, the last year for which Sherwood gives records. Two students from the college (W. S. Thompson and E. W. Davies (cox)) were part of the losing Oxford crew in the second <a href="The%20Boat%20Race">Oxford–Cambridge boat race</a> in 1836. Between 1858 and 1899, seven others trialled, unsuccessfully, for places in the Oxford University crew. Since then, college representation in the Boat Race has been more frequent: M. L. Thomas and D. R. Glynne Jones (1952) and M.L. Thomas (President, 1953); Boris Mavra (1992, 1993 and 1995); the Canadian <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202004%20Olympics">2004 Olympic rowing</a> silver medallist <a href="Barney%20Williams">Barney Williams</a> (2005 and 2006); and Brodie Buckland (2007). Justin Hutchinson rowed for Oxford's reserve crew, known as Isis, in the 2002 and 2003 Boat Races, as did Tim Farquharson, an undergraduate studying Engineering Science, in 2009. Various women have won their "<a href="Oxford%20Blue">Blue</a>" for competing in the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Women's Boat Race</a> against <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge</a>: Anna Bean and Ann Bevitt (1989); Louise Sanford (1997); and Claire Weaver (1998).

Some prominent individuals rowed while they were students at the college. The historian <a href="Albert%20Pollard">Albert Pollard</a> was Captain of Boats in 1890, having rowed in the boat that was last on the river in 1889. <a href="Alwyn%20Williams%20%28bishop%29">Alwyn Williams</a> (later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>), who was a student from 1906 to 1911, was captain of the Boat Club, as was <a href="James%20Page%20%28rower%29">James Page</a> ("Freddie"), who went on to become secretary of the <a href="Amateur%20Rowing%20Association">Amateur Rowing Association</a> from 1952 to 1972 and a rowing coach for both Oxford and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club">Cambridge Boat Clubs</a>. <a href="Maurice%20Jones">Maurice Jones</a> (later Principal of <a href="University%20of%20Wales%2C%20Lampeter">St David's College</a>, <a href="Lampeter">Lampeter</a>) was a cox, as were <a href="Gordon%20Roe">Gordon Roe</a> (later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Huntingdon">Bishop of Huntingdon</a>) and the chemist <a href="Frank%20Greenaway">Frank Greenaway</a>. <a href="John%20Sankey">John Sankey</a> (later <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>) rowed in a Torpid boat that went down four places, whilst the boat in which the baritone <a href="David%20Ffrangcon%20Davies">David Ffrangcon Davies</a> rowed went up five places in Torpids and four in Eights Week. <a href="Angus%20Buchanan%20%28VC%29">Angus Buchanan</a>, who won the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> in 1916 during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, rowed in a college four in 1919, despite having been blinded in 1917. <a href="Anton%20Muttukumaru">Anton Muttukumaru</a> (later <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29">Commander of the Ceylon Army</a>) rowed at <a href="Boat%20positions%20%28sport%20rowing%29">bow</a> in a college four.

Colleges began to keep <a href="barge">barge</a>s moored on the side of the river on Christ Church Meadow from 1839; these would be used for crews to change, for spectators to watch the races and for social functions. Jesus shared a barge with <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New</a>, <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St John's</a> and <a href="Pembroke%20College%20Boat%20Club%20%28Oxford%29">Pembroke</a> after 1857. In 1911, Jesus purchased their own barge from <a href="Salters%20Steamers">Salters</a>, at a cost of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>940.14<a href="Shilling%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">s</a>.8<a href="British%20one%20penny%20coin%20%28pre-decimal%29">d</a> (approximately £ as of 2019). It had previously been owned by one of the <a href="Livery%20Companies">Livery Companies</a> of the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> and had been used in the days when the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%27s%20Show">Lord Mayor's Show</a> took place on the River Thames in London rather than through the streets. After sinking in 1955, it was salvaged and restored. In 1964, the college replaced the barge with a <a href="boathouse">boathouse</a>, which is shared with the boat club of <a href="Keble%20College%2C%20Oxford">Keble College</a>). The barge was moved to <a href="Maidenhead">Maidenhead</a> where it was later restored. It returned to Oxford in 1987, but was badly damaged by fire in January 1988. After further restoration, it was moved to <a href="Richmond-upon-Thames">Richmond-upon-Thames</a>, where it is moored alongside <a href="Richmond%20Bridge%2C%20London">Richmond Bridge</a> and used as a restaurant. The barge was decorated for some years in the college colours of green and white, with a <a href="Welsh%20Dragon">Welsh red dragon</a> on the prow; by 2009, however, it had been repainted with blue instead of green.

Big Two-Hearted River

"Big Two-Hearted River" is a two-part short story written by American author <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, published in the 1925 <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> edition of "<a href="In%20Our%20Time%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">In Our Time</a>", the first American volume of Hemingway's short stories. It features a single <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, Hemingway's recurrent autobiographical character <a href="Nick%20Adams%20%28character%29">Nick Adams</a>, whose speaking voice is heard just three times. The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature. When it was published, critics praised Hemingway's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>.

The story is one of Hemingway's earliest pieces to employ his <a href="Iceberg%20Theory">Iceberg Theory</a> of writing; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at, rather than explicitly stated. "Big Two-Hearted River" is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot. Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>'s paintings and adapted the painter's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image. In this story, the small details of a fishing trip are explored in great depth, while the landscape setting, and most obviously the swamp, are given cursory attention.

In 1922, Hemingway moved with his wife <a href="Hadley%20Richardson">Hadley</a> to Paris, where he worked as foreign correspondent for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>". He became friends with and was influenced by <a href="Modernist%20literature">modernist</a> writers such as <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> and <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled "<a href="Three%20Stories%20and%20Ten%20Poems">Three Stories and Ten Poems</a>", followed the next year by another collection of short <a href="Vignette%20%28literature%29">vignettes</a>, "<a href="In%20Our%20Time%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">in our time</a>" (without capitals). Hoping to have "in our time" published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with "Big Two-Hearted River" planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal "<a href="the%20transatlantic%20review">the transatlantic review</a>".
"Big Two-Hearted River" has strong autobiographical elements. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Hemingway signed on as a member of the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> at age 19, and was sent to the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian Front</a> at <a href="Fossalta%20di%20Piave">Fossalta</a> as an ambulance driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Afternoon">Death in the Afternoon</a>": "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments". A few days later, on July 8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near <a href="Seney%2C%20Michigan">Seney</a> in Michigan's <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>—a trip that became the inspiration for "Big Two-Hearted River". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed—leaving Nick alone in the woods.

When Hemingway asked her opinion of the draft in October 1925, Stein advised him to cut an 11-page section of stream-of-consciousness reminiscences written from Nick's point of view. Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: "I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap". Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a "tour-de-force" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development. 

In January 1925, while wintering in <a href="Schruns">Schruns</a>, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine "This Quarter". Walsh bought it for 1,000 <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a>s, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of "In Our Time" (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part "Big Two-Hearted River". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Column%20and%20the%20First%20Forty-Nine%20Stories">The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</a>" published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, "<a href="The%20Nick%20Adams%20Stories%20%28book%29">The Nick Adams Stories</a>" (1972) and "<a href="The%20Complete%20Short%20Stories%20of%20Ernest%20Hemingway">The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition</a>" (1987). The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled "<a href="On%20Writing%20%28Hemingway%29">On Writing</a>" in 1972 in "<a href="The%20Nick%20Adams%20Stories">The Nick Adams Stories</a>".

Part one

The story opens with Nick arriving by train at <a href="Seney%2C%20Michigan">Seney, Michigan</a>, to find that a fire has devastated the town, leaving "nothing but the rails and the burned-over country." While following a road leading away from the town, he stops on a bridge where he observes <a href="trout">trout</a> in the river below. After, he hikes up a hill and rests at a burned stump. While smoking a cigarette, he discovers an ash-blackened grasshopper crawling on his sock, and detaches it. His first spoken words in the story are "Go on, hopper ... Fly away somewhere."

Later in the day he relaxes in a glade of tall pines and falls asleep. When he wakes, he hikes the last mile to the edge of the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light "making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain." He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats a pot of coffee, and kills a mosquito before falling asleep.

Part two

Early the next morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s found under a log he names a "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee and makes a sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a> rod and tying on damp <a href="Fishing%20line">leader line</a>, he walks to the river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.

Hemingway saw World War I as the "central fact of our time". "Big Two-Hearted River" hints at both widespread physical devastation and Nick's personal war and post-war experience, but neither of these central facts are directly mentioned. Hemingway scholar Joseph Flora makes the observation that Hemingway portrays Nick's character coping "more meaningfully than he had ever done before, with the issues of life and death". Biographer Phillip Young sees the story as basically concerned with a description of a young man "trying desperately to keep from going out of his mind." Nick returns wounded, and introduces a character type Hemingway used again in his later stories and novels. The theme of an unspecified wound is introduced, a device that was to culminate in Jake Barnes' character in "<a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises">The Sun Also Rises</a>". Hemingway scholar William Adair suggests that Nick's war experience was different, and perhaps more traumatic than Hemingway's own, writing that Nick's unspecified wound should not be confused or automatically identified with Hemingway's wound.

Although Hemingway's best fiction such as "Big Two-Hearted River" perhaps originated from the "dark thoughts" about the wounding, Jackson Benson believes that autobiographical details are employed as <a href="framing%20device">framing device</a>s to make observations on life in general and not just Nick's own experiences. He writes that Hemingway created "what if" scenarios from real situations in his early fiction, which he projected onto a fictional character—"What if I were wounded and made crazy?" the character asks himself. Benson goes on to write that "much of Hemingway's fiction is dream-like—his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare, as in the recurring imagery of "In Our Time"."

Adair views the river setting as a fictional representation of the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave River</a> near Fossalta, the site of Hemingway's mortar wound. Hemingway may have taken the idea of the swamp from the terrain in the battle of Portogrande—a battle that Hemingway wrote about in a 1922 newspaper story, saying of it: "Austrians and Italians attacked and counter-attacked waist deep in swamp water". Furthermore, Adair suggests that Hemingway's own wounding is reflected in the scene where Nick loses a fish—the "biggest one I ever had"—with descriptive imagery such as shoes "squelchy" with water, suggestive of Hemingway's recollection of "feeling as if his boots were filled with warm water (blood) after his wounding."

Writing in "<a href="A%20Moveable%20Feast">A Moveable Feast</a>", Hemingway remembered "Big Two-Hearted River", recalling when he "sat in a corner with the afternoon light coming in over my shoulder and wrote in the notebook ... When I stopped writing I did not want to leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but there was no mention of the war in it."

Hemingway's stories typically position nature as a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's <a href="existentialism">existential</a> moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In "Big Two-Hearted River", Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's "<a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a>" in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well for the first time since the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.

Hemingway's descriptions of the Michigan landscape, which would have been familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family's <a href="Walloon%20Lake">Walloon Lake</a> cottage in <a href="Northern%20Michigan">Northern Michigan</a>, are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner. Ronald Berman sees Hemingway's treatment of landscape as like a painter's canvas on which he presents Nick's state of mind. The descriptions of the river's water have been compared to American <a href="Transcendentalism">transcendentalist</a> writer <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>'s descriptions of the <a href="Walden%20Pond">pond</a> in "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>". Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication; Nick evidences a sense of loss which is "not simply grace under pressure—but under siege". Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad—a pervasive theme in American literature, found in such American classics as <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s 19th-century "<a href="Huckleberry%20Finn">Huckleberry Finn</a>" and in <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>'s 20th-century "<a href="Go%20Down%2C%20Moses%20%28book%29">Go Down, Moses</a>".

According to Hemingway scholar Susan Beegel, Hemingway is fundamentally an American nature writer. She attributes it to his upbringing: his mother, <a href="Grace%20Hall%20Hemingway">Grace Hemingway</a>, believed avidly in the early 20th-century "back to nature" movement, and his father was a physician who taught science to his son, taking him to <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Agassiz Movement</a> meetings as a young boy. Hemingway's affinity with nature is reflected most strongly in "Big Two-Hearted River", in broad strokes whereby he has Nick traveling deep into the American back-country to find solace, and in small details such as his Agassiz "object oriented" descriptions of the grasshoppers.

Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of <a href="imagism">imagism</a> to his own work. Pound's influence can be seen in the stripped-down, minimalist style characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound "taught [me] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer <a href="Carlos%20Baker">Carlos Baker</a> writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to "get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his <a href="iceberg%20theory">iceberg theory</a>: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.

The iceberg theory has been termed the "theory of omission". Hemingway believed a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different. In "Big Two-Hearted River" he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out. The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break.

While Hemingway painstakingly describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely hints at the driving force of the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war ... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted." Flora believes that in "Big Two-Hearted River" the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway.

Paul Smith believes Hemingway was still only experimenting stylistically during "In Our Time". He maintains that Hemingway's later minimalist style can be seen here, but not so much from tight editing as from Hemingway's first approach, his desire to emulate his influences. Hemingway's sentences "began life as scrawny little things, and then grew to their proper size through a process of accretion." He avoided complicated syntax to reflect Nick's wish that the fishing trip be uncomplicated. An analysis of the text shows that about 70 percent of the sentences are <a href="simple%20sentence">simple sentence</a>s—a childlike syntax without <a href="subordinate%20clause">subordination</a>—and that <a href="Repetition%20%28rhetorical%20device%29">repetition</a> is often substituted for subordinate thoughts. Furthermore, the repetition creates prose with a "rhythmic, ritualistic effect" that emphasizes important points. The lengths of the paragraphs vary with short paragraphs intensifying the action. Benson writes that in "<a href="Indian%20Camp">Indian Camp</a>" and "Big Two-Hearted River" Hemingway's prose was sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and that by employing simple sentences and diction—techniques he learned writing for newspapers—the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality.

Hemingway greatly admired <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a> and early in his career crafted his prose in a way that would resonate with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters ... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how ... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." Hemingway wanted the structure of "Big Two-Hearted River" to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, "I have finished two long stories ... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".

His description of the river and the countryside betray the influence of the <a href="Post-Impressionism">Post-Impressionist</a> style. Hemingway was heavily influenced by the <a href="modernists">modernists</a>. He often visited the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Luxembourg">Musée du Luxembourg</a>, where he saw three Cézanne paintings, "<a href="L%27Estaque%2C%20Melting%20Snow">L'Estaque</a>", "<a href="Cour%20d%27une%20ferme">Cour d'une ferme</a>", and "<a href="Les%20Peupliers">Les Peupliers</a>". A series of Cézanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story. Hemingway wrote in "A Moveable Feast" that he had been "learning something from the painting of Cézanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them."
Comparing "Big Two-Hearted River" to Cézanne's paintings, Berman observes that Hemingway established a "representation of form, space and light", and that the dense descriptive passages give "light and form ... overwhelmingly visual, intensely concerned with spatiality", while in the middle ground, "We sense [the trees] through vertical forms and dark colors only". Like Cézanne paintings, Hemingway's landscapes are vague and do not represent any specific place: Seney burned in 1891, not in 1919; the hill Nick climbs does not exist; and the east branch of the <a href="Fox%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Fox River</a>, where he camps, is not a day's hike from the town.

Kenneth Johnston believes Hemingway's use of symbolism is a substitute for paint and brushstrokes. He views the description of the town after the fire, and the railroad tracks, as words "slash[ed] across the landscape", with a physicality similar to a Cézanne landscape. The minutely detailed passages of the campsite and Nick's mundane activities fill the story's foreground, while the forest and menacing swamp, relegated to the background, are described vaguely and only in passing. The river acts as a barrier between the foreground and background, and is present as deep in places, shallow in others, with currents that are either slow or fast. Berman says Nick is shown as a figure in a painting—seen in the foreground at the campsite and at a distance from the murky background of the swamp.
Nick is incapable of self-reflection and unable to cope with pain. Hemingway conveys this through symbolism and a series of <a href="objective%20correlative">objective correlative</a>s (tangible objects), which allow the reader insight to the character's motivations. For example, on his arrival in Seney he literally falls off the train, shocked at the sight of the burned town, but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience. Leaving behind the burnt landscape, Nick climbs a hill in the heat, and surveys the town's damage. The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war-torn Italy, but he hopes for regrowth: "It could not all be burned. He knew that". At the top of the hill, he takes a break, smokes a cigarette, and speaks for the first time. Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity, lost in the war, which he is beginning to regain.

Beyond the town the bridge over the river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness, healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps he sees it as a religious quest given the <a href="Ichthys">Christian symbolism of the fish</a>. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a> taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes "halcyon days, peace and tranquility". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully so as not to damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture.

His tent is portrayed as a less dark place than the emptiness outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.

"In our time" was published as part of Pound's modernist series by <a href="Three%20Mountains%20Press">Three Mountains Press</a>, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> described the writing as "of the first distinction", and in the 1940s he again wrote of "Big Two-Hearted River", "along with the mottled trout ... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece." When the story was published in the United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. In 1952, reviewing "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a>"—for which Hemingway would win the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> and the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>—"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said of "Big Two-Hearted River" that it was one of the "best and happiest of his early short stories".

Carlos Baker views the stories of "In Our Time" as a remarkable achievement for a young writer. Joseph Flora described "Big Two-Hearted River" as "unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection "In Our Time"". The piece has become one of Hemingway's most anthologized stories, and one of a handful subject to serious <a href="literary%20criticism">literary criticism</a> since its publication, and belongs in the canon of 20th-century American literature. Beegel writes that it is considered "among the best" American short stories, along with <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a>'s "<a href="The%20Open%20Boat">The Open Boat</a>", <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s "<a href="Young%20Goodman%20Brown">Young Goodman Brown</a>" and <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Usher">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>".

According to Benson, despite Pound and Joyce's influence, Hemingway "carried the new form into the position of dominant influence" for much of the 20th century. Unlike other modernist writers, who wrote of man cut off from the past, Hemingway placed his narratives in the present and hence became "the true modernist".

Nicky Barr

Andrew William "Nicky" Barr, (10 December 1915 – 12 June 2006) was a member of the <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australian national rugby union team</a>, who became a <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) during World War II. He was credited with 12 aerial victories, all scored flying the <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40</a> fighter. Born in New Zealand, Barr was raised in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia in the United Kingdom in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> in September 1941. The squadron's highest-scoring ace, he attained his first three victories in the P-40 Tomahawk and the remainder in the P-40 Kittyhawk.

Barr's achievements as a combat pilot earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a>. Shortly after taking command of No. 3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis forces</a>, and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> fugitives to safety, receiving for his efforts the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, a rare honour for an RAAF pilot. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of Normandy</a> in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a>. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the <a href="oilseed">oilseed</a> industry, for which he was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1983. He died in 2006, aged 90.

Andrew Barr was born in <a href="Wellington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Wellington</a>, New Zealand, on 10 December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Andrew attended <a href="Kew%2C%20Victoria">Kew Public School</a> and played <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the <a href="Lord%20Somers%20Camp">Lord Somers Camp</a> and Power House social and sporting organisations located at <a href="Western%20Port">Western Port</a>. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at <a href="Swinburne%20University%20of%20Technology">Swinburne Technical College</a>, but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> in 1935 through a friend in the Power House club. Weighing and just under tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a <a href="hooker%20%28rugby%20union%29">hooker</a> the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wallabies</a>. The tour was cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2 September, due to the outbreak of World War II. Keen to serve as a <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a>, Barr initially tried to enlist in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.

Returning to Australia on the <a href="RMS%20Strathaird">RMS "Strathaird"</a>, Barr joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as an air cadet on 4 March 1940. After undergoing instruction on <a href="Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moth</a>s at <a href="No.%203%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School</a>, <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a>, and on <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s and <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Service Flying Training School</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, he was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 24 September. He gained a reputation as something of a rebel during training, and became forever known as "Nicky", for "<a href="Christian%20teaching%20about%20the%20Devil">Old Nick</a>", or the Devil. In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students. By November 1940, he had been posted to <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s on patrol off the <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> coast. The aircraft was, according to Barr, "our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes that we were going to encounter, left much to be desired". Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was grateful to have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the Governor, <a href="Leslie%20Orme%20Wilson">Sir Leslie Wilson</a>, and also captained the RAAF rugby union team. He was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 24 March 1941.

Barr was posted to <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> on 28 September 1941, to fly with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> under the command of Squadron Leader <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffrey</a>. He converted to <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Tomahawk</a> fighters at an RAF <a href="Operational%20conversion%20unit">operational training unit</a> in <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>. There he also received his "<a href="goolie%20chit">goolie chit</a>", a piece of paper to be shown to local tribesmen in the event he was shot down, reading in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>: "don't kill the bearer, feed him and protect him, take him to the English and you will be rewarded. Peace be upon you." Returning to North Africa, Barr achieved his first aerial victory, over a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a>, on 12 December. He followed this up with a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B88">Junkers Ju 88</a> and a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a> on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87 "Stukas"</a>. On 8 March, he led a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> by twelve Ju 87s escorted by ten <a href="Macchi%20C.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B202">Macchi C. 202</a>s and two Bf 109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju 87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.

Eventually credited with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No. 3 Squadron's highest-scoring member. He flew a total of eighty-four combat <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16 June 1942 alone. His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings "could be offset by unbridled aggression", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and "overcome much better opponents by simply going for them". <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a> became No. 3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander. Promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 April, Barr was raised to acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken ankle. Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role. As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the next-of-kin of casualties himself.
Three times while serving with No. 3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11 January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf 109 and a <a href="Fiat%20G.50">Fiat G.50</a>, he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick up a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was "jumped" by two other Bf 109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines. As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight at it in an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by fragments of rock sent airborne by impact from cannon shells. A tribe of friendly <a href="Senussi">Senussi</a> Arabs found him, dressed his wounds, and helped him return to Allied lines. For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC), the full citation being published in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 20 February 1942:

On 25 May 1942, Barr had to land in the desert when his engine overheated. Having just taken off the engine <a href="cowling">cowling</a>, he spotted enemy tanks approaching and immediately took off with the engine exposed to the elements, safely landing back at base. He was shot down for the second time on 30 May, when he engaged eight Bf 109s and destroyed one before being hit and forced to crash land at high speed in no-man's land. He came down in a minefield during a fierce tank battle, and was forced to remain where he was as troops of both sides slowly converged on him; British forces managed to reach him first and, after treatment for wounds, he again returned to his squadron. On 26 June, however, after being attacked by two Bf 109s and bailing out of his burning Kittyhawk, he was captured by Italian soldiers and taken as a prisoner-of-war, first to <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>, and then to Italy, where he received hospital treatment for serious wounds. He later learned that the pilot who shot him down was Oberleutnant <a href="Werner%20Schr%C3%B6er">Werner Schroer</a>, a <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> ace credited with sixty-one victories in North Africa. Bobby Gibbes, having recovered from his own injuries, again took command of No. 3 Squadron. During his incarceration, on 5 February 1943, Barr was awarded a <a href="medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his DFC for "destroying further enemy aircraft".
Barr tried to escape from his confinement four times. By November 1942 he had recovered sufficiently from the injuries he received in June to break out of the hospital where he was being held in <a href="Bergamo">Bergamo</a>, northern Italy. He made his way to the Swiss border, but was challenged by an Italian customs official, whom he struck with a rock before being recaptured. Court-martialled on a charge of murder, he only avoided a death sentence when the <a href="Swiss%20Red%20Cross">Swiss Red Cross</a> colonel representing him located the official and proved that he had not died. Barr was instead sentenced to ninety days solitary confinement in Gavi Prison Camp, <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>. In August 1943, with Italy on the verge of surrender, prisoners of war were rounded up for transport to Germany. Barr jumped from a moving train bound for the <a href="Brenner%20Pass">Brenner Pass</a> and joined a group of Italian partisans in <a href="Pontremoli">Pontremoli</a>, remaining at large for two months before again being captured. Taken to a transit camp just over the Austrian border, Barr and fourteen other prisoners escaped by tunnelling under the barbed wire. Eventually he managed to link up with an Allied special operations unit, which was gathering intelligence behind enemy lines, sabotaging Axis infrastructure, and helping Allied prisoners and Italian refugees escape over the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennine Mountains</a> along the so-called "Alpine Route". He was recaptured and escaped once more before finally making it through the Alpine crossing himself, leading a group of more than twenty. After reaching friendly lines in March 1944, he was sent to a military hospital in <a href="Vasto">Vasto</a>, weighing only and in poor health, suffering <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, malnutrition, and blood poisoning. The assistance he rendered to fellow Allied fugitives earned him the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> (MC) for "Exceptional courage in organising escapes"; the award was <a href="gazette%23Gazette%20as%20a%20verb">gazetted</a> on 1 December 1944. He is thought to be one of only five or six RAAF pilots to receive the MC during World War II.

Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at <a href="Omaha%20Beach">Omaha Beach</a> two days after <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> as part of an air support control unit. During the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">campaign in Normandy</a>, he flew rocket-armed <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon</a>s on operations against <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a> launch sites. After his return to Australia on 11 September, Barr was promoted to acting <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> and appointed chief instructor at <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> in <a href="Mildura%2C%20Victoria">Mildura</a>, Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a>. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No. 6 RAAF Hospital, <a href="Heidelberg%2C%20Victoria">Heidelberg</a>. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8 October.

After leaving the Air Force, Barr remained in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had met on a blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No. 3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20 March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15 April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve. A member of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Forces%20Escaping%20Society">Royal Air Forces Escaping Society</a>, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.

In 1961, Barr became General Manager of Meggitt Ltd, an <a href="Vegetable%20fats%20and%20oils">oilseed-crushing</a> firm; he eventually rose to become Executive Chairman. The firm's board was joined in 1971 by the recently retired <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Sir Alister Murdoch</a>. Barr's work in the industry led to his appointment in the 1983 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE). The same year, he became Australian representative and Chairman of the International Oil Seed Group. In June 1987, Barr accepted an invitation to join <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, <a href="Chuck%20Yeager">Chuck Yeager</a>, and fifteen other famed flyers in a so-called "Gathering of Eagles" for a seminar at the USAF <a href="Air%20Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Air Command and Staff College</a> in <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>, Alabama. Generally reluctant to talk publicly about the war, he agreed to discuss his experiences during an episode of the television series "<a href="Australian%20Story">Australian Story</a>" in 2002, appearing with his biographer Peter Dornan, and Bobby Gibbes. By this time Barr was said to be receiving daily treatment for the injuries he had suffered in combat. He died at the age of ninety on 12 June 2006, a few months after his wife. Four <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> jet fighters from No. 3 Squadron overflew his funeral service on the <a href="Gold%20Coast%2C%20Queensland">Gold Coast</a>, Queensland. He was further honoured at a <a href="2006%20mid-year%20rugby%20test%20series">rugby test match between Australia and England</a> at <a href="Docklands%20Stadium">Telstra Dome</a> in Melbourne on 17 June, the day after his funeral. On 14 September 2006, No. 3 Squadron dedicated a stone memorial in Barr's honour; the unveiling was attended by his sons Bob and Brian.

Banksia prionotes

Banksia prionotes, commonly known as acorn banksia or orange banksia, is a species of <a href="shrub">shrub</a> or <a href="tree">tree</a> of the genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. It is native to the <a href="southwest%20botanical%20province">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and can reach up to in height. It can be much smaller in more exposed areas or in the north of its range. This species has serrated, dull green leaves and large, bright flower spikes, initially white before opening to a bright orange. Its common name arises from the partly opened <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>, which is shaped like an <a href="acorn">acorn</a>. The tree is a popular garden plant and also of importance to the <a href="floriculture">cut flower industry</a>.

"Banksia prionotes" was first described in 1840 by English botanist <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a>, probably from material collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, although it has been known to <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridise</a> with "<a href="Banksia%20hookeriana">Banksia hookeriana</a>". Widely distributed in <a href="south-west%20Western%20Australia">south-west Western Australia</a>, "B. prionotes" is found from <a href="Shark%20Bay">Shark Bay</a> (<a href="25th%20parallel%20south">25° S</a>) in the north, south as far as <a href="Kojonup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kojonup</a> (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> or low <a href="woodland">woodland</a>. <a href="pollination">Pollinated</a> by birds, it provides food for a wide array of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the <a href="Avon%20Wheatbelt">Avon Wheatbelt</a> region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.

"Banksia prionotes" grows as a tree up to high in southern parts of its distribution, but in northern parts it is usually a shorter tree or spreading shrub, reaching about in height; it diminishes in size as the climate becomes warmer and drier further north. It has thin, mottled grey, smooth or grooved bark, and <a href="tomentose">tomentose</a> young stems. The <a href="Leaf%23Arrangement%20on%20the%20stem">alternate</a> dull green leaves are long, and wide, with toothed <a href="leaf%20margin">leaf margin</a>s made up of triangular lobes, and often a wavy surface.

Flowers occur in a typical "Banksia" flower spike, an <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> made up of hundreds of small individual flowers, or florets, densely packed around a cylindrical axis. "B. prionotes" has cream-coloured flowers with a bright orange limb that is not revealed until the flower fully opens. Known as <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, this process sweeps through the inflorescence from bottom to top over a period of days, creating the effect of a cream inflorescence that progressively turns bright orange. The old flower parts fall away after flowering finishes, revealing the axis, which may bear up to 60 embedded <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. Oval or oblong in shape and initially covered in fine hairs, these follicles are from long and wide, and protrude from the cone. Inside, they bear two seeds separated by a brownish woody <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a>. The matte blackish seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure long by wide with a membranous 'wing'.

The root system consists of a main <a href="sinker%20root">sinker root</a>, and up to ten <a href="lateral%20root">lateral root</a>s extending from a non-<a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>ous <a href="root%20crown">root crown</a>. The main sinker root grows straight down to the water table; it may be up to long if the water table is that deep. Typically from in diameter immediately below the root crown, roots become gradually finer with depth, and may be less than half a centimetre (0.2 in) wide just above the water table. Upon reaching the water table, the sinker branches out into a network of very fine roots. The laterals radiate out horizontally from the base of the plant, at a depth of . They may extend over from the plant, and may bear secondary laterals; larger laterals often bear auxiliary sinker roots. Lateral roots seasonally form secondary rootlets from which grow dense surface mats of <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, which function throughout the wetter months before dying off with the onset of summer.

"Banksia prionotes" was first published by English botanist <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> in the January 1840 issue of his "<a href="A%20Sketch%20of%20the%20Vegetation%20of%20the%20Swan%20River%20Colony">A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony</a>"; hence the species' standard author citation is "Banksia prionotes" Lindl. He did not specify the <a href="Biological%20type">type material</a> upon which he based the species, but "A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony" is based primarily upon the collections of early settler and botanist <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a>. A sheet of mounted specimens at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> Herbarium (CGE), labelled "Swan River, Drummond, 1839" and annotated "Banksia prionotes m" in Lindley's hand, has since been designated the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a>. Lindley also made no mention of the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a>, ""prionotes"", but it is assumed to be derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "prion" ("saw") and "-otes" ("quality"), referring to the serrated leaf margins.
The most commonly reported <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s of "B. prionotes" are acorn banksia, derived from the resemblance of partly opened inflorescences to <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s; and orange banksia. Other reported common names include saw-toothed banksia and golden banksia "Bwongka" is a generic <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> name for "Banksia" in the <a href="Avon%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Avon River</a> catchment, where "B. prionotes" is one of several species occurring.

No further subspecies or varieties of "B. prionotes" have been described, and it has no <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a>s. Its only <a href="nomenclatural%20synonym">nomenclatural synonym</a> is "Sirmuellera prionotes" , which arose from <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>'s unsuccessful 1891 attempt to transfer "Banksia" into the new name "Sirmuellera". When <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his infrageneric arrangement</a> of "Banksia" in 1856, he placed "B. prionotes" in section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Eubanksia">"Eubanksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>, a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous. This series was discarded in <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">the 1870 arrangement</a> of <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a>; instead, "B. prionotes" was placed in section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Orthostylis">"Orthostylis"</a>, which Bentham defined as consisting of those "Banksia" species with flat leaves with serrated margins, and rigid, erect styles that "give the cones after the flowers have opened a different aspect". In 1981, Alex George published a revised arrangement that placed "B. prionotes" in the subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its flower spike, section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because its <a href="pistil">styles</a> are straight rather than hooked, and the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Crocinae">"Crocinae"</a>, a new series of four closely related species, all with bright orange <a href="perianth">perianth</a>s and <a href="pistil">pistil</a>s.

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published an arrangement informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Their arrangement</a> maintained "B. prionotes" in "B." subg. "Banksia", but discarded George's sections and his series "Crocinae". Instead, "B. prionotes" was placed at the end of series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a>, in subseries <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Cratistylis">"Cratistylis"</a>. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement. The placement of "B. prionotes" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>, which includes "Banksia". With respect to "B. prionotes", Mast's results are fairly consistent with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges. Series "Crocinae" appears to be <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>, and "<a href="Banksia%20hookeriana">B. hookeriana</a>" is confirmed as "B. prionotes" closest relative. Overall, however, the inferred <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksiinae" by publishing several new names, including subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"Spathulatae"</a> for the species of "Banksia" that have spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subgenus "Banksia"</a>. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. prionotes" is placed in subgenus "Banksia".

"Banksia prionotes" readily hybridises with "<a href="Banksia%20hookeriana">Banksia hookeriana</a>" (Hooker's banksia) under experimental conditions, indicating that these species have highly compatible pollen. The <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> <a href="Banksia%20%27Waite%20Orange%27">"B." 'Waite Orange'</a> is believed to be such a hybrid, having arisen by <a href="open%20pollination">open pollination</a> during a breeding experiment conducted at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide%23Waite">Waite Agricultural Research Institute</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> in 1988.
"Banksia prionotes" × "hookeriana" has also been verified as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a> species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough to each other for pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: "B. prionotes" has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of "B. hookeriana" usually does not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant <a href="F1%20hybrid">F1 hybrid</a>s are fully fertile, with seed production rates similar to that of the parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in <a href="hybrid%20swarm">hybrid swarm</a>s. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, <a href="speciation">speciation</a> might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.

"Banksia prionotes" × "hookeriana" hybrids have characteristics intermediate between the two parents. For example, the first putative hybrids studied had a habit "like that of gigantic "B. hookerana" [sic]", having inherited the size of "B. prionotes", together with "B. hookeriana"s tendency to branch from near the base of the trunk. Similarly, the infructescences were like "B. prionotes" in size, but had persistent flowers like "B. hookeriana". Inflorescences and leaves were intermediate in size and shape, and bark was like that of "B. prionotes".

During data collection for "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" project, a single presumed natural hybrid between "B. prionotes" and "<a href="Banksia%20lindleyana">B. lindleyana</a>" (porcupine banksia), with fruit like "B. lindleyana" but leaves intermediate between the two parents, was found north of <a href="Kalbarri%20National%20Park">Kalbarri National Park</a>. At the time this was considered an important discovery, as the parent species were thought not to be closely related. Mast's analyses, however, place them both in a <a href="clade">clade</a> of eight species, though "B. lindleyana" remains less closely related to "B. prionotes" than "B. hookeriana". Hybrids of "B. prionotes" with "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>" (firewood banksia) have also been produced by artificial means, and presumed natural hybrids have been recorded.

"Banksia prionotes" occurs throughout much of the <a href="Southwest%20Botanical%20Province">Southwest Botanical Province</a>, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from <a href="Shark%20Bay">Shark Bay</a> (25°30′S) in the north, to <a href="Kojonup">Kojonup</a> (33°50'S) and <a href="Jerramungup">Jerramungup</a> (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively. It grows among tall <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a> or low <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, mostly in the <a href="Swale%20%28landform%29">swale</a>s and lower slopes of <a href="dune">dune</a>s, and shows a very strong preference for deep white or yellow sand.

It is most common amongst the <a href="kwongan%20heath">kwongan heath</a> of the <a href="Geraldton%20Sandplains">Geraldton Sandplains</a> north of <a href="Jurien%2C%20Western%20Australia">Jurien</a>; it has a fairly continuous distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350 mm <a href="isohyet">isohyet</a>. On the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where <a href="tuart%20forest">tuart forest</a> gives way to <a href="jarrah%20forest">jarrah forest</a>. With the exception of a population at <a href="Point%20Walter">Point Walter</a> (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a>.

The soils east of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a> are generally too heavy for this species, with the exception of some isolated pockets of deep <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> or <a href="Aeolian%20sandstone">aeolian</a> yellow sand. "B. prionotes" thus has a very patchy distribution east of the scarp. This area nonetheless accounts for around half of its geographic range, with the species extending well to the south and south-east of the scarp. In total, the species occurs over a north–south distance of about , and an east–west distance of about .

The species is almost totally restricted to the <a href="Swale%20%28geographical%20feature%29">swales</a> and lower slopes of dunes. Various reasons for this have been proposed; on the one hand, it has been argued that its dependence on ground water necessitates that it grow only where ground water is relatively near the surface; on the other hand, it has been suggested that it cannot survive in higher parts of the landscape because fires are too frequent there. The latter hypothesis is supported by the recent expansion of "B. prionotes" along road verges of the <a href="Brand%20Highway">Brand Highway</a>, where fires are relatively rare. Despite "B. prionotes" occurrence in lower parts of the landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain have seen "B. prionotes" replace the more water-loving "<a href="Banksia%20littoralis">Banksia littoralis</a>" in some areas that were previously flood-prone.

The structure of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, there is a great deal of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a <a href="bud%23Types%20of%20buds">resting bud</a>, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.

Annual growth increases exponentially for the first eight years or so, but then slows down as resources are diverted into reproduction and the greater density of foliage results in reduced <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <a href="Photosynthetic%20efficiency">efficiency</a>.

The root structure of "B. prionotes" exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is <a href="phreatophyte">phreatophytic</a>, that is, its long taproot extends down to the water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains <a href="ion">ion</a>ic concentrations of <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a> that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.

The other common adaptation is the possession of <a href="cluster%20root">cluster root</a>s, which allow it to extract enough nutrients to survive in the <a href="oligotroph">oligotroph</a>ic soils in which it grows. With the onset of autumn rains, the lateral roots form dense surface mats of cluster roots in the top of soil, just below the leaf litter, where most minerals are concentrated. These roots exude chemicals that enhance mineral <a href="solubility">solubility</a>, greatly increasing the availability and <a href="mineral%20uptake">uptake</a> of <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s in impoverished soils such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia. For as long as <a href="surface%20water">surface water</a> is available, they take in water and a range of minerals. In "B. prionotes" they are principally responsible for the uptake of <a href="Malic%20acid">malate</a>, phosphate, chloride, sodium and potassium. When soils are high in <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, they may also perform some <a href="nitrate%20reductase">nitrate reductase</a> activities, primarily the conversion of <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> into <a href="amino%20acids">amino acids</a> such as <a href="asparagine">asparagine</a> and <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>.

The uptake of nutrient and water by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous supply of water from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as <a href="hydraulic%20redistribution">hydraulic redistribution</a>. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much <a href="biomass">biomass</a>, only for it to be lost at the end of the growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.

During winter, asparagine is <a href="metabolism">metabolised</a> immediately, but other nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, are removed from the <a href="Plant%20sap">xylem sap</a> and stored in mature <a href="plant%20stem">stem</a>, <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> and <a href="leaf">leaf</a> <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> for release back into the <a href="xylem">xylem</a> just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also the time when the oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise <a href="protein">protein</a> and non-<a href="amide">amide</a> amino acids such as <a href="aspartate">aspartate</a>, <a href="threonine">threonine</a>, <a href="serine">serine</a>, <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>, <a href="glycine">glycine</a>, <a href="alanine">alanine</a> and <a href="cystine">cystine</a>. Together with <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a> and other <a href="solution">solutes</a>, these are then circulated in the <a href="phloem">phloem</a>. The <a href="Plant%20sap">phloem sap</a> of "B. prionotes" is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium <a href="cation">cation</a>s, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate <a href="anion">anion</a>s. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining <a href="turgor%20pressure">turgor pressure</a>; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, "B. prionotes" is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.

Flowering begins in February and is usually finished by the end of June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.

The flowers are fed at by a range of <a href="Nectarivore">nectarivorous</a> birds: mainly <a href="honeyeaters">honeyeaters</a>, including the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("P. nigra"), <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="singing%20honeyeater">singing honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus virescens"), <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops") and <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"). <a href="Lorikeets">Lorikeets</a> have also been observed feeding at the flowers, as have insects, including ants, bees, and <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s. Of these, evidence suggests that only birds are effective pollinators. Insects apparently play no role in pollination, since inflorescences do not form follicles when birds are excluded in <a href="pollinator%20exclusion%20experiment">pollinator exclusion experiment</a>s; and pollination by mammals has never been recorded in this species.

Honeyeaters prefer to forage at individual flowers which have only just opened, as these offer the most <a href="nectar">nectar</a>. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.

The structure of the "Banksia" flower, with the style end functioning as a <a href="pollen%20presenter">pollen presenter</a>, suggests that <a href="autogamous">autogamous</a> <a href="self-fertilisation">self-fertilisation</a> must be common. In many "Banksia" species, the risk of this occurring is reduced by <a href="Dichogamy">protandry</a>: a delay in a flower's receptivity to pollen until after its own pollen has lost its viability. There is dispute, however, over whether this occurs in "B. prionotes": one study claimed to have confirmed "protandrous development", yet recorded high levels of stigmatic receptivity immediately after <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, and long pollen viability, observations that are not consistent with protandry.

If it does occur, protandry does nothing to prevent <a href="Geitonogamy">geitonogamous</a> self-pollination: that is, pollination with pollen from another flower on the same plant. In fact, when birds forage at "B. prionotes", only about a quarter of all movements from inflorescence to inflorescence involve a change of plant. Geitonogamous self-pollination must therefore occur more often in this species than <a href="cross-pollination">cross-pollination</a>. This does not imply high rates of self-fertilisation, however, as the species appears highly self-incompatible: although pollen grains will germinate on flowers of the self plant, they apparently fail to produce <a href="pollen%20tubes">pollen tubes</a> that penetrate the style. Even where cross-pollination does occur, fertilisation rate is fairly low. It is speculated that this is related to "a variety of chemical reactions at the pollen-stigma interface".

Cone production varies a great deal from year to year, but, as a result of its low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the <a href="Curculionidae">curculionid</a> <a href="weevil">weevil</a> "<a href="Cechides%20amoenus">Cechides amoenus</a>".

Like many plants in <a href="south-west%20Western%20Australia">south-west Western Australia</a>, "B. prionotes" is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "B. prionotes" is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.

The actual degree of serotiny and fire mortality in "B. prionotes" varies with latitude, or, more likely, climate. Observations suggest that it is always killed by fire in the north of its range, which is relatively hot and dry, and where individual plants are usually smaller, but may survive fire in the cooler, moister, south. Moreover, it is essentially non-serotinous in the south, since all seed is released by the end of the second year, but seed retention increases steadily to the north, and at the northern end of its range, it typically takes around four years for a plant to release half of its seed in the absence of bushfire, with some seed retained for up to 12 years.

A number of other characteristics of "B. prionotes" can be understood as secondary responses to weak serotiny. For example, winter flowering ensures that seed is ripe by the beginning of the bushfire season; this is very important for weakly serotinous species, which rely heavily upon the current year's seed crop. Another example is the deciduous florets of "B. prionotes". In strongly serotinous species, the old florets are retained on the cones, where they function as fire fuel, helping to ensure that follicles reach temperatures sufficient to trigger seed release. In "B. prionotes", however, seed release is triggered at relatively low temperatures: in one study, 50% of follicles opened at , and 90% opened at ; in contrast, the closely related but strongly serotinous "B. hookeriana" required respectively. Floret retention would therefore be to no advantage, and might even prevent seed from escaping spontaneously opened follicles.

Seed release in "B. prionotes" is promoted by repeated wetting of the cones. The <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that holds the seeds in place is <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it functions as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle over the course of a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.

Because of its higher susceptibility and lower reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for "B. prionotes" is higher than for other "Banksia" species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for "B. prionotes", compared to 15 years for "B. hookeriana" and 11 years for "B. attenuata". The same model suggested that "B. prionotes" is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.

Fire response may also furnish an explanation for the <a href="evolution">evolution</a> of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some <a href="introgression">introgression</a> at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a <a href="phenological">phenological</a> barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to <a href="genetic%20drift">drift</a> independently of each other.

"Banksia prionotes" is <a href="Vulnerability%20and%20susceptibility%20in%20conservation%20biology">susceptible</a> to a number of threatening processes. It is highly susceptible to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the <a href="floriculture">cut flower industry</a>; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter <a href="fire%20regime">fire regime</a>s; these have already been impacted by the <a href="Prehistory%20of%20Australia%23Arrival">arrival of humans</a>, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of "B. prionotes".

The species as a whole is not considered particularly <a href="Vulnerability%20and%20susceptibility%20in%20conservation%20biology">vulnerable</a> to these factors, however, as it is so widely distributed and common. Western Australia's <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Environment and Conservation</a> does not consider it to be rare, and has not included it on their <a href="Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List">Declared Rare and Priority Flora List</a>. It nonetheless has high conservation importance in at least one context: it is a <a href="keystone%20mutualist">keystone mutualist</a> in the <a href="Avon%20Wheatbelt">Avon Wheatbelt</a>, where it is the only source of nectar during a critical period of the year when no other nectar-producing plant is in flower. The loss of "B. prionotes" from the region would therefore mean the loss of all the honeyeaters as well, and this would affect the many other species of plants that rely on honeyeaters for pollination. The primary vegetation community in which "Banksia prionotes" occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt is considered a priority ecological community, and is proposed for formal gazetting as a <a href="threatened%20ecological%20community">threatened ecological community</a> under the name ""Banksia prionotes" and "<a href="Xylomelum%20angustifolium">Xylomelum angustifolium</a>" low woodlands on transported yellow sand". Although currently in near-pristine and static condition, it is considered at risk due to a large number of threatening processes, including land clearing, landscape fragmentation, rising <a href="salinity%20in%20Australia">soil salinity</a>, <a href="grazing%20pressure">grazing pressure</a>, competition with weeds, changes to the fire regime, rubbish dumping, and "P. cinnamomi" dieback.

Described as "an outstanding ornamental species", its brightly coloured, conspicuous flower spikes make "B. prionotes" a popular garden plant. It is good for attracting honeyeaters to the garden, and sometimes flowers twice a year. A low growing dwarf form which reaches high is available in Western Australia, sold as "Little Kalbarri Candles".

It is fairly easy to grow in areas with a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It requires a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to <a href="sowing">sowing</a>, and take 21 to 35 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>.

The species is also considered ideal for cut flower production, as its flowers fulfill the commercial criteria of terminal blooms and a long stem length. As such it is one of the most popular banksias for cut flower production, with commercial crops grown in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.

Green children of Woolpit

The legend of the green children of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin colour who reportedly appeared in the village of <a href="Woolpit">Woolpit</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, England, some time in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen</a>. The children, brother and sister, were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin. They spoke in an unknown language, and would only eat raw <a href="Vicia%20faba">broad beans</a>. Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, but the boy was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be "rather loose and wanton in her conduct". After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and her brother had come from Saint Martin's Land, a subterranean world inhabited by green people.

The only near-contemporary accounts are contained in <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a>'s "Historia rerum Anglicarum" and <a href="Ralph%20of%20Coggeshall">Ralph of Coggeshall</a>'s "Chronicum Anglicanum", written in about 1189 and 1220 respectively. Between then and their rediscovery in the mid-19th century, the green children seem to surface only in a passing mention in <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a>'s "Britannia" in 1586, and in <a href="Francis%20Godwin">Bishop Francis Godwin</a>'s fantastical "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20Moone">The Man in the Moone</a>" in the early 17th century, in both of which William of Newburgh's account is cited.

Two approaches have dominated explanations of the story of the green children: that it is a <a href="folklore">folktale</a> describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a historical event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> poet and critic <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a> in his "English Prose Style", published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, "<a href="The%20Green%20Child">The Green Child</a>", written in 1934.

The village of <a href="Woolpit">Woolpit</a> is in the county of <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, East Anglia, about east of the town of <a href="Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Bury St Edmunds</a>. During the Middle Ages it belonged to the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Abbey of Bury St Edmunds</a>, and was part of one of the most densely populated areas in rural England. Two writers, <a href="Ralph%20of%20Coggeshall">Ralph of Coggeshall</a> (died c. 1226) and <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> (c. 1136–1198), reported on the sudden and unexplained arrival in the village of two green children during one summer in the 12th century. Ralph was the abbot of a <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> monastery at <a href="Coggeshall">Coggeshall</a>, about south of Woolpit. William was a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> at the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian</a> <a href="Newburgh%20Priory">Newburgh Priory</a>, far to the north in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. William states that the account given in his "Historia rerum Anglicarum" (c. 1189) is based on "reports from a number of trustworthy sources"; Ralph's account in his "Chronicum Anglicanum", written some time during the 1220s, incorporates information from Sir Richard de Calne of Wykes, who reportedly gave the green children refuge in his manor, to the north of Woolpit. The accounts given by the two authors differ in some details.

One day at harvest time, according to William of Newburgh during the reign of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the <a href="trapping%20pit">wolf pits</a> that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw <a href="Vicia%20faba">broad beans</a>, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.

After learning to speak English, the children – Ralph says just the surviving girl – explained that they came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided by the sound of bells, eventually emerged into our land.

According to Ralph, the girl was employed for many years as a servant in Richard de Calne's household, where she was considered to be "very wanton and impudent". William says that she eventually married a man from <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a>, about from Woolpit, where she was still living shortly before he wrote. Based on his research into Richard de Calne's family history, the astronomer and writer <a href="Duncan%20Lunan">Duncan Lunan</a> has concluded that the girl was given the name "Agnes" and that she married a royal official named <a href="Richard%20Barre">Richard Barre</a>.

Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh offer an explanation for the "strange and prodigious" event, as William calls it, and some modern historians have the same reticence: "I consider the process of worrying over the suggestive details of these wonderfully pointless miracles in an effort to find natural or psychological explanations of what 'really,' if anything, happened, to be useless to the study of William of Newburgh or, for that matter, of the Middle Ages", says Nancy Partner, author of a study of 12th-century historiography. Nonetheless, such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations of the mystery of the green children. The first is that the narrative descends from <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a "fairy Otherworld". In a few early as well as modern readings, this other world is extraterrestrial, and the green children alien beings. The second is that it is a garbled account of a real event, although it is impossible to be certain whether the story as recorded is an authentic report given by the children or an "adult invention". His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that "there is clearly some mystery behind it all [the story of the green children], some story of drugging and kidnapping". Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers a different kind of historical explanation, arguing that the story is an oblique account of the racial difference between the contemporary English and the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">indigenous Britons</a>.

Scholars such as Charles Oman note that one element of the children's account, the entry into a different reality by way of a cave, seems to have been quite popular. <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> tells a similar story of a boy who, after escaping his master, "encountered two pigmies who led him through an underground passage into a beautiful land with fields and rivers, but not lit by the full light of the sun". But the <a href="Motif%20%28folkloristics%29">motif</a> is poorly attested; E. W. Baughman lists it as the only example of his <a href="Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson%20classification%20systems">F103.1 category</a> of English and North American folk tale motifs: "Inhabitants of lower world visit mortals, and continue to live with them". Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be significant, and sees the story of the green children as evidence that the feast of <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Day">Martinmas</a> has its origins in an English aboriginal past, of which the children's story forms "the lowest stratum". A contributor to "<a href="Notes%20and%20Queries">Notes and Queries</a>" in 1900 suggested a <a href="Celtic%20mythology">Celtic</a> connection: " 'Green' spirits are 'sinless' in Celtic literature and tradition ... It may be more than a coincidence that the green girl marries a 'man of [Kings] Lynn.' Here the original [Celtic word] would be "lein", evil, "i.e." the pure fairy marries a sinful child of earth."
In a modern development of the tale the green children are associated with the <a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>, who were left by their wicked uncle to die; in this version the children's green colouration is explained by their having been poisoned with arsenic. Fleeing from the wood in which they were abandoned, possibly nearby <a href="Thetford%20Forest">Thetford Forest</a>, the children fell into the pits at Woolpit where they were discovered. Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts states in his 1978 book "A Slice of Suffolk" that "I was told there are still people in Woolpit who are 'descended from the green children', but nobody would tell me who they were!"

Other commentators have suggested that the children may have been <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">aliens</a>, or inhabitants of a world beneath the Earth. In a 1996 article published in the magazine "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Analog</a>", astronomer <a href="Duncan%20Lunan">Duncan Lunan</a> hypothesised that the children were accidentally transported to Woolpit from their home planet as the result of a "matter transmitter" malfunction. Lunan suggests that the planet from which the children were expelled may be trapped in <a href="synchronous%20orbit">synchronous orbit</a> around its sun, presenting the conditions for life only in a narrow twilight zone between a fiercely hot surface and a frozen dark side. He explains the children's green colouration as a side effect of consuming the genetically modified alien plants eaten by the planet's inhabitants.

Lunan was not the first to state that the green children may have been extraterrestrials. <a href="Robert%20Burton%20%28scholar%29">Robert Burton</a> suggested in his 1621 that the green children "fell from Heaven", an idea that seems to have been picked up by <a href="Francis%20Godwin">Francis Godwin</a>, historian and Bishop of Hereford, in his speculative fiction "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20Moone">The Man in the Moone</a>", published posthumously in 1638.

Many <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> immigrants arrived in eastern England during the 12th century, and they were persecuted after <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> became king in 1154; a large number of them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fornham">Battle of Fornham</a> fought between Henry II and <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester</a>. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of <a href="Fornham%20St%20Martin">Fornham St Martin</a>, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish <a href="fulling">fuller</a>s existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by <a href="Hypochromic%20anemia">green sickness</a>, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being <a href="Flemish%20language">Flemish</a>.

Historian Derek Brewer's explanation is even more prosaic:
Jeffrey Jerome Cohen proposes that the story is about racial difference, and "allows William to write obliquely about the Welsh": the green children are a memory of England's past and the violent conquest of the indigenous Britons by the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> followed by the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman invasion</a>. William of Newburgh reluctantly includes the story of the green children in his account of a largely unified England, which Cohen juxtaposes with <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>'s "<a href="The%20History%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Britain">The History of the Kings of Britain</a>", a book that according to William is full of "gushing and untrammeled lying". Geoffrey's history offers accounts of previous kings and kingdoms of various racial identities, whereas William's England is one in which all peoples are either assimilated or pushed to the boundaries. According to Cohen, the green children represent a dual intrusion into William's unified vision of England. On one hand they are a reminder of the racial and cultural differences between Normans and Anglo-Saxons, given the children's claim to have come from St Martin's Land, named after <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">Martin of Tours</a>; the only other time William mentions that saint is in reference to in <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, which commemorates the Norman victory in 1066. But the children also embody the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles, the "Welsh (and Irish and Scots) who [had been] forcibly anglicized ... The Green Children resurface another story that William had been unable to tell, one in which English paninsular dominion becomes a troubled assumption rather than a foregone conclusion." The boy in particular, who dies rather than become assimilated, represents "an adjacent world that cannot be annexed ... an otherness that will perish to endure".

The English <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> poet and critic <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a> describes the story of the green children in his "English Prose Style", published in 1931, as "the norm to which all types of fantasy should conform". It was the inspiration for his only novel, "<a href="The%20Green%20Child">The Green Child</a>", written in 1934. A 1994 adaptation of the story by <a href="Kevin%20Crossley-Holland">Kevin Crossley-Holland</a> tells it from the point of view of the green girl.

Author John Macklin includes an account in his 1965 book, "Strange Destinies", of two green children who arrived in the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly as there is no record of any Spanish village called Banjos.

Australian novelist and poet <a href="Randolph%20Stow">Randolph Stow</a> uses the account of the green children in his 1980 novel "The Girl Green as Elderflower"; the green girl is the source for the title character, here a blond girl with green eyes. The green children become a source of interest to the main character, Crispin Clare, along with some other characters from the Latin accounts of William of Newburgh, Gervase of Tilbury, and others, and Stow includes translations from those texts: these characters "have histories of loss and dispossession that echo [Clare's] own".

The green children are the subject of a 1990 community opera performed by children and adults, composed by <a href="Nicola%20LeFanu">Nicola LeFanu</a> with a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> written by Kevin Crossley-Holland. In 2002 English poet <a href="Glyn%20Maxwell">Glyn Maxwell</a> wrote a <a href="Verse%20drama%20and%20dramatic%20verse">verse play</a> based on the story of the green children, "Wolfpit" (the earlier name for Woolpit), which was performed once in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. In Maxwell's version the girl becomes an indentured servant to the lord of the manor, until a stranger named Juxon buys her freedom and takes her to an unknown destination.

U.S. Route 50 in Nevada

U.S. Route 50 (US 50) is a transcontinental highway in the United States, stretching from <a href="West%20Sacramento%2C%20California">West Sacramento, California</a>, in the west to <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>, on the east coast. The <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> portion crosses the center of the state and was named The Loneliest Road in America by "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine in July 1986. The name was intended as a <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a>, but Nevada officials seized it as a marketing slogan. The name originates from large desolate areas traversed by the route, with few or no signs of civilization. The highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors, in what is known as the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20province">Basin and Range province</a> of the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>.

US 50 has a diverse route through the state, traversing the resort communities of <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a>, the state capital in <a href="Carson%20City%2C%20Nevada">Carson City</a>, historical sites such as <a href="Fort%20Churchill%20State%20Historic%20Park">Fort Churchill State Historic Park</a>, <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s, alpine forests, desert valleys, <a href="ghost%20towns">ghost towns</a>, and <a href="Great%20Basin%20National%20Park">Great Basin National Park</a>.

The route was constructed over a historic corridor, initially used for the <a href="Pony%20Express">Pony Express</a> and <a href="Central%20Overland%20Route">Central Overland Route</a> and later for the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>. Before the formation of the <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20System">U.S. Highway System</a>, most of US 50 in Nevada was designated State Route 2. The routing east of <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a> has changed significantly from the original plans. The route change resulted from a rivalry between Nevada and <a href="Utah">Utah</a> over which transcontinental route was better to serve <a href="California">California</a>-bound traffic, the Lincoln Highway or the <a href="Victory%20Highway">Victory Highway</a>.

US 50 crosses the central portion of <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, entering the west side of the state near <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> and exiting the east side near <a href="Great%20Basin%20National%20Park">Great Basin National Park</a>. The route crosses mostly desolate terrain in its journey across the state; US 50 passes through several large desert <a href="valleys">valleys</a> and <a href="Drainage%20basin">basins</a>. The highway crosses 17 named <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a>es that break up the Nevada desert. To crest some of the passes along US 50 requires navigating steep 8% <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">grades</a> and <a href="hairpin%20turn">hairpin turn</a>s through <a href="Temperate%20coniferous%20forest">pine forests</a> to reach elevations of over .

In the stretch of highway between <a href="Fallon%2C%20Nevada">Fallon</a> and <a href="Delta%2C%20Utah">Delta, Utah</a>, a span of , there are three small towns, <a href="Austin%2C%20Nevada">Austin</a>, <a href="Eureka%2C%20Nevada">Eureka</a>, and <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a>. This span is roughly the same distance as <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, Massachusetts, to <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, or <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, France, to <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, Switzerland. Traffic along US 50 varies greatly. The <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> in 2007 ranged from 52,000 vehicles per day in Carson City, to 530 vehicles per day near the <a href="Duckwater%2C%20Nevada">Duckwater</a> turnoff.

In addition to portions being designated the Loneliest Road and Lincoln Highway, the portion <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with <a href="Interstate%20580%20%28Nevada%29">Interstate 580</a> in Carson City is designated the Carson City Deputy Sheriff Carl Howell Memorial Freeway in honor of a <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff's officer</a> who was shot to death while attempting to rescue a victim of domestic violence from her house.

US 50 enters Nevada from <a href="California">California</a> as a busy four-lane thoroughfare on the shores of alpine <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> in <a href="Stateline%2C%20Nevada">Stateline, Nevada</a>. The highway follows the eastern shore, squeezing between the lake and the crest of the <a href="Carson%20Range">Carson Range</a>. In one narrow spot, the highway cuts through the mountains via the <a href="Cave%20Rock%20Tunnel">Cave Rock Tunnel</a>. Eventually, the route crests the Carson Range at <a href="Spooner%20Summit">Spooner Summit</a> and then descends into Nevada's capital, <a href="Carson%20City%2C%20Nevada">Carson City</a>. Carson Street and William Street formerly carried the highway through the city; however, in 2017, US 50 was moved to a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> alignment constructed for <a href="Interstate%20580%20%28Nevada%29">Interstate 580</a>.
After Carson City, US 50 follows the <a href="Carson%20River">Carson River</a> towards the <a href="Lahontan%20Valley">Lahontan Valley</a>. This portion is also mostly four-lane, serving the commuter towns of <a href="Dayton%2C%20Nevada">Dayton</a> and <a href="Silver%20Springs%2C%20Nevada">Silver Springs</a> as well as passing by <a href="Fort%20Churchill%20State%20Historic%20Park">Fort Churchill State Historic Park</a> and <a href="Lahontan%20State%20Recreation%20Area">Lahontan State Recreation Area</a>. In addition to the trails of the Pony Express and Lincoln Highway, this portion parallels the Carson River branch of the <a href="California%20Trail">California Trail</a>. The Carson River forms the southern edge of the <a href="Forty%20Mile%20Desert">Forty Mile Desert</a>. This desert, located between the termini of the Carson and <a href="Humboldt%20River">Humboldt River</a>s, was the most dreaded part of the California Trail, where travelers had to endure of desert heat with no usable water.

At Silver Springs, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20Alternate%20%28Nevada%29">U.S. Route 50 Alternate</a> splits from the main route. Both branches are sometimes called the loneliest road, and the promotional passport issued by the Nevada Commission on Tourism includes a stamping location at <a href="Fernley%2C%20Nevada">Fernley</a>, along the alternate branch. The two branches rejoin west of <a href="Fallon%2C%20Nevada">Fallon</a>. Fallon, home to the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Fallon">Naval Air Station Fallon</a> or <a href="TOPGUN">TOPGUN</a>, is an agricultural community along the last usable water of the Carson River. The town is located just south of the river's terminus at the <a href="Carson%20Sink">Carson Sink</a>. Leaving Fallon, the highway passes by ancient petroglyph sites at <a href="Grimes%20Point">Grimes Point</a> and then <a href="Sand%20Mountain%20%28Nevada%29">Sand Mountain</a>, a sand dune.

The scenery and level of traffic changes upon leaving the Fallon area. The road narrows from four lanes to two and crosses remote terrain characterized by <a href="Basin%20and%20range%20topography">Basin and Range</a> topography. The summits start out low and gradually increase in elevation. The features in the first basins include Labou Flat, a <a href="dry%20lake">dry lake</a> used by the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> for low-level flight operations, and <a href="Dixie%20Valley%2C%20Nevada">Dixie Valley</a>, with several visible <a href="fault%20scarp">fault scarp</a>s that resulted from the magnitude 7.1 Dixie Valley/Fairview <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> in 1954. Dixie Valley is now a US Navy Electronic Warfare Range.

The next services are in the single-building settlement of <a href="Middlegate%2C%20Nevada">Middlegate</a>, a roadhouse that has served as a restaurant, bar, hotel, and refueling station since the <a href="Pony%20Express">Pony Express</a> era of the 19th century. The building features Lincoln Highway and Pony Express era artifacts as well as plaques from various historical societies confirming the station is authentic. The station is the modern turnoff to <a href="Berlin%E2%80%93Ichthyosaur%20State%20Park">Berlin–Ichthyosaur State Park</a>, a preserved <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a> surrounded by dinosaur remains.

Nearby is a grove of <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwoods</a>, which includes a <a href="shoe%20tree%20%28roadside%20attraction%29">shoe tree</a>. Patrons of the bar at Middlegate are unsure of the origin of the shoe tree; however, most believe it started sometime in the mid-1980s. A legend has formed about how a young man was traveling to <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno</a> with his bride-to-be. When she balked and got out of the car, he threw her shoes in the tree so she couldn't get away. A reporter for the "San Francisco Chronicle" began to study the phenomenon of shoe trees after seeing the one at Middlegate, stating to his knowledge this was the biggest in the world. It was discovered on December 31, 2010, that the original shoe tree had been chopped down, possibly by vandals. Since then visitors have started a new shoe tree with another tree in the grove.

East of Middlegate, the paths of the Pony Express, Lincoln Highway, and US 50 diverge, using different passes to cross the <a href="Desatoya%20Mountains">Desatoya Mountains</a>. They rejoin west of <a href="Austin%2C%20Nevada">Austin</a>. The first paved route of the Lincoln Highway is preserved as <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20722">State Route 722</a>.

Austin lies east of Fallon. The city, founded by Pony Express riders who discovered silver, was a mining <a href="boomtown">boomtown</a> that now describes itself as a living ghost town. In 1862, at the peak of the silver boom, Austin had a population of 10,000 people. Today, about 300 residents remain. Perched above the town and just to the south of the highway is <a href="Stokes%20Castle">Stokes Castle</a>, a long abandoned monument to a prominent eastern family with local mining interests. Passing Austin, travelers encounter <a href="hairpin%20turn">hairpin turn</a>s and steep grades in the ascent up Austin Summit in the <a href="Toiyabe%20Range">Toiyabe Range</a>. This area is inside the <a href="Humboldt-Toiyabe%20National%20Forest">Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest</a>, the first part of US 50 to run inside a national forest since leaving Lake Tahoe. At Hickison Summit, about east of Austin, is the <a href="Hickison%20Petroglyph%20Recreation%20Area">Hickison Petroglyph Recreation Area</a>, a <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a> and campground featuring a walking tour of <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s.

The next town is <a href="Eureka%2C%20Nevada">Eureka</a>, which bills itself as the "Friendliest Town on the Loneliest Road in America". Eureka was similarly founded as a mining boom town. Although mining has diminished, it remains a large component of the community and its economy. The centerpiece of the historical district of Eureka is the <a href="Eureka%20Opera%20House">Eureka Opera House</a>, built in 1880.

Past Eureka is <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a>, founded as a stage coach station along the Pony Express and <a href="Central%20Overland%20Route">Central Overland Route</a>. Ely's mining boom came later than booms of other towns along US 50, with the discovery of <a href="copper">copper</a> in 1906. Though the railroads connecting the <a href="first%20transcontinental%20railroad">first transcontinental railroad</a> to the mines in Austin and Eureka have long been removed, the railroad to Ely is preserved as a <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a> by the <a href="Nevada%20Northern%20Railway">Nevada Northern Railway</a> and known as the Ghost Train of Old Ely. Here US 50 departs the historical routes of the Lincoln Highway, Pony Express, and State Route 2. These routes proceeded northeast towards <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a>, while US 50 joins with US 6 and US 93 heading east towards the state line.

Ely is the last city along US 50 in Nevada. The next city is <a href="Delta%2C%20Utah">Delta, Utah</a>, to the east; there are only two gas stations along the stretch between Ely and Delta. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20%28Nevada%29">US 93</a> continues south from the junction with US 50 at <a href="Majors%20Place%2C%20Nevada">Majors Place</a>. At the Nevada–Utah border, the highway passes by <a href="Border%2C%20Nevada">Border, Nevada</a>, with a gas station and restaurant.

This portion of the highway is mountainous with the highest point along US 50 in Nevada at Connors Pass at . This section has been designated a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byway">Scenic Byway</a> by the <a href="Nevada%20Scenic%20Byways">Nevada Scenic Byways</a> program. Listed attractions include the <a href="Ward%20Charcoal%20Ovens%20State%20Historic%20Park">Ward Charcoal Ovens State Historic Park</a> and <a href="Great%20Basin%20National%20Park">Great Basin National Park</a>. The highway enters Utah northeast of <a href="Baker%2C%20Nevada">Baker</a> in a remote portion of the <a href="Great%20Basin%20Desert">Great Basin Desert</a>.
From west to east US 50 crosses several mountain ranges using 17 passes and one tunnel.
In July 1986, "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine published an article that gave US 50 in Nevada the name "The Loneliest Road in America". The article portrayed the highway, and rural Nevada, as a place devoid of civilization. Officials from <a href="White%20Pine%20County%2C%20Nevada">White Pine County</a> decided to make the best of the publicity generated from the article, and convinced state authorities to do the same. Jointly, they began to use the <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a> article as a platform to market the area for visitors interested in desert scenery, history, and solitude. The <a href="Nevada%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Nevada Department of Transportation</a> adopted the name in official highway logs, and placed custom Highway 50 markers along the route.

The Nevada Commission on Tourism sponsors a promotion where visitors can stop at several designated locations along the route and have the passport section of a state issued "survival guide" marked with a stamp representing that location. Visitors can mail in the completed passport and receive a certificate, signed by the Governor, certifying they survived The Loneliest Road in America. The word "survived" is a <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> reference to the "Life" article, which quoted an <a href="American%20Automobile%20Association">American Automobile Association</a> spokesperson as saying, "We warn all motorists not to drive there unless they're confident of their survival skills."

Since the article was published, US 50 has gained popularity among people desiring a scenic or less traveled alternative to <a href="Interstate%2080%20in%20Nevada">Interstate 80</a> across Nevada. This increase in popularity has caused at least one writer to dispute whether US 50 still deserves the title of The Loneliest Road in America.
Traffic counts on US 50 are now considerably higher than on US 6, just to the south in <a href="Nye%20County%2C%20Nevada">Nye County</a>.
The 1971 road movie "<a href="Vanishing%20Point%20%281971%20film%29">Vanishing Point</a>", notable for its on-location filming across the southwest United States, used several sections of US 50 as part of the driving sequences.
In 1991, <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> drove along US 50 as part of a cross country trip. He stopped at <a href="Ruth%2C%20Nevada">Ruth</a>, a small town near <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a>. Studying the town, King fantasized about the fate of the residents. King then heard a local legend about how the ghosts of Chinese miners, who died while trapped in a cave-in, can be seen crossing Highway 50 to haunt the city of Ruth. King merged these details into his own story, including references to The Loneliest Road in America, which became the novel "<a href="Desperation%20%28novel%29">Desperation</a>".

In 2002, <a href="Neil%20Peart">Neil Peart</a>, then taking a sabbatical from <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>, published "", his account of a long-distance motorcycle journey across Canada and the United States. He traveled across US 50 in Nevada, and remarked on the complete absence of any development on long stretches of the road, including a sign reading "No Services for 88 Miles."

In 2008, the British television show "<a href="Top%20Gear%20%282002%20TV%20series%29">Top Gear</a>" featured the show's presenters <a href="Jeremy%20Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>, <a href="Richard%20Hammond">Richard Hammond</a>, and <a href="James%20May">James May</a> driving across Nevada along US 50 in the cars of their choice. Clarkson stated he was "mesmerised by the straightness of the road."

In Nevada, US 50 was built mostly along the route of the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>, the first transcontinental highway in the United States, formed in 1913. Through Nevada, the route of the Lincoln Highway had been previously used by the <a href="Pony%20Express">Pony Express</a>, an early attempt at an express mail service, started in 1860. The Pony Express used the technique of riders changing horses at stations approximately apart to maximize speed. Many of the towns along US 50 originally served as stations along the Pony Express. The original numbered designation of this route, which appeared on Nevada Highway maps as far back as 1919, was State Route 2. Route 2 had an alternate branch, Route 2A, corresponding to a split in the Lincoln Highway near <a href="Fallon%2C%20Nevada">Fallon</a>. The main and alternate branches of Route 2 are reversed from the modern routings of US 50. Mainline Route 2, the <a href="Donner%20Party">Donner Branch</a>, terminated at <a href="Fernley%2C%20Nevada">Fernley</a> along modern US 50 Alternate. State Route 2A, the Pioneer Branch, followed mainline US 50, terminating at <a href="Carson%20City">Carson City</a>. State Route 2, and the Lincoln Highway, used a different routing between <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a> and <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> from the modern routes. The original routing used what is now <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20%28Nevada%29">US 93</a> from Ely to the ghost town of <a href="Schellbourne%2C%20Nevada">Schellbourne</a> and then dirt roads towards <a href="Tooele%2C%20Utah">Tooele, Utah</a>.

In 1926, when the <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20system">U.S. Highway system</a> was announced, there was a gap in US 50 between Ely and <a href="Thistle%2C%20Utah">Thistle, Utah</a>. At the time, the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>s would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway system. Utah officials refused to pave the portion of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. They perceived this route as being expensive to build, with no benefit for the state. Nevada officials, and the Lincoln Highway Association, pleaded with Utah authorities to change their position, even offering funds to help offset the additional cost of paving that route. However, the Lincoln highway directed travelers destined for both <a href="southern%20California">southern</a> and <a href="northern%20California">northern California</a> on a route away from Utah cities, towards central Nevada. Utah instead paved the <a href="Wendover%20Cutoff">Wendover Cutoff</a>, part of the <a href="Victory%20Highway">Victory Highway</a> (modern <a href="Interstate%2080%20in%20Utah">Interstate 80</a>), that only directed traffic for northern California out of the state. The choice not to pave the Lincoln Highway would direct travelers bound for southern California to use the <a href="Arrowhead%20Trail%20%28auto%20trail%29">Arrowhead Trail</a> (modern <a href="Interstate%2015">Interstate 15</a>). This route serves numerous communities in Utah, but only <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> and a few other small towns in Nevada. The final blow to the original route of the Lincoln Highway was the formation of the <a href="Dugway%20Proving%20Ground">Dugway Proving Ground</a>, a military base used for weapons testing, which closed the area to the public. The Lincoln Highway was re-routed to Salt Lake City along a circuitous route via <a href="Wendover%2C%20Utah">Wendover</a> and the <a href="Bonneville%20Salt%20Flats">Bonneville Salt Flats</a>. This route was initially numbered US 50 from Ely to Wendover and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Utah">US 40</a>/50 across western Utah, but has been renumbered US 93, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20Alternate%20%28Nevada%29">US 93 Alternate</a> and I-80.

Most of modern US 50 was pieced together from several routes designated as Nevada State Routes in the early 20th century. The portion from Lake Tahoe to Carson City was originally a portion of <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%203">State Route 3</a>. The original designation for US 50 from Carson City to Ely was Route 2 and 2A. East of Ely was originally numbered Route 7 to the modern junction with US 93 and Route 14 from there to the Utah state line.

The modern route of US 50 has significantly changed since the highway was first commissioned in 1926. The biggest change is between Ely and <a href="Green%20River%2C%20Utah">Green River, Utah</a>. The first contiguous route of the highway between these cites followed the modified routing of the Lincoln Highway to Salt Lake City. The highway returned to Green River along what is now numbered <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%20201">UT 201</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2089%20%28Utah%29">US 89</a>, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20%28Utah%29">US 6</a>. The route was changed when the more direct route between these cities (via <a href="Delta%2C%20Utah">Delta, Utah</a>) was paved. The 1954 edition of the Nevada highway map was the first to show the new routing.

Previously, the road to Delta consisted of unpaved state routes. The paved route did not follow the exact route of the old dirt roads. The improved route bypassed the ghost town of <a href="Osceola%2C%20Nevada">Osceola</a> and entered Utah approximately to the south of the dirt road. The border crossing was moved to facilitate an easier route across western Utah. In Utah, the old road traversed a difficult route through Marjum Canyon, while the paved route followed a simpler path along the north shore of <a href="Sevier%20Lake">Sevier Lake</a>.

Three different routes have existed between <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> and <a href="Carson%20City%2C%20Nevada">Carson City</a>. The original, used by the Lincoln Highway, was previously known as Johnson's Cutoff or the Carson Ridge Emigrant Road. This route, which followed Kings Canyon to scale the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, was severely damaged by a flood in 1997. The <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> still promotes this road for its historical value, but has announced that it will no longer be maintained and travel is only recommended by foot, horse, or <a href="four%20wheel%20drive">four wheel drive</a> vehicle. A portion in the lower part of the canyon inside Carson City limits was maintained by the state as Kings Canyon Road (<a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20512">SR 512</a>) until 2009. In 1923, while still known as State Route 3, the road to Lake Tahoe was changed to follow Clear Creek Canyon, along a path that had been used for a series of tunnels and <a href="flume">flume</a>s, to transport timber from Lake Tahoe to the <a href="Virginia%20and%20Truckee%20Railroad">Virginia and Truckee Railroad</a> depot in Carson City.
The iteration is now known as Old Clear Creek Road. Only a small portion of Old Clear Creek Road is currently maintained by the state as unsigned <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20705">SR 705</a>, the remainder is an access road for private residences in the canyon. The modern route, also using Clear Creek Canyon, was built in the late 1950s.

US 50 was rerouted through the eastern half of Fallon. The original route is not drivable as it runs through <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Fallon">Naval Air Station Fallon</a>; portions are still in public use as Harrigan Road (<a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20115">SR 115</a>) and Berney Road (<a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20119">SR 119</a>). Around 1967, US 50 was improved between Middlegate and Austin, to bypass steep grades and sharp curves over Carroll Summit. The original route is now <a href="Nevada%20State%20Route%20722">SR 722</a>. In 2017, US 50 was re-aligned onto the completed <a href="Interstate%20580%20%28Nevada%29">Interstate 580</a> bypass, replacing its former route through downtown Carson City.

Al-Kateb v Godwin

Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a decision of the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the <a href="indefinite%20detention%20without%20trial">indefinite detention</a> of a <a href="stateless%20person">stateless person</a> was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a <a href="Palestinians">Palestinian</a> man born in <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, who moved to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> in 2000 and applied for a <a href="temporary%20protection%20visa">temporary protection visa</a>. The Commonwealth <a href="Minister%20for%20Immigration%20and%20Citizenship%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Immigration</a>'s decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Court</a>. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of <a href="mandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia">mandatory detention</a>.

The two main issues considered by the High Court were whether the <a href="Migration%20Act%201958">Migration Act 1958</a> (the legislation governing <a href="immigration%20to%20Australia">immigration to Australia</a>) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and if so, whether this was permissible under the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution of Australia</a>. A majority of the court decided that the Act did allow indefinite detention, and that the Act was not unconstitutional.

The controversy surrounding the outcome of the case resulted in a review of the circumstances of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention. In 2007, nine of these people, including Al-Kateb, were granted bridging visas and allowed to enter the community.

Ahmed Al-Kateb was born in Kuwait in 1976, the son of Palestinian parents. Kuwait's Nationality Law is based on the citizenship of the parents, "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>", (Article 2) and does not provide for citizenship based on place of birth, "<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>", except in the case of <a href="child%20abandonment">foundlings</a> (Article 3). For this reason Al-Kateb did not acquire Kuwaiti <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a> at birth, and was thus considered a stateless person. Al-Kateb left his country of birth after Kuwaiti authorities pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to <a href="Palestinian%20exodus%20from%20Kuwait%20%28Gulf%20War%29">leave Kuwait</a>. In December 2000, Al-Kateb, travelling by boat, arrived in Australia without a <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a> or <a href="passport">passport</a>, and was taken into immigration detention under the provisions of the "Migration Act 1958".

In January 2001, Al-Kateb applied for a protection visa, on the grounds that the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> 1954 <a href="Convention%20Relating%20to%20the%20Status%20of%20Stateless%20Persons">Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons</a> obliged Australia to protect him. His application was rejected, a decision upheld by the <a href="Refugee%20Review%20Tribunal">Refugee Review Tribunal</a> and the Federal Court of Australia. In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>. However attempts by the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Government of Australia</a> to remove Al-Kateb to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, Kuwait, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, and the <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a> (which would have required the approval of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>) failed.

Al-Kateb then applied to the Federal Court for <a href="writ">writ</a>s of <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a> and <a href="mandamus">mandamus</a>, demanding that immigration officials comply with section 198 of the "Migration Act" which required that Al-Kateb, because his application for a visa had been rejected, be removed from the country "as soon as reasonably practicable". However, those applications were dismissed. Al-Kateb then sought writs of habeas corpus and mandamus on the basis that he was being unlawfully detained, and although the judge found that "removal from Australia is not reasonably practicable at the present time as there is no real likelihood or prospect of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future", his application was dismissed. However, a case with substantially identical facts, decided twelve days later by a Full Court of the Federal Court, resulted in the release of another detainee, Akram Al Masri.
Finally, Al-Kateb appealed the decision against him to a Full Court of the Federal Court, hoping that the reasoning applied in the Al Masri case (which was factually similar to his situation) would be applied to him. The appeal was removed into the High Court at the request of the then <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General of Australia</a> <a href="Daryl%20Williams%20%28politician%29">Daryl Williams</a>, under provisions of the "<a href="Judiciary%20Act%201903">Judiciary Act 1903</a>". Pending the appeal, Al-Kateb was released in April 2003, by an <a href="interlocutory">interlocutory</a> consent order of the Federal Court. The case was argued alongside two other cases which also concerned immigration detention and hearings were held on 12 November and 13 November 2003.

The respondents in the case were all members of the Government of Australia, including two officials in the <a href="Department%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20Affairs">Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs</a>, and the then Minister for Immigration, <a href="Phillip%20Ruddock">Phillip Ruddock</a>, and were represented by the <a href="Solicitor-General%20of%20Australia">Solicitor-General of Australia</a>, <a href="David%20Bennett%20%28barrister%29">David Bennett</a>. The first named respondent, Philippa Godwin, was Deputy Secretary of DIMIA. Al-Kateb was represented by Claire O'Connor, from the <a href="Legal%20Services%20Commission%20of%20South%20Australia">Legal Services Commission of South Australia</a>.

The question in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That question involved several issues, namely whether the provisions of the "Migration Act" allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.

Since Al-Kateb's application for a visa was rejected, he was classified as an unlawful non-citizen. Section 196 of the "Migration Act" provides that unlawful non-citizens can only be released from immigration detention if they are granted a visa, deported, or removed from Australia. Section 198(6) of the Act requires immigration officials to "remove [from Australia] as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen".

One possible interpretation of these provisions is that unlawful non-citizens should be kept in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.

Much of the argument for Al-Kateb centred on the fact that he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the "Migration Act" about <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless people. In one such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, "SHDB" (in matters concerning <a href="asylum%20seeker">asylum seeker</a>s, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice <a href="Michael%20Kirby%20%28judge%29">Kirby</a> said that "there often is a very good reason... because people suffer great risks if their name goes on the Internet that that will become known to the country that they want to avoid," to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country."

The respondents argued that the provisions required that unlawful non-citizens be detained until their removal, and that the purpose of removal, on which the detention was founded, did not cease to exist just because it was not practicable in the foreseeable future to carry out that purpose. They made what was referred to as "the 'never say never' proposition", that although securing a person's removal or deportation from Australia may be difficult, and "often it takes years of diplomatic negotiation before a country is prepared to accept someone... it is very hard to imagine a case where the purpose of removal or deportation is one that can never occur." Although the respondents did not challenge the finding of fact in the Federal Court that there was no real possibility of Al-Kateb's removal in the foreseeable future, they argued that the test applied to reach that decision "fails to take into account... the difficulties and the fact that things can change."

The issue of whether the Act was constitutionally valid revolved around the fact that immigration detention is a form of administrative detention, or detention imposed by the <a href="executive%20government">executive branch</a> of government. Detention generally is considered to be a judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to <a href="Chapter%20III%20of%20the%20Australian%20Constitution">Chapter III of the Australian Constitution</a>. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an <a href="arrest">arrest</a>, or detention for <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.

In this situation, the court had decided in previous cases that immigration detention, for the purposes of processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the "Migration Act" extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, "Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri", in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.

The respondents focused on the case in which this system of exceptions was first articulated, "<a href="Chu%20Kheng%20Lim%20v%20Minister%20for%20Immigration%2C%20Local%20Government%20and%20Ethnic%20Affairs">Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs</a>". The concept of detention as an exclusively judicial function was clearly articulated by only three judges out of seven, <a href="Gerard%20Brennan">Brennan</a>, <a href="William%20Deane">Deane</a> and <a href="Daryl%20Dawson">Dawson</a>, and although in later cases that central concept was generally agreed with, their list of exceptions was not. The respondents focused on Justice <a href="Mary%20Gaudron">Gaudron</a>'s decision in "Chu", in which she said:

Detention in custody in circumstances not involving some breach of the criminal law and not coming within well-accepted categories of the kind to which Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ refer is offensive to ordinary notions of what is involved in a just society. But I am not presently persuaded that legislation authorizing detention in circumstances involving no breach of the criminal law and travelling beyond presently accepted categories is necessarily and inevitably offensive to Ch.III.

The respondents also noted that Gaudron made similar comments in the <a href="Kruger%20v%20Commonwealth">Stolen Generations case</a>, which also considered non-judicial detention in the context of <a href="Stolen%20Generation">Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care</a>. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.

The ultimate decision, reached by a majority of four judges to three, was that the "Migration Act" did permit indefinite detention. Each judge delivered a separate judgment with Justices <a href="Michael%20McHugh%20%28judge%29">McHugh</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Hayne">Hayne</a>, <a href="Ian%20Callinan">Callinan</a> and <a href="Dyson%20Heydon">Heydon</a> forming the <a href="majority%20opinion">majority</a>, although Justice Heydon agreed entirely with Justice Hayne, and offered no extra reasoning. <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Australia">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Murray%20Gleeson">Gleeson</a> and Justices <a href="William%20Gummow">Gummow</a> and <a href="Michael%20Kirby%20%28judge%29">Kirby</a> <a href="dissenting%20opinion">dissented</a>, finding instead that the "Migration Act" should not be interpreted to permit indefinite detention.

Justice Hayne delivered the leading judgment for the majority. On the question of whether the "Migration Act" allowed people in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, he said:

...the most that could ever be said in a particular case where it is not now, and has not been, reasonably practicable to effect removal, is that there is no country which will receive a particular non-citizen whom Australia seeks to remove, and it cannot be predicted when that will happen.

He said that because the removal or deportation of people always involves some degree of uncertainty, then the interpretation of the relevant provisions in the "Migration Act" could not proceed on the assumption that removal is always possible. He concluded that:

...even if, as in this case, it is found that 'there is no real likelihood or prospect of [the non-citizen's] removal in the reasonably foreseeable future', that does not mean that continued detention is not for the purpose of subsequent removal.

Justice McHugh stated simply that the language of the sections was not ambiguous, and clearly required the indefinite detention of Al-Kateb. He said that the requirement that people be removed "as soon as reasonably practicable" was directed at limiting the duration of detention to as little as necessary, but it did "not mean that the detention... is limited to a maximum period expiring when it is impracticable to remove or deport the person."

Chief Justice Gleeson, in dissent, said that in interpreting legislation, the courts "do not impute to the legislature an intention to abrogate or curtail certain human rights or freedoms (of which personal liberty is the most basic) unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unambiguous language". He concluded that the provisions requiring that unlawful non-citizens be detained were ambiguous in that in a situation such as Al-Kateb's, where it became impossible to fulfil the purpose for which he was detained, the law was not clear as to whether the result is that the detention should be suspended until the purpose becomes possible again, or that the detention should continue indefinitely. The Act did not deal with a situation like Al-Kateb's. Gleeson said:

In making that choice I am influenced by the general principle of interpretation stated above. I am also influenced by the consideration that the detention in question is mandatory, not discretionary. In a case of uncertainty, I would find it easier to discern a legislative intention to confer a power of indefinite administrative detention if the power were coupled with a discretion...

Accordingly, he found that a proper construction of the provisions of the Act would not permit Al-Kateb's detention to continue indefinitely.

Justice Callinan, who was in the majority, also discussed the purpose of detention, in "<a href="obiter%20dictum">obiter dicta</a>". He said that detention of non-citizens for the purposes of deportation may not be the only form of detention that would be within the federal parliament's <a href="Section%2051%28xix%29%20of%20the%20Australian%20Constitution">aliens power</a>, rather "it may be the case that detention for the purpose of preventing aliens from entering the general community, working, or otherwise enjoying the benefits that Australian citizens enjoy is constitutionally acceptable."

The second issue was whether indefinite detention for migration purposes infringed on Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. While every judge discussed this issue, only three judges, Justices McHugh, Hayne and Heydon, found it necessary to make a final decision on the issue. They all reached the same conclusion, that the detention scheme was constitutional.

Justice Hayne concluded that the detention scheme in the "Migration Act" did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although it had been in the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from a system in which all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.

Justice McHugh also emphasised that immigration detention was not punitive, saying:

A law requiring the detention of the alien takes its character from the purpose of the detention. As long as the purpose of the detention is to make the alien available for deportation or to prevent the alien from entering Australia or the Australian community, the detention is non-punitive.

McHugh suggested that detention for a non-punitive purpose could still offend Chapter III if it prevented a court "from determining some matter that is a condition precedent to authorising detention." However, that was not the case here.

In dissent, Justice Gummow recognised that "the focusing of attention on whether detention is 'penal or punitive in character' is apt to mislead", and emphasised the purpose of detention as the fundamental criterion by which non-judicial detention was allowed in previous cases. He said that "it cannot be for the executive government to determine the placing from time to time of that boundary line which marks off a category of deprivation of liberty from the reach of Ch III."

In addition to the substantive issues in the case, there was also more general historical and theoretical issues involved. During Justice <a href="Michael%20McHugh%20%28judge%29">McHugh</a>'s final years on the court, he and Justice <a href="Michael%20Kirby%20%28judge%29">Kirby</a> expressed differing views on <a href="constitutional%20interpretation">constitutional interpretation</a>, and particularly on the role of <a href="international%20law">international law</a> and principles of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> in that process. In this case, the two judges continued that debate.

Justice McHugh drew analogies between the legislation at issue in the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite administrative detention, such as the arrangements under the "<a href="War%20Precautions%20Act%201914">War Precautions Act 1914</a>". <a href="Regulation">Regulation</a>s made under that and other acts allowed the <a href="internment">internment</a> of several thousand people, including <a href="German%20Australian">German Australian</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="Japanese%20Australian">Japanese Australian</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of "<a href="Lloyd%20v%20Wallach">Lloyd v Wallach</a>"), and emphasised that at no time had anyone questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was "tragic", the courts were not at liberty to question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given the absence of a <a href="bill%20of%20rights">bill of rights</a> in Australia.

Justice Kirby retorted that "'Tragic' outcomes are best repaired before they become a settled rule of the Constitution." He also drew a historical analogy, referring to the 1951 <a href="Australian%20Communist%20Party%20v%20Commonwealth">Communist Party case</a> where the High Court rejected attempts by the <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Menzies</a> government to outlaw the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Australian Communist Party</a>. After noting McHugh's recent praise of the decision in a speech, Kirby said:

We should be no less vigilant than our predecessors were. As they did in the "Communist Party Case", we also should reject Executive assertions of self-defining and self-fulfilling powers. We should deny such interpretations to federal law, including the Act... This Court should be no less defensive of personal liberty in Australia than the courts of the United States, the United Kingdom and the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> for <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> have been, all of which have withheld from the Executive a power of unlimited detention.

Referring to the cases in which the High Court had upheld the wartime legislation allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.

Finally, Kirby also suggested that there was much scope for expanding the reach of the limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of <a href="due%20process">due process</a> rights as implicit constitutional rights, in the absence of an explicit bill of rights.

As a result of the decision, Al-Kateb had to return to immigration detention. Claire O'Connor, Al-Kateb's lawyer, said, "The effect of this decision is that [Al-Kateb] will be locked up until a state of Palestine is created or some other Middle Eastern state is willing to have him. It's taken 51 years so far. I'm not holding my breath."

The decision sparked much controversy about the scope of the mandatory detention laws. Along with the two other immigration detention decisions handed down on that day, the case prompted several political leaders, including the Federal President of the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, <a href="Carmen%20Lawrence">Carmen Lawrence</a>, and <a href="Australian%20Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> leader, Senator <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a>, to call for an Australian bill of rights. The executive director of the <a href="Sydney%20Institute">Sydney Institute</a>, <a href="Gerard%20Henderson">Gerard Henderson</a>, said that the case demonstrated "the need for empathy in public policy".

However, the case also aroused controversy about the court itself. <a href="David%20Marr%20%28journalist%29">David Marr</a> described the 4–3 decision as indicating a new division in the composition of the court, the "liberty divide", and noted that the result on the liberty question moved the court in the opposite direction to the contemporary trends of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> and the <a href="judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Arthur Glass observed that the minority judges began their judgments from the position that indefinite non-judicial detention and the curtailment of personal freedom were troubling consequences, and he noted that "as is not uncommon in statutory construction, where you start from is critical to where you end up". Marr accused the majority of deciding that "saving Australia from <a href="boat%20people">boat people</a> counts for more than Al-Kateb's raw liberty".

The controversy resulted in pressure on the new Immigration Minister <a href="Amanda%20Vanstone">Amanda Vanstone</a>, who agreed to review the cases of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention and ultimately granted bridging visas to nine people including Al-Kateb, allowing them to be released into the community. However, the conditions of the bridging visas did not permit holders to work, study, obtain <a href="social%20security">social security</a> benefits or receive healthcare from <a href="Medicare%20%28Australia%29">Medicare</a>, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, "We [are] just walking in a big detention. And we are all the time worried that they will send us back to detention again... It's like a death punishment." He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister <a href="Kevin%20Andrews%20%28politician%29">Kevin Andrews</a>.

In a 2005 speech to the Law Society of the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, Justice McHugh reiterated his view of the case as a tragic situation and said that it was necessary for "the informed and impassioned" to seek reforms to legislation to protect individual rights since the absence of a bill of rights limited the ability of the courts to protect rights. McHugh said that cases in countries such as the United Kingdom, in which courts had found that indefinite administrative detention was not lawful, were based on bills of rights or other instruments, such as the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, and lamented that without such instruments, Australian courts are "not empowered to be as active as the Supreme Court of the United States or the House of Lords in the defence of the fundamental principles of human rights".

In response to McHugh's speech, Chief Justice <a href="Murray%20Gleeson">Gleeson</a> said that the issue of whether or not Australia should have a bill of rights was a purely political one and not a matter for the courts. Gleeson said that while he had personal political views on the matter, "It doesn't serve the community for a serving Chief Justice to enter that arena."

In academic circles, the case is generally seen as an example of the court taking two different approaches to <a href="statutory%20interpretation">statutory interpretation</a>, with the <a href="legalism%20%28Western%20philosophy%29">legalistic</a> approach of the majority judges contrasting with the <a href="purposive%20theory">purposive</a> approach of the minority judges.

Christopher Richter suggested that the majority's legalistic approach, while yielding a workable construction of the provisions of the "Migration Act", resulted in a dangerous situation in this case because the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation to be filled.

Matthew Zagor suggested that there are various assumptions about the constitutional relationship between the branches of government implicit in those two different approaches. He argues that the majority, particularly Justice <a href="Ian%20Callinan">Callinan</a>, preferred the <a href="plain%20meaning">plain meaning</a> of the "Migration Act" because for them, "the key principle at play is simple: the Court should not frustrate Parliament's purpose or obstruct the executive". Zagor also comments on the <a href="irony">irony</a> that the supposedly-legalistic conclusion reached by the majority is at odds with a prior High Court decision, led by Australia's most prominent legalist, Chief Justice <a href="Owen%20Dixon">Owen Dixon</a>, who implied a temporal limit onto World War II-era legislation, which also included a scheme of executive detention.

Some commentators, such as Juliet Curtin, have noted that both the majority and minority judgments, except for that of Justice <a href="Michael%20Kirby%20%28judge%29">Kirby</a>, focused almost exclusively on Australian law and did not consider either international law or decisions from other <a href="common%20law">common law</a> countries. Curtin argues that the attitude to international jurisprudence, which included decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the House of Lords, demonstrates an "insular disregard for the principles of international law" on the court's part.

Several commentators have expressed the view that the decision has produced confusion and uncertainty with respect to constitutional restrictions on executive power in this area. Matthew Zagor noted that while the three minority Justices in this case and Justice Callinan in another case have expressed their support for the existing test in "Chu Kheng Lim" (that non-punitive detention is constitutionally permissible if it is "reasonably capable of being seen as necessary"), the test was not in fact used by the majority in this case to conclude that the detention here was permissible. He also pointed out that in later cases, only Justice Kirby seemed to uphold the 'vibe' of the "Chu Kheng Lim" test, with Chief Justice <a href="Murray%20Gleeson">Gleeson</a> and Justice <a href="William%20Gummow">Gummow</a> attempting to separate the character of detention from its consequences (suggesting that detention that is punitive in effect may not necessarily also be punitive in character). Finally, Zagor argues that of the Justices who questioned the "Chu Kheng Lim" test, none were able to provide a coherent alternative to substitute for it.

In nature, "B. sceptrum" grows in deep yellow or pale red sand in tall shrubland, commonly on <a href="sand%20dune">dunes</a>, being found as a shrub to high, though often smaller in exposed areas. It is killed by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">fire</a> and regenerates by <a href="seed">seed</a>, the woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> opening with fire. "B. sceptrum" is one of the most striking yellow-flowered <a href="banksia">banksia</a>s of all. Its tall bright yellow spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are terminal and well displayed. Flowering is in summer, mainly December and January, though flowers are occasionally seen at other times.

"Banksia sceptrum" generally grows as a shrub up to high, though sometimes it reaches . It is many-branched and can reach in diameter. The stocky trunk has smooth or mildly <a href="Tessellation">tessellated</a> pale grey bark. New growth has been recorded in spring and autumn, and may possibly occur over the summer. New branchlets are covered in fine greenish-brown fur and become smooth and pale grey after around two years. The leaves are roughly oblong-shaped with truncate or <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23emarginate">emarginate</a> ends and measure long and wide. They are on long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>. The flat leaf margins have short blunt teeth. The upper and lower surfaces of the leaf are covered in dense fur, but become smooth with age.

The tall flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, arise at the ends of vertical branches over November to January, and can be striking in appearance. They take 6–7 months to develop—longer than other members of the genus. Between high and wide, they are bright yellow and highly prominent. Flower opening (<a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>) takes place over 1–2 weeks, and proceeds up the flower spike. The ageing flowers turn grey and remain on the spike as the woody oval <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop. The infructescence—an old spike bearing follicles—is bulky with a diameter. There are up to 50 follicles on each spike, each long, high and wide. When new they are covered with dense grey fur, which wears off exposed areas.

The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) seed is long and fairly flattened. It is composed of the obovate seed body (containing the <a href="Plant%20embryogenesis">embryonic</a> plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is brown and slightly wrinkled and the other is brown-black and sparkles slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. The first pair of leaves produced by seedlings, known as <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s, are obovate and measure long by wide. The upper leaf margin of the wedge is crinkled. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long.

Swiss botanist <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> described "Banksia sceptrum" in 1855, based on a specimen collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> north of the <a href="Hutt%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Hutt River</a> sometime during 1850 or 1851. The species name "sceptrum" "sceptre" refers to the prominent flower spikes. In <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> based on leaf properties. He placed "B. sceptrum" in the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">"Quercinae"</a>. <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style">style</a> and pollen-presenter characters. "Banksia sceptrum" was placed in section "Orthostylis". In his 1891 work "<a href="Revisio%20Generum%20Plantarum">Revisio Generum Plantarum</a>", German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. sceptrum" as "Sirmuellera sceptrum". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> in 1940.

In his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", Australian botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> placed "B. sceptrum" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike shape, in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight styles, and in <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">"B." ser. "Banksia"</a> because of its robust inflorescence and hairy <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">pistil</a> that is prominently curved before anthesis. He added that its follicles resembled those of "<a href="Banksia%20ornata">Banksia ornata</a>", while the <a href="wikt%3Amuricate">muricate</a> seed body resembled those of "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">B. speciosa</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">B. baxteri</a>", though its obovate, crinkled cotyledons suggested an affinity with the series "Cyrtostylis".

<a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B. sceptrum" in series "Banksia", placing it in <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Cratistylis">"B." subser. "Cratistylis"</a> along with eight other Western Australian species. It was placed as an early offshoot within the group. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series. "B. spectrum"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" according to "Flora of Australia" is as follows:

In 2002, a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> showed "Banksia sceptrum" and "<a href="Banksia%20ashbyi">B. ashbyi</a>" to be each other's closest relatives, the two lying in a larger group made up of the members of the subseries "Cratistylis" plus "<a href="Banksia%20lindleyana">Banksia lindleyana</a>". This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using <a href="chloroplast%20DNA">chloroplast DNA</a> and combining it with earlier results.

Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia" in 2005. They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. sceptrum" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia sceptrum" is found from <a href="Hamelin%20Pool%20Marine%20Nature%20Reserve">Hamelin Pool</a> south to around east of <a href="Geraldton">Geraldton</a> and near <a href="Mullewa%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mullewa</a> and east to Wandana Nature Reserve. The annual rainfall is . The soils it grows on are deep yellow or pale red sands, often on dunes. It is also found on flat areas. Found in tall shrubland, it grows in association with "B. ashbyi", mallee gums, sandplain cypress ("<a href="Actinostrobus%20arenarius">Actinostrobus arenarius</a>") and sandplain woody pear ("<a href="Xylomelum%20angustifolium">Xylomelum angustifolium</a>").

Like many plants in Australia's southwest, "Banksia sceptrum" is adapted to an environment in which <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "Banksia sceptrum" is a reseeder—killed by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> and regenerating by <a href="seed">seed</a>. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower again. If bushfires are too frequent—occurring less than four years apart—they risk eradicating local populations of reseeders.

"B. sceptrum" has been shown to be highly susceptible to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a> from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", like many Western Australian banksias.

An assessment of the potential impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.

"B. sceptrum" is principally used in the cut flower industry, with the immature spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires a <a href="Mediterranean%20Climate">Mediterranean</a> (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. A dwarf form is in cultivation.

PowerBook 100

The PowerBook 100 is a portable <a href="subnotebook">subnotebook</a> <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> that was designed and manufactured by Sony for <a href="Apple%20Inc">Apple Computer</a> and introduced on October 21, 1991, at the <a href="COMDEX">COMDEX</a> <a href="computer%20expo">computer expo</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>. Priced at <a href="US%20Dollar">US$</a>2,300, the PowerBook 100 was the low-end model of the first three simultaneously released <a href="PowerBook">PowerBook</a>s. Its <a href="CPU">CPU</a> and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the <a href="Macintosh%20Portable">Macintosh Portable</a>. It had a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> 16-<a href="megahertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) processor, 2-8 <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a>s (MB) of memory, a <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> backlit <a href="liquid%20crystal%20display">liquid crystal display</a> (LCD) with 640 × 400 <a href="pixel">pixel</a> resolution, and the <a href="System%207">System 7.0.1</a> operating system. It did not have a built-in <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">floppy disk drive</a> and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a <a href="trackball">trackball</a> pointing device in front of the keyboard for ease of use.

Apple's then-chief executive officer (CEO) <a href="John%20Sculley">John Sculley</a> started the PowerBook project in 1990, allocating $1 million for marketing. Despite the small marketing budget, the new PowerBook line was a success, generating over $1 billion in revenue for Apple in its first year. <a href="Sony">Sony</a> designed and manufactured the PowerBook 100 in collaboration with the <a href="Apple%20Industrial%20Design%20Group">Apple Industrial Design Group</a>, Apple's internal design team. It was discontinued on September 3, 1992, and superseded by the <a href="PowerBook%20145">PowerBook 145</a> and <a href="PowerBook%20Duo">PowerBook Duo</a> series. Since then, it has been praised several times for its design; "<a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a>" named the PowerBook 100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time in 2006, and US magazine "Mobile PC" chose the PowerBook 100 as the greatest gadget of all time in 2005.

From 1990, John Sculley, then CEO of Apple, oversaw <a href="product%20development">product development</a> personally to ensure that Apple released new computers to market more quickly. His new strategy was to increase market share by lowering prices and releasing more "hit" products. This strategy contributed to the commercial success of the low-end <a href="Macintosh%20Classic">Macintosh Classic</a> and <a href="Macintosh%20LC">Macintosh LC</a>, desktop computers released by Apple in 1990. Sculley wanted to replicate the success of these products with Apple's new PowerBook line.

Sculley began the project in 1990 and wanted the PowerBook to be released within one year. The project had three managers: John Medica, who managed engineering for the new laptop; Randy Battat, who was the vice president for product marketing; and Neil Selvin, who headed the marketing effort. In 1991, the two leaders in the laptop computer industry were <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> and <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a>, both of which had introduced models weighing less than . Medica, Battat, and Selvin deliberately designed the PowerBook to weigh less than its competitors.

Sculley allocated a $1 million marketing budget to the PowerBook product line, in contrast to the $25 million used to market the <a href="Macintosh%20Classic">Macintosh Classic</a>. Medica, Battat, and Selvin used most of the money to produce and air a television commercial that viewers would remember. Advertising agency <a href="TBWA%20Worldwide">Chiat/Day</a> filmed retired <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> basketball star <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> sitting uncomfortably in a small airline coach seat yet comfortably typing on his PowerBook. The ad caption read: "At least his hands are comfortable."

Apple unveiled the PowerBook 100 on October 21, 1991, at the <a href="COMDEX">Comdex</a> computer expo in Las Vegas, with two other models, the <a href="PowerBook%20140">PowerBook 140</a> and <a href="PowerBook%20170">PowerBook 170</a>. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand in the first three months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1 billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1 billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.

However, the initial popularity of the PowerBook 100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers were willing to pay more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook 100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook 100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as <a href="Price%20Club">Price Club</a>. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).

On September 17, 1992, Apple recalled 60,000 PowerBook 100s because of a potential safety problem. An <a href="short%20circuit">electrical short</a>, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred in three of the 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a>; and the computer was prone to cracks in the <a href="power%20supply">power adapter</a> socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.

Most of the PowerBook 100's internal components were based on its predecessor, the <a href="Macintosh%20Portable">Macintosh Portable</a>. It included a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68HC000</a> 16 MHz processor, had 2 MB memory, no <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">floppy disk drive</a>, and cost approximately $2,300. An external floppy disk drive was available for $279. The dimensions of the PowerBook 100 were an improvement over the Portable. It was deep, wide, and high, compared to the Portable, which was deep, wide and high. Another significant difference was the less expensive <a href="Super-twisted%20nematic%20display">passive matrix</a> display used instead of the sharper <a href="Active-matrix%20liquid%20crystal%20display">active matrix</a> used on the Portable (and the 170). The PowerBook 100 included the <a href="System%207">System 7.0.1</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> as standard, with support for all versions up to <a href="System%207">System 7.5.5</a>. Apple, however, released <a href="System%206">System 6.0.8L</a>, which allowed the PowerBook 100 to run <a href="System%206">System 6</a>. It could also be used with some earlier System 6 versions, although Apple did not officially support this.

The PowerBook 100 had one external serial port, designed for use with a printer or any compatible <a href="RS-422">RS-422</a> device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external <a href="modem">modem</a> port, instead offering an optional built-in <a href="List%20of%20device%20bandwidths%23Modems/Home%20user%20connections">2400 baud</a> modem for communications. As a result, for the first time a user could not print directly and access <a href="AppleTalk">AppleTalk</a> or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.

When the computer was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved as long as the main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook 100 Power Manager was an <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>, usually placed on the <a href="logic%20board">logic board</a> of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of the computer. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's <a href="backlight">backlight</a>, <a href="Hard%20disk%20drive%23Technology">hard drive spin-down</a>, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and <a href="input/output">input/output</a> (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5 V batteries backed up permanent and expansion <a href="random%20access%20memory">random access memory</a> (RAM) when the PowerBook 100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's <a href="RAM%20disk">RAM disk</a> to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.

The PowerBook 100 was the first PowerBook to incorporate <a href="Target%20Disk%20Mode">SCSI Disk Mode</a>, which allowed it to be used as an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.

There are two versions of the PowerBook 100's <a href="QWERTY">QWERTY</a> layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63 keys and an international <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> version with 64 keys. The <a href="caps%20lock">caps lock</a> key on the PowerBook 100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System 7 operating system software includes an <a href="Extension%20%28Mac%20OS%29">extension</a> file that causes an icon of the international caps lock symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the <a href="menu%20bar">menu bar</a> when Caps Lock is active.

Both the PowerBook 140 and 170 were designed before the 100 by the <a href="Apple%20Industrial%20Design%20Group">Apple Industrial Design Group</a>, from March 1990-February 1991. The 100's styling was based on those computers and represents the first improvements to the PowerBook line as Apple benefited from the lessons learned in developing the more powerful models' enclosure. The 100 was designed between September and December 1990, and retained the same design elements, which were a variation on the <a href="Snow%20White%20design%20language">Snow White design language</a> Apple had been using since 1984. Specifically, raised ridges spaced apart intended to tie it into the existing product line.

Apple approached Sony in late 1989 because it did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a> from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by <a href="Sony">Sony</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13 months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook 100 top priority. Sony president <a href="Norio%20Ohga">Norio Ohga</a> gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.

<a href="Robert%20Brunner">Robert Brunner</a>, Apple's head of industrial design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook "so it would be as easy to use and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were <a href="beige">beige</a> or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed in the middle of the computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a <a href="fashion%20statement">fashion statement</a> with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".

Crystal Waters of "Home Office Computing" praised the PowerBook 100's "unique, effective design" but was disappointed because the internal modem did not receive faxes, and the 100 had no monitor port. The low-capacity 20 MB hard drive was also criticized. Once a user's core applications had been installed, little room was left for optional programs and documents. Waters concluded: "Having used the 100 constantly in the past few weeks, I know I wouldn't feel cheated by buying it - if only it had a 40MB hard-disk drive option."

"<a href="eWeek">PC Week</a>" <a href="benchmark%20%28computing%29">benchmark</a>ed the PowerBook 100, measuring it against its predecessor, the <a href="Macintosh%20Portable">Macintosh Portable</a>. The PowerBook 100 took 5.3 seconds to open a <a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a> document and 2.5 seconds to save it. The Portable took 5.4 and 2.6 seconds respectively. "PC Week" tested the battery life, which delivered 3 hours 47 minutes of use. "<a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">Byte magazine</a>"s review concluded, "The PowerBook 100 is recommended for word processing and communications tasks; the higher-end products offer enough power for complex reports, large spreadsheets and professional graphics." "<a href="MacWEEK">MacWEEK</a>" described it as "ideal for writers and others on a tight budget."

The PowerBook 100 continues to receive recognition from the press. "<a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a>" named the PowerBook 100 the 10th-greatest PC of all time in 2006, and in 2005, US magazine "Mobile PC" chose the PowerBook 100 as the greatest gadget of all time, ahead of the <a href="Sony%20Walkman">Sony Walkman</a> and <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>. The PowerBook 100 received multiple awards for its design, including the 1999 IDSA Silver Design of the Decade Award, "Form" magazine's 1993 Designer's Design Awards, the 1992 ISDA Gold Industrial Design Excellence Award, the 1992 Appliance Manufacturer Excellence in Design award, and the Industry Forum Design 10 Best - Hannover Fair award.

Agharta is a 1975 live <a href="double%20album">double album</a> by American <a href="jazz">jazz</a> trumpeter, composer, and bandleader <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>. By the time he recorded the album, Davis was 48 years old and had alienated many in the jazz community while attracting younger <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> audiences with his radical electric <a href="jazz%20fusion">fusion</a> music. After experimenting with different line-ups, he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years, despite physical pain from worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse. During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the <a href="Festival%20Hall%2C%20Osaka">Festival Hall</a> in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> on February 1; the afternoon show produced "Agharta" and the evening show was released as "<a href="Pangaea%20%28album%29">Pangaea</a>" the following year.

Davis led a <a href="septet">septet</a> at the concert; saxophonist <a href="Sonny%20Fortune">Sonny Fortune</a>, bassist <a href="Michael%20Henderson">Michael Henderson</a>, and guitarist <a href="Pete%20Cosey">Pete Cosey</a> were given space to improvise against a dense backdrop of <a href="riff%20%28music%29">riffs</a>, electronic effects, <a href="cross-beat">cross-beat</a>s, and <a href="funk">funk</a> <a href="groove%20%28music%29">grooves</a> from the <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a>—drummer <a href="Al%20Foster">Al Foster</a>, guitarist <a href="Reggie%20Lucas">Reggie Lucas</a>, and percussionist <a href="James%20Mtume">James Mtume</a>. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a> played on his <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah</a> processed trumpet, and <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drone</a>s from an accompanying <a href="electronic%20organ">electronic organ</a>. The evolving nature of the performance led to the widespread misunderstanding that it had no compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the bandleader's emotional and spiritual state at the time.

"Agharta" was first released in Japan by <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment%20Japan">CBS/Sony</a> in August 1975 just before Davis temporarily retired due to increasingly poor health and exhaustion. At the record label's suggestion, it was titled after <a href="Agharta">the legendary subterranean city</a>. Davis enlisted Japanese artist <a href="Tadanori%20Yokoo">Tadanori Yokoo</a> to design its artwork, which depicted the cityscape of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by <a href="Eastern%20world">Eastern</a> subterranean myths and <a href="Afrofuturism">Afrofuturism</a>. An alternate cover was produced for its 1976 release in North America by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>.

A highly divisive record, "Agharta" further challenged Davis' jazz audience and was widely panned by contemporary critics; reviewers found the music discordant, and complained of Cosey's loud guitar sounds and Davis' sparse trumpet playing. It was reevaluated positively in subsequent years, while a generation of younger musicians was influenced by the band's abrasive music and cathartic playing, particularly Cosey's <a href="effects%20unit">effects</a>-laden <a href="free%20improvisation">free improvisation</a>s. "Agharta" became viewed as an important jazz-rock record, a dramatically dynamic group performance, and the culmination of Davis' <a href="Electric%20Miles">electric period</a> spanning the late 1960s and mid-1970s.

In the early 1970s, Miles Davis continued exploring directions radically different from the jazz music that made him renowned in the 1950s and 1960s. The music from this in his career found him experimenting with <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="Rhythm%20in%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa">African rhythms</a>, emerging <a href="Music%20technology%20%28electronic%20and%20digital%29">electronic music technology</a>, and an ever-changing lineup of musicians who played electric instruments. The trumpeter attracted younger audiences as his <a href="jazz%20fusion">fusion</a> music became more radical and abstract while alienating older listeners, musicians, and critics in the jazz scene who accused him of <a href="selling%20out">selling out</a>. After recording his 1972 "<a href="On%20the%20Corner">On the Corner</a>" album, Davis began to focus more on performing live, working in the studio only sporadically and haphazardly; the 1974 releases "<a href="Big%20Fun%20%28Miles%20Davis%20album%29">Big Fun</a>" and "<a href="Get%20Up%20with%20It">Get Up with It</a>" compiled recordings he made between 1969 and 1974. 

By 1973, Davis had established most of his band's line-up, a <a href="septet">septet</a> featuring bassist <a href="Michael%20Henderson">Michael Henderson</a>, guitarists <a href="Pete%20Cosey">Pete Cosey</a> and <a href="Reggie%20Lucas">Reggie Lucas</a>, drummer <a href="Al%20Foster">Al Foster</a>, percussionist <a href="James%20Mtume">James Mtume</a>, and saxophonist <a href="Dave%20Liebman">Dave Liebman</a>; Liebman left the group the following year and was replaced by <a href="Sonny%20Fortune">Sonny Fortune</a>. Lucas, Foster, and Mtume functioned as the band's <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a>, while Cosey, Henderson, and Fortune were given space to improvise as soloists. Their concerts—played frequently at rock venues and festivals—became opportunities for Davis and his sidemen to test new musical ideas and ways to exploit electronic equipment.

Davis toured relentlessly for two years while tolerating intense physical pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from <a href="sickle-cell%20anaemia">sickle-cell anaemia</a>, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a> in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed <a href="Vocal%20fold%20nodule">nodules</a> on his <a href="larynx">larynx</a> that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on <a href="self-medication">self-medicating</a> with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drug use</a> led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in "<a href="DownBeat">DownBeat</a>" magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. "He was like the general looking at the fort and they had a moat and we were going to get in that fort", Henderson later said. "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway."

In 1975, the 48-year old Davis embarked on a three-week tour of Japan. Between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said at the time that Davis was leading his "magnificent and energetic" band just as <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> had his orchestra. "Miles must be "the" genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent", Takada concluded. 

Throughout the tour, Davis was sick with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and <a href="effects%20pedals">effects pedals</a> because of the pain in his legs, he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of <a href="Heineken">Heineken</a> beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the <a href="Festival%20Hall%2C%20Osaka">Festival Hall</a> in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>. "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers."

The Festival Hall performances were recorded by Japan's <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment%20Japan">CBS/Sony</a> record label under the supervision of <a href="Teo%20Macero">Teo Macero</a>, Davis' producer of 15 years. Unlike with his previous electric albums, Macero abstained from editing and splicing the recordings. As he later told "<a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">Musician</a>" magazine, "the Japanese specifically wanted me to leave in the spacy things." They were released as two <a href="double%20album">double album</a>s—"Agharta", featuring the afternoon concert, was first released in Japan in August 1975 and later in North America in 1976; the evening show was issued in Japan as "<a href="Pangaea%20%28album%29">Pangaea</a>" in 1976.

For the first of the afternoon concert's two <a href="set%20list">sets</a>, the band performed the compositions "Tatu", "Agharta Prelude", and "Maiysha" (from "Get Up with It"), making up "Agharta"s first disc of music. The second-set performances of "Right Off" (from Davis' 1971 "<a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28album%29">Jack Johnson</a>" album), "Ife" (from "Big Fun"), and "Wili (= For Dave)" spanned the second disc; between the "Right Off" and "Ife" segments, the band improvised a passage based on "<a href="So%20What%20%28Miles%20Davis%20composition%29">So What</a>" (from the 1959 album "<a href="Kind%20of%20Blue">Kind of Blue</a>") for 41 seconds after Henderson started to play its <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a>. The pieces were performed in <a href="List%20of%20musical%20medleys">medleys</a>, which were given generic track titles on "Agharta", such as "Prelude" and "Interlude". As with his other live releases in the 1970s, Davis refused to have individual compositions specified in the track listing because he felt critics and other listeners often overlooked the music's intrinsic meaning by indulging in abstract <a href="musical%20analysis">musical analysis</a>. "I'm not doing anything, it doesn't need an explanation", he later told <a href="Leonard%20Feather">Leonard Feather</a>. Music scholars were able to identify the pieces through an examination of what Davis researcher Enrico Merlin called "coded <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a>", which Davis played on trumpet or organ to signify the end of one segment and direct the band toward the next section. He first used such cues and <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulations</a> when recording "<a href="Flamenco%20Sketches">Flamenco Sketches</a>" in 1959, Merlin said.

The pieces featured on "Agharta" were part of a typical set list for the group, but their performances of each sometimes changed almost beyond recognition from concert to concert. This, along with the track names, led to the widespread misunderstanding that the music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured. Lucas explained that the band started each performance with a "very defined compositional basis" before developing it further in a highly structured yet "very free way"; the "Right Off" segment was improvised from the original recording's <a href="E-flat%20major">E-flat</a> riff. Davis had the band play around a single <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chord</a> in a piece for several minutes with <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variations</a> as each member performed in a different <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>; Foster might have been playing in <a href="common%20time">common time</a> and Mtume in <a href="compound%20duple%20metre">compound duple metre</a> or <a href="septuple%20meter">septuple time</a>, while the guitarists would <a href="comping">comp</a> in another tempo altogether. "That's a lot of intricate shit we were working off this one chord", Davis remarked. From Lucas' perspective, this kind of "structured improvisation" resulted in significant interplay between the rhythm section and allowed the band to improvise "a lot more than just the notes that were being played in the solos; we were improvising the entire song as we went along."

Like "Pangaea" and "<a href="Dark%20Magus">Dark Magus</a>"—the two other albums showcasing the septet—"Agharta" revealed what <a href="Amiri%20Baraka">Amiri Baraka</a> described as Davis' affinity for <a href="Minimal%20music">minimalism</a>. He abandoned melodic and harmonic conventions in favor of riffs, <a href="cross-rhythm">cross-rhythm</a>s, and funk <a href="groove%20%28music%29">grooves</a> as a backdrop for soloists to improvise throughout. Davis had preferred understated compositions throughout his career but by the mid 1970s he showed a deeper embrace of rhythm, inspired by <a href="Afrocentricism">Afrocentric</a> politics. When Mtume and Cosey joined the band, his live music lost most of its "European sensibilities" and "settled down into a deep African thing, a deep African-American groove" emphasizing rhythm and drums rather than individual solos, Davis said, although he did not completely reject melody. "We ain't in Africa, and we don't play just chants. There's some theory under what we do." <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a>, who categorized "Agharta" as a jazz-rock record, wrote in "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>" that the music "offered a drastic intensification of rock's three most radical aspects: space, <a href="timbre">timbre</a>, and groove". In <a href="Martha%20Bayles">Martha Bayles</a>' opinion, it drew from jazz only in its element of <a href="free%20improvisation">free improvisation</a> and from rock only in its use of electronics and "ear-bleeding volume". The album also showcased Davis' <a href="Avant-garde%20music">avant-garde</a> impulses and exploration of <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> sounds. According to <a href="Greg%20Tate">Greg Tate</a>, the septet created "a pan-ethnic web of avant-garde music", while <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a>'s Hernan M. Campbell said they explored "progressive ambiences" particularly within the record's second half; Phil Alexander from "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" characterized "Agharta" as "both ambient yet thrashing, melodic yet coruscating", and suggestive of <a href="Karlheinz%20Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>'s electronic experiments.

During the concert, Davis directed approximately 50 stops or <a href="Break%20%28music%29">breaks</a> to the band, particularly the rhythm section, by gesturing with his head or hand. These stops served as dramatic turning points in the <a href="tension%20%28music%29">tension-release</a> structure of the performances, changing their tempo and allowing the band to alternate between quiet passages and intense climaxes. He also interjected the performances with <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drone</a> washes from his <a href="Yamaha">Yamaha</a> organ, achieving a "strange, nearly perverse presence" that <a href="Mikal%20Gilmore">Mikal Gilmore</a> believed "defined the temper" of the music. Lucas said Davis applied a feel for <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> he had developed earlier in his career playing jazz but with a greater array of <a href="contrast%20%28music%29">contrasts</a>, including <a href="atonality">atonal</a>, dissonant chords, and his own <a href="bebop">bebop</a> trumpet playing set against the group's funk rhythms. "Extreme <a href="Texture%20%28music%29">textures</a> and extreme volume", Lucas explained, "were as much part of the palette as the contrasting chord and rhythmic structures. Being equipped like a full rock band, we sometimes literally blew the walls out." During the "Tatu" and "Agharta Prelude" segments, Davis abruptly stopped and started the septet several times to shift tempos by playing a dissonant, cacophonous organ figure, giving Cosey space to generate eccentric, <a href="psychedelic%20music">psychedelic</a> figures and effects. The main theme for "Tatu" had been played at a slower tempo when Cosey first joined the band, but they played it faster as their rapport grew, especially by the time of the Japanese tour. Cosey credited Davis with having the ability to "transmit thoughts and ideas" to the soloists with his playing.

The rhythmic direction of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a <a href="ring%20modulator">ring modulator</a> and an <a href="EMS%20Synthi%20A">EMS Synthi A</a>. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain <a href="soundscape">soundscape</a> during each performance, "whether we were in space, or underwater or a group of Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a <a href="mbira">mbira</a>, <a href="claves">claves</a>, <a href="agogo%20bells">agogo bells</a>, and several other <a href="hand%20percussion">hand percussion</a> instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. "I would hit them just like they do at [boxing] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the "Ife" segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him "see what you can do with it." Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phase shifters</a> such as the <a href="Mu-Tron%23Mu-tron%20Bi-Phase">Mu-Tron Bi-Phase</a>, creating a sound he said was "total tapestry".

Unlike Davis' previous recordings, the <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a>s throughout "Agharta" were mostly played by Fortune and Cosey. Fortune alternated between soprano and alto saxophones and the flute, performing with a "substance and structure" Gilmore believed was very much indebted to <a href="John%20Coltrane">John Coltrane</a> during his "<a href="A%20Love%20Supreme">A Love Supreme</a>" (1965) period. He performed his longest alto saxophone solo on "Right Off", which opened the record's second disc in a "propulsive" segment Gilmore said "flies by like a train ride in a dream, where scenes flash past the window in a fascinating and illusive dream". Cosey played a <a href="Guild%20S-100">Guild S-100</a> electric guitar and heavily employed <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a>, <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>, and <a href="Audio%20feedback">feedback</a> in his improvisations on "Agharta". He alternated between several effects pedals set up underneath his table of percussion instruments, including a <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">fuzzbox</a> for distorting guitar sounds and two different <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah pedal</a>s he used during solos or when playing more mellow <a href="Tone%20%28musical%20instrument%29">tones</a>. Cosey often arranged his guitar strings in different places on the <a href="fretboard">fretboard</a> and never played in <a href="standard%20tuning">standard tuning</a>, using at least 36 different <a href="tuning%20system">tuning system</a>s, each of which altered the style and sound of his playing. According to <a href="Tzvi%20Gluckin">Tzvi Gluckin</a> from "<a href="Premier%20Guitar">Premier Guitar</a>", his experimental guitar playing was rooted in the <a href="blues">blues</a> and displayed a sense of <a href="musical%20phrasing">phrasing</a> that was aggressive and "blistering" yet "somehow also restrained", particularly in his control of feedback.

Davis had enlisted Cosey to provide his music with sounds from the <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a> and <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, whose use of distortion and the <a href="E-flat%20tuning">E-flat tuning</a> was shared by Cosey. According to <a href="Charles%20Shaar%20Murray">Charles Shaar Murray</a>, he evoked the guitarist's echoic, <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a>-inspired solos while Lucas performed in the manner of Hendrix's more lyrical <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> songs; Cosey's guitar was separated to the left <a href="audio%20channel">channel</a> and Lucas' to the right on "Agharta". Jazz scholar Stuart Nicholson wrote that Davis utilized his guitarists in a way which realized the "waves of <a href="harmonic%20distortion">harmonic distortion</a>" Hendrix had explored in his own music. In Murray's view, the album invoked his influence on the trumpeter more explicitly than any other of his records; Nicholson considered it to be the "closest approximation" to the music they could have recorded together. Davis veered from succinct and expressive solos to unsentimental wails, which suggested he was still mourning <a href="Death%20of%20Jimi%20Hendrix">Hendrix's 1970 death</a>, Murray surmised. That year, Davis had started playing with a wah-wah pedal affixed to his trumpet in order to emulate the <a href="register%20%28music%29">register</a> Hendrix achieved on his guitar. The pedal created what "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Jazz">The Penguin Guide to Jazz</a>" (2006) described as "surges and ebbs in a harmonically static line, allowing Miles to build huge melismatic variations on a single note". By the time of the concert, he had developed what Philip Freeman called "a new tone, the wiggly, shimmering ribbons of sound that are heard on "Agharta"", where his wah-wah processed solos often sounded frantic and melancholic, like "twisted streams of raw pain".
Davis played his trumpet sparsely throughout the concert, often sounding obscured by the rhythm section. His presence on "Agharta" reflected what <a href="John%20Szwed">John Szwed</a> called "the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death". Drawing on <a href="Theodor%20W.%20Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a>'s commentary of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>'s late works, Szwed said "the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful." After Lucas' first and only solo of the show climaxed the "Ife" segment, Davis introduced "Wili (= For Dave)" with a few organ chords, culminating in Cosey's final solo and a trumpet passage by Davis, which <a href="Paul%20Tingen">Paul Tingen</a> characterized as plaintive and introspective. According to him, live music shows typically developed toward reaching a final climax, but Davis' concerts "often dissolved into entropy". On "Agharta", Tingen observed a "deep sadness" hanging over the music as the energy of the "Wili (= For Dave)" piece "slowly drained away" to the record's <a href="Fade%20%28audio%20engineering%29">fade out</a>.

"Agharta"s title was proposed by CBS/Sony as a reference to <a href="Agharta">the subterranean utopian city</a>. The city's legend was one of several <a href="Eastern%20world">Eastern</a> versions of the <a href="Hollow%20Earth">Hollow Earth</a> theory proposing that an ancient <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a> originally lived on the Earth's surface but was forced to flee below because of some political or geological crisis. The myth depicted the city as a divine source of power, claiming that its inhabitants were highly spiritual, advanced beings who would save the Earth from materialism and destructive technology after a cataclysmic event. It was first conceived by 19th-century French thinker <a href="Louis%20Jacolliot">Louis Jacolliot</a> as a land ruled by an <a href="Aethiopia">Ethiopian</a> ruler; <a href="Alexandre%20Saint-Yves%20d%27Alveydre">Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre</a> later described it as "drowning in celestial radiances all visible distinctions of race in a single chromatic of light and sound, singularly removed from the usual notions of perspective and acoustics."

The album's artwork was designed by Japanese artist <a href="Tadanori%20Yokoo">Tadanori Yokoo</a>, who had been creating silkscreen prints on themes of Agharta and the mythical kingdom of <a href="Shambhala">Shambhala</a> the year before the Festival Hall concert; his design for <a href="Carlos%20Santana">Carlos Santana</a>'s "<a href="Lotus%20%28Santana%20album%29">Lotus</a>" (1974) featured such themes. In the early 1970s, Yokoo had found his growing popularity in Japan distracting and moved to the United States, where he was able to get more of his work published. After returning to Japan, he received a phone call from Davis, who had seen his art and wanted him to create a cover for "Agharta". Before designing the cover, Yokoo listened to a preliminary tape of the concert, meditated, and reflected on his reading of <a href="Raymond%20W.%20Bernard">Raymond W. Bernard</a>'s 1969 book "The Hollow Earth". Bernard had written that the city existed in a large cavern in the center of the Earth, while Yokoo said he believed "Agharta could be down there under the sea like <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> or even hidden in the jungle like the lost city of <a href="El%20Dorado">El Dorado</a>." He also drew on elements from other Eastern subterranean myths and <a href="Afrofuturism">Afrofuturism</a> in his design. Critics who eventually saw the album's packaging thought he had been inspired instead by the <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>s popular at the time.
The front cover depicted an advanced civilization with a vast landscape of skyscrapers and red, sunburst-like flames rising out of the cityscape as representations of Agharta's power. Yokoo used a combination of collage, airbrushing, and painting techniques as he had with his previous work, along with postcards collected from his trips to <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> and New York City; the cityscape on the front cover was taken from one of his postcards. The back cover showed the city submerged in water, embedded in coral reefs, and hovered over by a diver, fish, and a squid ascending from the city. According to graphic designers <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a> and <a href="Aubrey%20Powell%20%28designer%29">Aubrey Powell</a>, Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish, coral reefs, and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis. The foreground of the back cover's illustration featured a reptilian creature. Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about <a href="Lemuria%20%28continent%29">Lemuria</a>; this mythological continent supposedly existed during Earth's prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization, later forced under the Earth's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a <a href="flood%20myth">great flood</a>.

A <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFO</a> was depicted on the back cover, flying in a spotlight over Agharta, while the album's inside packaging featured images of winged superhuman beings known as the Agharta supermen, who guarded the city's entrances and secret tunnels. An inscription in the LP's <a href="gatefold">gatefold sleeve</a> explained the connection between the UFO and the Agharta supermen: "During various periods in history the supermen of Agharta came to the surface of Earth to teach the human race how to live together in peace and save us from wars, catastrophe, and destruction. The apparent sighting of several flying saucers soon after the <a href="bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">bombing of Hiroshima</a> may represent one visitation."

"Agharta"s 1976 North American release had different artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened to at the highest possible volume, and the <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s were credited to Davis. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about the trumpeter being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing that none of the music sounded as if it had been arranged.
"Agharta" was originally panned by the majority of professional critics. According to <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, it became the most widely criticized of Davis' double albums in the 1970s. "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%28newspaper%29">The Stranger</a>"s Dave Segal claimed it was one of the most divisive records ever, challenging both critics and the artist's core audience much in the same way <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a>'s "<a href="Metal%20Machine%20Music">Metal Machine Music</a>" album had in 1975. 

Reviewing the album for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" in 1976, <a href="Robert%20Palmer%20%28writer%29">Robert Palmer</a> said it is marred by long stretches of "sloppy, one-chord jams", disjointed sounds, and a banal quality clearly rendered by the impeccable Japanese engineering. He complained that Davis' use of the wah-wah pedal inhibited his ability to phrase notes and that the septet sounded poor "by rock standards", particularly Cosey, whose overamplified guitar "whined and rumbled like a noisy machine shop" and relegated Lucas to background riffs. "<a href="Jazz%20Forum%20%28magazine%29">Jazz Forum</a>" critic <a href="Andrzej%20Trzaskowski">Andrzej Trzaskowski</a> wrote that Fortune seemed to be the only jazz musician on the record, finding his solos often flawless while disparaging the performances of Davis, Lucas, and Cosey, whose guitar and synthesizer effects he found pointlessly brutal. In Trzaskowski's opinion, the individual segments did not cohere as a whole and were further hampered by the clichéd "rock phraseology" of the guitarists, who he said lacked wit, harmony, and taste. Jazz critic <a href="Ian%20Carr">Ian Carr</a> thought Davis' trumpet sounded fatigued, dejected, and out of place with the band's intense rhythms and monotonously noisy guitars; in general, he deemed the music "too non-<a href="Western%20culture">Western</a> in the sense of too much rhythm and not enough structure". <a href="Gary%20Giddins">Gary Giddins</a> penned an angrily dismissive review of "Agharta" for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", in which he charged Davis with failing to assert his musical presence on the terribly "sad" record. A few days after it was published, he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs, industrial-strength scouring pads, and a card that read, "The next time you review Miles Davis clean out your head."

"Agharta" received some positive contemporary reviews. Nathan Cobb from "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" appraised the record favorably in 1976, calling it "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" with a "positively cosmic" rhythmic foundation. In conclusion, he regarded Davis as "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In "DownBeat", Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. He rated the album four stars, out of a possible five. <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a> found "Agharta" too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in "<a href="Phonograph%20Record%20%28magazine%29">Phonograph Record</a>" that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous "emotional capacities" having been shattered by "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that "the soul beyond it" could never be destroyed and interestingly "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; and that, that which is all that is left, is merely the universe".

The concert itself was received enthusiastically by the Osaka audience. "I had no idea what [they] were going to do", Henderson recalled. "They gave us a standing ovation that was almost as long as the concert." The music translated poorly to the commercial marketplace, however—ill-suited for "FM airplay, dancing, or passive listening", in Nicholson's words. The album's only appearance on a popular music chart was in April 1976 on the American <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" chart</a>, where it spent five weeks and reached a peak position of 168.

By the time of the second Osaka concert (captured on "Pangaea"), the band's level of energy had diminished significantly, and Davis sounded particularly absent. As Mtume recounted, "he became ill in the evening, and you can hear the difference in the energy." Upon returning from Japan, the trumpeter fell ill again and was hospitalized for three months. He held a few more shows and studio sessions with the band, but his health worsened; their last show on September 5, 1975, in <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> ended abruptly when Davis left the stage and began to cry in pain. He retired soon after—citing physical, spiritual, and creative exhaustion—and lived as a recluse for the next several years, often struggling with bouts of depression and further medical treatment, before resuming his recording career in 1980. He abandoned the direction he had pursued in the 1970s, instead playing a style of fusion far more melodic and accessible to audiences, until his death in 1991. The day after he died, Prague's <a href="Wenceslas%20Square">Wenceslas Square</a> saw the opening of the AghaRTA Jazz Centrum, a small jazz club named after the album, hosting nightly performances and an annual festival played by local and international acts. 
"Agharta" has undergone positive critical reassessment, beginning in 1980 when Davis returned to the jazz scene. Of the albums documenting his 1973–75 band, it was considered by many critics to be the best, in retrospect. For Giddins, it had become one of his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. "There really is not a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", he later said. Davis biographer <a href="Jack%20Chambers%20%28linguist%29">Jack Chambers</a> believed it proved far better than most of his other electric albums; the "Maiysha" and "Jack Johnson" segments in particular "magically brought into focus the musical forces over which many thought Davis had lost control". In "" (1981), Christgau saw it as his finest music since "Jack Johnson", an "angry, dissociated, funky" record built on the septet's virtuosic performance, particularly Foster's "guileless show of chops" and Fortune's performance, which he deemed the best <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind</a> playing on a Davis album from this decade. Reflecting on the trumpeter's 1970s concert recordings in "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" (1992), <a href="J.%20D.%20Considine">J. D. Considine</a> contended that "Agharta"s "alternately audacious, poetic, hypnotic, and abrasive" music had endured the passage of time best. 

Although Davis' use of wah-wah was frequently dismissed in the past as a failed experiment, <a href="Richard%20Cook%20%28journalist%29">Richard Cook</a> and <a href="Brian%20Morton%20%28Scottish%20writer%29">Brian Morton</a> believed the effects pedal had in fact helped Davis achieve remarkably adventurous playing on "Agharta". Cook named it among Davis' best works and the culmination of the music he had begun to explore on "<a href="Bitches%20Brew">Bitches Brew</a>" (1970). While possessing an "epic" sound and scope, "Agharta" was also "a great band record", in his opinion: "Even though Davis contributed only telling details, he still cued exceptional performances from his men." In Tingen's mind, it represented the "high plateau" of Davis' electric explorations; because he had given the band leeway for constant interplay, the music exhibited an "organic and fluid quality", with a greater variety of textures, rhythms, timbres, and moods than "Dark Magus". <a href="Henry%20Kaiser%20%28musician%29">Henry Kaiser</a> called it the best ensemble performance of jazz's electric era, and Steve Holtje, writing in "<a href="MusicHound">MusicHound Jazz</a>" (1998), credited Davis with <a href="conducting">conducting</a> the album's "heroes" to sculpt "moments of shattering beauty and soul-rending vehemence".

Despite being one of Davis' lesser-known records, "Agharta" belonged to a period in his career that influenced artists in <a href="British%20jazz">British jazz</a>, <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave</a>, and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>, including guitarists <a href="Robert%20Quine">Robert Quine</a> and <a href="Tom%20Verlaine">Tom Verlaine</a>. It inspired a generation of musicians to focus on cathartic playing rather than precise instrumentation and composition. Quine was particularly fascinated by Cosey's electric guitar sounds; Bangs, who attended Quine's performance with <a href="Richard%20Hell%20and%20the%20Voidoids">the Voidoids</a> in 1977, claimed "he steals from "Agharta"! And makes it "work"!" Other writers later lauded the quality and originality of Cosey's playing on the album, viewing it as a standard for guitar mastery and contrast. Jazz critic <a href="Bill%20Milkowski">Bill Milkowski</a> credited his excursive style for "spawning an entire school of 'sick' guitar playing" and said the combination of Fortune's acerbic sax lines atop Foster, Henderson, and Lucas' syncopated grooves were 10 years ahead of <a href="Steve%20Coleman">Steve Coleman</a> and <a href="Greg%20Osby">Greg Osby</a>'s <a href="M-Base">M-Base</a> experiments. Tingen found Cosey's solos amazingly revealing and ahead of their time when heard decades later: "Sometimes growling, scurrying around all corners like a caged tiger, sometimes soaring like a bird, sometimes deliriously abstract, sometimes elegantly melodic and tender, his electric guitar concept is one of the most original to have been devised on the instrument." In Christgau's opinion, the noises he produced on the first track's second half "comprise some of the greatest free improvisations ever heard in a 'jazz'-'rock' context."

According to Nicholson, "Agharta" and other jazz-rock recordings such as "<a href="Emergency%21%20%28album%29">Emergency!</a>" (1970) by <a href="the%20Tony%20Williams%20Lifetime">the Tony Williams Lifetime</a> suggested the genre was progressing toward "a whole new musical language ... a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of <a href="1980s%20in%20jazz">jazz in the 1980s</a>, although "Agharta" remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental rock</a> genre. It became one of the favorite albums for English musician <a href="Richard%20H.%20Kirk">Richard H. Kirk</a>, who recalled playing the record often while working at <a href="Chris%20Watson%20%28musician%29">Chris Watson</a>'s loft during their early years in the band <a href="Cabaret%20Voltaire%20%28band%29">Cabaret Voltaire</a>. "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>". Along with "On the Corner", it was also a major influence on the <a href="Beastie%20Boys">Beastie Boys</a>' 1994 album "<a href="Ill%20Communication">Ill Communication</a>". In 1998, composer and bandleader <a href="David%20Sanford%20%28composer%29">David Sanford</a> completed his <a href="dissertation">dissertation</a> on "Agharta" as a doctoral student in composition at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the "fringes of jazz" and a place most other music has not explored since. In the "<a href="All%20Music%20Guide%20to%20Jazz">All Music Guide to Jazz</a>" (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album inarguably the "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" and declared, "there is simply nothing like "Agharta" in the canon of recorded music."

The album has been reissued several times. In January 1991, Columbia re-released it in the U.S. on CD format, featuring a <a href="remaster">remaster</a> Tingen deemed inferior to the original LP in sound and <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mix</a> quality. "Had the CD been my first introduction, I might never have liked the album much", he said. Sony later remastered "Agharta" again as part of their Davis reissue campaign and Master Sound series in Japan, with improved sound using <a href="Super%20Bit%20Mapping">Super Bit Mapping</a>. This 1996 Japanese CD edition restored nine additional minutes of atmospheric feedback, percussion, and synthesizer sounds to the end of the final track. 

Another remaster of the album was engineered by Mark Wilder and Maria Triana at New York's Battery Studios. It was made available in the U.S. in 2009, when "Agharta" was one of 52 albums re-issued in <a href="mini-LP">mini-LP</a> replica sleeves as a part of "", a box set commissioned by <a href="Legacy%20Recordings">Sony Legacy</a>. According to Tingen, this edition sounded "like a woolen blanket has been lifted from the previous CD", clarifying especially Cosey, who had sounded muted in the mix. He still found it somewhat low on bass, which he attributed to the original master tapes: "The LP version also didn't have a lot of bass, but I always assumed this was due to the LP cut: with long album lengths the grooves can hold less bass information."

King Island emu

The King Island emu ("Dromaius novaehollandiae minor") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of <a href="emu">emu</a> that was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to <a href="King%20Island%2C%20Tasmania">King Island</a>, in the <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> between mainland Australia and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Its closest relative may be the extinct <a href="Tasmanian%20emu">Tasmanian emu</a> ("D. n. diemenensis"), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may be an example of <a href="insular%20dwarfism">insular dwarfism</a>. The King Island emu was the smallest of all known emus, and had darker <a href="plumage">plumage</a> than the mainland emu. It was black and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive <a href="Kangaroo%20Island%20emu">Kangaroo Island emu</a> ("D. n. baudinianus") in a number of <a href="osteological">osteological</a> details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubated</a> by both parents.

Europeans discovered the King Island emu in 1802 during early expeditions to the island, and most of what is known about the bird in life comes from an interview French naturalist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20P%C3%A9ron">François Péron</a> conducted with a <a href="seal%20hunting">sealer</a> there, as well as depictions by artist <a href="Charles%20Alexandre%20Lesueur">Charles Alexandre Lesueur</a>. They had arrived on King Island in 1802 with <a href="Baudin%20expedition%20to%20Australia">Nicolas Baudin's expedition</a>, and in 1804 several live and stuffed King and Kangaroo Island emus were sent to France. The two live King Island specimens were kept in the <a href="Jardin%20des%20Plantes">Jardin des Plantes</a>, and the remains of these and the other birds are scattered throughout various museums in Europe today. The logbooks of the expedition did not specify from which island each captured bird originated, or even that they were <a href="taxonomically">taxonomically</a> distinct, so their status remained unclear until more than a century later. Hunting pressure and fires started by early settlers on King Island likely drove the wild population to extinction by 1805. The captive specimens in Paris both died in 1822 and are believed to have been the last of their kind.

There was long confusion regarding the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> status and geographic origin of the small island emu taxa from <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a> and <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>, since specimens of both populations were transported to France as part of the same <a href="French%20expedition%20to%20Australia">French expedition to Australia</a> in the early 1800s. The logbooks of the expedition failed to clearly state where and when the small emu individuals were collected, and this has resulted in a plethora of <a href="scientific%20names">scientific names</a> subsequently being coined for either bird, many on questionable grounds, and the idea that all specimens had originated from Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, in 1914, L. Brasil argued the expedition did not encounter emus on King Island, because the weather had been too bad for them to leave their camp. The French also referred to both emus and <a href="cassowaries">cassowaries</a> as "casoars" at the time, which has led to further confusion.

The French naturalist <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> coined the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> "Dromaius ater" in 1817. Various collectors found <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> emu remains on King Island during the early 20th century, the first by the Australian amateur ornithologist <a href="Archibald%20James%20Campbell">Archibald James Campbell</a> in 1903, near a lagoon on the east coast. In 1906, the Australian ornithologist <a href="Walter%20Baldwin%20Spencer">Walter Baldwin Spencer</a> coined the name "Dromaius minor" based on some <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island. The Australian ornithologist <a href="William%20Vincent%20Legge">William Vincent Legge</a> also coined a name for these remains in 1906, "Dromaius bassi", but at a later date. In his 1907 book "<a href="Extinct%20Birds%20%28Rothschild%20book%29">Extinct Birds</a>", the British zoologist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name "D. ater" was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27Histoire%20naturelle">Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle</a> of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of his new species "Dromaius peroni", named after the French naturalist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20P%C3%A9ron">François Péron</a>, who is the main source of information about the bird in life.

The Australian amateur ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> coined further names in the early 1910s, including a new <a href="genus">genus</a> name, "Peronista", as he believed the King and Kangaroo Island birds were generically distinct from the mainland emu. Later writers claimed that the subfossil remains found on King and Kangaroo Islands were not discernibly different, and that they therefore belonged to the same <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. In 1959, the French ornithologist <a href="Christian%20Jouanin">Christian Jouanin</a> proposed that none of the skins were actually from Kangaroo Island, after inspecting expedition and museum documents. In 1990, Jouanin and the French palaeontologist <a href="Jean-Christophe%20Balouet">Jean-Christophe Balouet</a> used environmental <a href="forensics">forensics</a> to demonstrate that the mounted skin in Paris came from King Island, and that at least one live bird had been brought from each island. All scientific names given to the <a href="Kangaroo%20Island%20emu">Kangaroo Island emu</a> were therefore based on specimens from King Island or were otherwise <a href="valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">invalid</a>, leaving it nameless. Based on later finds of subfossil material in 1984, the Australian ornithologist <a href="Shane%20A.%20Parker">Shane A. Parker</a> confirmed the separate geographic origin and distinct <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the King and Kangaroo Island emus. Parker named the Kangaroo Island bird "Dromaius baudinianus", after <a href="Nicolas%20Baudin">Nicolas Baudin</a>, the leader of the French expedition. The name "Dromaius ater" was kept for the King Island emu.

There are few morphological differences that distinguish the extinct insular emus from the mainland emu besides their size, but all three taxa were most often considered distinct species. A 2011 genetic study of <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, which was extracted from five subfossil King Island emu bones, showed that its genetic variation fell within that of the extant mainland emus. It was therefore interpreted as <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> with the emus of the Australian mainland, and was reclassified as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "<a href="Dromaius%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bnovaehollandiae">Dromaius novaehollandiae</a>", "D. n. ater". Other animals present on King Island are also considered as subspecies of their mainland or Tasmanian counterparts rather than distinct species. The authors suggested that further studies using different methods might be able to find features that distinguish the taxa. In its 2013 edition, <a href="The%20Howard%20and%20Moore%20Complete%20Checklist%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World</a> emended the trinomial name of the King Island emu to "D. n. minor", based on Spencer's "D. minor", on the ground that Vieillot's "D. ater" was originally meant for the mainland emu. This rationale was accepted by the <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a>, which used "D. n. minor" thereafter.

In 2014-2015, the English palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> and colleagues conducted a search for emu fossils on King Island; no major palaeontological surveys had been done since the early 20th century, apart from discoveries made by a local natural historian (including of a unique eggshell) during the preceding thirty years. In 2014, Hume and colleagues found emu subfossils in <a href="Cape%20Wickham">Cape Wickham</a>, but upon returning to the site in 2015, the area had been turned into a Golf course, and the researchers were denied access to the site. They cautioned in 2018 that other fossiliferous sites on King Island were also under such threat, and highlighted the need to protect them. The researchers also identified an area near Surprise Bay where subfossils had been collected in 1906, but found it almost impossible to find more, since the area had been covered in grass in the meantime (the grass had previously been kept down by livestock).

During the <a href="Late%20Quaternary">Late Quaternary</a> period (0.7 million years ago), small emus lived on a number of offshore islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island ("<a href="D.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bn.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bbaudinianus">D. n. baudinianus</a>") and Tasmania ("<a href="D.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bn.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bdiemenensis">D. n. diemenensis</a>"), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> between <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and Victoria, approximately 100 km (62 mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the <a href="last%20glacial%20maximum">last glacial maximum</a> eventually isolated the island. As a result of <a href="phenotypic%20plasticity">phenotypic plasticity</a> the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of <a href="insular%20dwarfism">insular dwarfism</a>. Emu eggshells were also identified from <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a> (in the opposite, eastern end of the Bass Strait) in 2017, possibly representing a distinct taxon.

According to the authors of the 2011 genetic study by the Australian geneticist Tim H. Heupink and colleagues, the close relation between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a <a href="founder%20effect">founding</a> emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.

The King Island emu was the smallest emu taxon, and was about half the size of the mainland birds. It was about tall. According to François Péron's interview with a local <a href="seal%20hunting">sealer</a>, the largest specimens were up to 137 cm (4.5 ft) in length, and the heaviest weighed 20 to 23 kg (45 to 50 lb). It had a darker <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, with extensive black feathers on the neck and head, and blackish feathers on the body, where it was also mixed with brown. The bill and feet were blackish, and the naked skin on the side of the neck was blue. The 2011 genetic study did not find <a href="genes">genes</a> commonly associated with <a href="melanism">melanism</a> in birds, but proposed the dark colouration could be due to alternative genetic or non-genetic factors. Péron stated there was little difference between the sexes, but that the male was perhaps brighter in colouration and slightly larger. The juveniles were grey, while the chicks were striped like other emus. There were no seasonal variations in plumage. Since the female mainland emus are on average larger than the males, and can turn brighter during the mating season, contrary to the norm in other bird species, some of these observations may have been based on erroneous <a href="conventional%20wisdom">conventional wisdom</a>.

Subfossil remains of the King Island emu show that the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> was about 330 mm (13 in) long, and the <a href="femur">femur</a> was 180 mm (7 in) long. The <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> was 280 mm (11 in) long, 64 mm (2.5 in) wide at the front, and 86 mm (3 in) wide at the back. The <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> averaged 232 mm (9 in) in length. In males, the <a href="tibiotarsus">tibiotarsus</a> averaged 261 mm (10 in), whereas it averaged 301 mm (12 in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269 mm (10.5 in) and 305 mm (12 in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear <a href="foramen">foramen</a> of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer <a href="Trochlear%20process">trochlea</a> was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.

The King Island emu and the mainland emu show few morphological differences other than their significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of the mainland emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the <a href="culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a>, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the <a href="cranium">cranium</a>. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.

Péron's interview described some aspects of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He wrote that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the <a href="hunting%20dogs">hunting dogs</a> of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm.

The English Captain <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> did not encounter emus when he visited King Island in 1802, but his naturalist, Robert Brown, examined their dung and noted they had chiefly fed on the berries of "<a href="Leptecophylla%20juniperina">Leptecophylla juniperina</a>". An account by English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> about the "<a href="Van%20Diemen%27s">Van Diemen's</a> cassowary" may also refer to the King Island emu, based on the small size described. In addition to a physical description, he stated that they gathered in groups of 70 to 80 individuals in a given location while foraging, behaviour that was exploited by hunters. Hume and colleagues noted that most emu subfossils from King Island were found on the drier, leeward west coast of the island, and though probably due to <a href="preservation%20bias">preservation bias</a>, they suggested that the emus were restricted to coastal and more open inland areas, and not found in the dense interior forests. An 1802 report by the English surveyor <a href="Charles%20Grimes%20%28surveyor%29">Charles Grimes</a> also supported this, stating that "plenty on the coast–but not inland". The tall, dense <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forests of the island have since been destroyed.

Péron stated that the nest was usually situated near water and on the ground under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubated</a> the eggs, but the male apparently developed a <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a>, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and <a href="quolls">quolls</a>. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from <a href="crows">crows</a> with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.

The emus of King Island were first recorded by Europeans when a party from the ship "<a href="HMS%20Lady%20Nelson%20%281798%29">Lady Nelson</a>", led by the Scottish explorer <a href="John%20Murray%20%28Australian%20explorer%29">John Murray</a>, visited the island in January 1802. The bird was sporadically mentioned by travellers henceforward, but not in detail. Captain Nicolas Baudin visited King Island later in 1802, during an 1800–04 French expedition to map the coast of Australia. Two ships, "<a href="French%20corvette%20Naturaliste">Le Naturaliste</a>" and "<a href="French%20corvette%20G%C3%A9ographe">Le Géographe</a>", were part of the expedition, which also brought along naturalists who described the local wildlife. François Péron, a naturalist who was part of Baudin's expedition, visited King Island and was the last person to record descriptions of the King Island emu from the wild. At one point, Péron and some of his companions became stranded due to storms and took refuge with some <a href="seal%20hunters">seal hunters</a>. They were served emu meat, which Péron described in favourable terms as tasting halfway "between that of the turkey-cock and that of the young pig".

Péron did not report seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he described them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most of what is known about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point <a href="questionnaire">questionnaire</a> that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.

Several emu specimens belonging to the different subspecies were sent to France, both live and dead, as part of the expedition. Some of these exist in European museums today. "Le Naturaliste" brought one live specimen and one skin of the mainland emu to France in June 1803. "Le Géographe" collected emus from both King and Kangaroo Island, and at least two live King Island individuals, assumed to be a male and female by some sources, were taken to France in March 1804. This ship also brought skins of five juveniles collected from different islands. Two of these skins, of which the provenance is unknown, are presently kept in Paris and Turin; the rest are lost. In addition to rats, cockroaches, and other inconveniences aboard the ships, the emus were incommoded by the rough weather which caused the ships to shake violently; some died as a result, while others had to be force fed so they did not starve to death. In all, "Le Géographe" brought 73 live animals of various species back to France.

The two individuals brought to France were first kept in captivity in the menagerie of <a href="Empress%20Josephine">Empress Josephine</a>, and were moved to the <a href="Jardin%20des%20Plantes">Jardin des Plantes</a> after a year. The "female" died in April 1822, and its skin is now mounted in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris. The "male" died in May 1822, and is preserved as a skeleton in the same museum. A feather of the Paris skin was given to the <a href="Tasmanian%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery</a>, the only confirmed feather belonging to this subspecies currently in Australia. The Paris skin contains several bones, but not the pelvis, which is an indicator of sex, so the supposed female identity is unconfirmed. Péron noted that the small emus brought to France were distinct from those of the mainland, but not that they were distinct from each other, or which island each had come from, so their provenance was unknown for more than a century later.

There is also a skeleton in <a href="Museo%20di%20Storia%20Naturale%20di%20Firenze">Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze</a>, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a> until correctly identified by Italian zoologist <a href="Enrico%20Hillyer%20Giglioli">Enrico Hillyer Giglioli</a> in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It was thought to be a male, but is now known to be a composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the <a href="Liverpool%20Museum">Liverpool Museum</a>, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.

Péron's 1807, three-volume account of the expedition, "Voyage de découverte aux terres Australes", contains an illustration (plate 36) of "casoars" by <a href="Charles-Alexandre%20Lesueur">Charles-Alexandre Lesueur</a>, who was the resident artist during Baudin's voyage. The caption states the birds shown are from "Ile Decrès", the French name for Kangaroo Island, but there is confusion over what is actually depicted. The two adult birds are labelled as a male and female of the same species, surrounded by juveniles. The family-group shown is improbable, since breeding pairs of the mainland emu split up once the male begins incubating the eggs. Lesueur's preparatory sketches also indicate these may have been drawn after the captive birds in Jardin des Plantes, and not wild ones, which would have been harder to observe for extended periods.

The Australian museum curator, Stephanie Pfennigwerth, has instead proposed that the larger, light-ruffed "male" was actually drawn after a captive Kangaroo Island emu, that the smaller, dark "female" is a captive King Island emu, that the scenario is fictitious, and the sexes of the birds indeterminable. They may instead only have been assumed to be male and female of the same species due to their difference in size. A crooked claw on the "male" has also been interpreted as evidence that it had lived in captivity, and it may also indicate that the depicted specimen is identical to the Kangaroo Island emu skeleton in Paris, which has a deformed toe. The juvenile on the right may have been based on the Paris skin of an approximately five-month-old emu specimen (from either King or Kangaroo Island), which may in turn be the individual that died on board "le Geographe" during rough weather, and was presumably stuffed there by Lesueur himself. The chicks may instead simply have been based on those of mainland emus, as none are known to have been collected.

The exact cause for the extinction of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of <a href="elephant%20seals">elephant seals</a>. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed to the demise of the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.

Péron explained that the sealers consumed an enormous quantity of meat, and that their dogs killed several animals each day. He also observed such hunting dogs being released on Kangaroo Island, and mused that they might wipe out the entire population of <a href="kangaroos">kangaroos</a> there in some years, but he did not express the same sentiment about the emus of King Island. Based on the possibly restricted distribution of the emu to coastal areas, Hume and colleagues suggested this might explain their rapid disappearance, as these areas were easily accessible to sealers. <a href="Natural%20fires">Natural fires</a> may also have played a role. It is probable that the two captive birds in France, which died in 1822, outlived their wild fellows on King Island, and were therefore the last of their kind. Though Péron stated King Island "swarmed" with emus in 1802, they may have become <a href="extinct%20in%20the%20wild">extinct in the wild</a> as early as 1805. They were certainly extinct by 1836, when some English settlers arrived on the island. Elephant seals disappeared from the island around 1819 due to over-hunting.

In 1967, when the King Island emu was still thought to be only known from prehistoric remains, the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> questioned whether they could have been exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or <a href="lightning">lightning</a> may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.

Rodrigues rail

The Rodrigues rail ("Erythromachus leguati"), also known as Leguat's gelinote, Leguat's rail, or grey rail, is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of the <a href="Rallidae">rail</a> family that was endemic to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It has sometimes been assigned to the genus "Aphanapteryx", along with its close relative the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a> ("A. bonasia") of Mauritius, but is generally kept in its own genus, "Erythromachus". Their relationship with other rails is unclear. The Rodrigues rail was described as having grey plumage, a red beak, red legs, and a naked red patch around the eye. The beak varied between specimens from straight to curved, but the reason for this is unknown. It was <a href="flightless">flightless</a> and fed on tortoise eggs. It was described as being attracted to red objects, which humans exploited while hunting it.

The Rodrigues rail is believed to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. Apart from information gathered from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> bones, the bird is poorly known and was only documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts, but no such illustrations. The bird was first mentioned by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a>, a <a href="French%20Huguenot">French Huguenot</a> refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and was named "E. leguati" in his honour in 1874. The second account was by Julien Tafforet, also marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts.

In 1848, the English <a href="zoologist">zoologist</a> <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Strickland">Hugh Edwin Strickland</a> called attention to a bird mentioned in the French traveller <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a>'s 1708 <a href="memoir">memoir</a> about his stay on <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>. Leguat referred to the birds as "gelinottes" (translated as "wood-hens"), a name Strickland thought implied the <a href="grouse">grouse</a> (Tetraoninae) of Europe, though this was not consistent with the form of the beak described by Leguat. Strickland was unable to classify the bird further, but noted similarities with the <a href="dodo">dodo</a> ("Raphus cucullatus") and <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a> ("Apteryx"), based on unidentified birds from Mauritius illustrated by the travellers <a href="Pieter%20van%20den%20Broecke">Pieter van den Broecke</a> and <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert">Sir Thomas Herbert</a>, which he thought related. Strickland also noted similarities with a bird from Mauritius, which would later be identified as the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a> ("Aphanapteryx bonasia").

In 1874, the French zoologist <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> connected Leguat's account with three <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> bones (a <a href="sternum">sternum</a>, a <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a>, and a fragmentary skull) found in a cave on Rodrigues. He recognised their similarity to those of the red rail, while noting it supposedly had a straighter beak (as described by Leguat). Milne-Edwards coined the generic name "Erythromachus" from the Greek words for "red" and "battle" (also translated as "hostile to red"), in reference to its attraction to red objects, and the specific name is in honour of Leguat. The name "Erythromachus" was incorrectly explained as referring to the <a href="Erythraean%20sea">Erythraean sea</a> by the American <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Wallace%20Richmond">Charles Wallace Richmond</a> in 1908. The name "Miserythrus", from "red" and "hatred", was used by the English ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> in 1874 (originally only in a manuscript), and also refers to the rail's behaviour towards red, but as a newer name, it is a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a>.

In 1875, A. Newton also identified a reference to the bird in the 1726 account of the French traveller Julien Tafforet, which had then recently been rediscovered. In 1879, more fossils, including skulls, were described by the zoologists <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> and <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> (brother of Alfred), who confirmed that the bird was a <a href="rallidae">rail</a> (rallidae), but also noted that some specimens had beaks as curved as that of the red rail. The American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> suggested that Leguat's description referred to wind-blown <a href="purple%20swamphen">purple swamphen</a>s ("Porphyrio"), since the word grey is sometimes used synonymously with blue in old descriptions. This idea has not been accepted by other commentators. In 1999, the French <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> Cécile Mourer-Chauviré and his colleagues pointed out that a <a href="carpometacarpus">carpometacarpus</a> bone assigned to the Rodrigues rail and illustrated by Günther and A. Newton in 1879 does not belong to a rail, and therefore not this bird. More subfossils have since been discovered, including an associated but incomplete skeleton with a complete skull and jaws found in Caverne Poule Rouge in 2005.

Apart from being a close relative to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, "Aphanapteryx" and "Erythromachus", but have sometimes been united as species of "Aphanapteryx". Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist <a href="Jean%20Piveteau">Jean Piveteau</a> found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist <a href="Storrs%20L.%20Olson">Storrs L. Olson</a> stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a>, Olson suggested that they were related to the genera "<a href="Gallirallus">Gallirallus</a>", "<a href="Dryolimnas">Dryolimnas</a>", "<a href="Atlantisia">Atlantisia</a>", and "<a href="Rallus">Rallus</a>". Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic <a href="archipelagos">archipelagos</a>, which has frequently led to <a href="speciation">speciation</a> and evolution of <a href="flightlessness">flightlessness</a>. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a>, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.

In 1892, the Scottish naturalist <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> described <a href="Hawkins%27s%20rail">Hawkins's rail</a>, an extinct species of rail from the <a href="Chatham%20Islands">Chatham Islands</a>, as a new species of "Aphanapteryx"; "A. hawkinsi". He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist <a href="Charles%20William%20Andrews">Charles William Andrews</a> and the German ornithologist <a href="Hans%20Friedrich%20Gadow">Hans Friedrich Gadow</a>, and the bird was moved to its own genus, "Diaphorapteryx".

The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail with bright grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, and it had a red, naked area (or <a href="wattle%20%28anatomy%29">wattle</a>) around its eyes. Its exact size is unknown, but it was about the size of a chicken, and somewhat smaller than the related red rail. Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. The <a href="cranium">cranium</a> of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was long and wide. The cranium had a narrow, long <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a> region, at its least width. The beak varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, and others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. It is unknown whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. The <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> was slightly longer than the cranium. The beak was up to long, the lower jaw up to long, and at its greatest depth. The <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) was long, the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> ranged from , and the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> from . The <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was long, wide at the front, and wide at the back. The <a href="femur">femur</a> ranged from in length, the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> from , and the <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> was long.

The proportions of the legs, pelvis and <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar. The Rodrigues rail differed from the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, as well as a considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.

The Rodrigues rail was first recorded by Leguat in his 1708 memoir, "A New Voyage to the East Indies". Leguat was the leader of a group of nine <a href="French%20Huguenot">French Huguenot</a> refugees; the group were the first to colonise Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693, after they were <a href="wikt%3AMaroon%23Verb">marooned</a> there by their captain. Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild.

Leguat's full account of the bird reads as follows:
Another description of appearance and behaviour is found in a document called "Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue" attributed to Tafforet, who was marooned on Rodrigues in 1726:

Unlike the red rail and other extinct Mascarene birds, the Rodrigues rail was not illustrated by contemporaneous artists. Olson described reconstructions made for the British zoologist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a>'s 1907 book "<a href="Extinct%20Birds%20%28Rothschild%20book%29">Extinct Birds</a>" and the Japanese ornithologist <a href="Masauji%20Hachusika">Masauji Hachusika</a>'s 1953 book "The Dodo and Kindred Birds" as "rather fanciful". The English artist <a href="Frederick%20William%20Frohawk">Frederick William Frohawk</a> based his restoration in the former book on an outline illustration, which was in turn based on a sketch drawn by Herbert, which is now known to depict the red rail. The German zoologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> thought it depicted a species of dodo (which he called "Didus herbertii") from Rodrigues when he drew the outline in 1854, and that it was the species mentioned by Leguat.

According to Tafforet's account, the Rodrigues rail fed and fattened itself on the eggs of the now extinct "<a href="Cylindraspis">Cylindraspis</a>" tortoises; it is possible that the bird became fat seasonally. If the length and curvature of the beaks was sexually dimorphic, it may have reflected their diet. Like the red rail, it was said to be attracted to the colour red, but the significance of this is unknown. According to Milne-Edwards, the bird had legs "made for running".

Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem was heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little of those remain today. The Rodrigues rail lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a> ("Pezophaps solitaria"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20parrot">Rodrigues parrot</a> ("Necropsittacus rodricanus"), <a href="Newton%27s%20parakeet">Newton's parakeet</a> ("Psittacula exsul"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20starling">Rodrigues starling</a> ("Necropsar rodericanus"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20owl">Rodrigues owl</a> ("Mascarenotus murivorus"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20night%20heron">Rodrigues night heron</a> ("Nycticorax megacephalus"), and the <a href="Rodrigues%20pigeon">Rodrigues pigeon</a> ("Nesoenas rodericanus"). Extinct reptiles include the <a href="domed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">domed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a> ("Cylindraspis peltastes"), the <a href="saddle-backed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a> ("Cylindraspis vosmaeri"), and the <a href="Rodrigues%20day%20gecko">Rodrigues day gecko</a> ("Phelsuma edwardnewtoni").

The rapid disappearance of the Rodrigues rail may have been caused by introduced cats, but it is also possible that deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant "Cylindraspis" tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer <a href="Alexandre%20Guy%20Pingr%C3%A9">Alexandre Guy Pingré</a>, who visited Rodrigues to observe the <a href="1761%20transit%20of%20Venus">1761 transit of Venus</a>, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.

Red rail

The red rail ("Aphanapteryx bonasia") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of <a href="flightless">flightless</a> <a href="Rallidae">rail</a>. It was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, east of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. It had a close relative on <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> island, the likewise extinct <a href="Rodrigues%20rail">Rodrigues rail</a> ("Erythromachus leguati"), with which it is sometimes considered <a href="Conspecificity">congeneric</a>. Its relationship with other rails is unclear. Rails often evolve flightlessness when adapting to isolated islands, free of mammalian predators.

The red rail was a little larger than a chicken and had reddish, hairlike plumage, with dark legs and a long, curved beak. The wings were small, and its legs were slender for a bird of its size. It was similar to the Rodrigues rail, but was larger, and had proportionally shorter wings. It has been compared to a <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a> or a <a href="limpkin">limpkin</a> in appearance and behaviour. It is believed to have fed on <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>, and snail shells have been found with damage matching an attack by its beak. Human hunters took advantage of an attraction red rails had to red objects by using coloured cloth to lure the birds so that they could be beaten with sticks.

Until <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains were discovered in the 1860s, scientists only knew the red rail from 17th century descriptions and illustrations. These were thought to represent several different species, which resulted in a large number of invalid <a href="junior%20synonyms">junior synonyms</a>. It has been suggested that all late 17th-century accounts of the <a href="dodo">dodo</a> actually referred to the red rail, after the former had become extinct. The last mention of a red rail sighting is from 1693, and it is thought to have gone extinct around 1700, due to predation by humans and <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>.

The red rail was long known only from a few contemporary descriptions referring to red "hens" and names otherwise used for <a href="grouse">grouse</a> or <a href="partridges">partridges</a> in Europe, as well as the sketches of the travellers <a href="Pieter%20van%20den%20Broecke">Pieter van den Broecke</a> and <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert">Sir Thomas Herbert</a> from 1617 and 1634. These were thought to depict separate species of birds by some authors, but were regarded as one by the English naturalist <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Strickland">Hugh Edwin Strickland</a> in 1848. The German ornithologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> thought Broecke's sketch depicted a smaller <a href="dodo">dodo</a> species from Mauritius, and that the Herbert sketch showed a dodo from Rodrigues, and named them "Didus broecki" and "Didus herberti" in 1854. The Flemish artist <a href="Jacob%20Hoefnagel">Jacob Hoefnagel</a>'s 1610 painting, the 1601 sketch from the "Gelderland" ship's journal, and the English traveller <a href="Peter%20Mundy">Peter Mundy</a>'s 1638 description and sketch later surfaced, but there was still uncertainty about the identity of the birds depicted.

In the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found along with remains of other Mauritian animals in the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> swamp, and were identified as belonging to a rail by the French zoologist <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> in 1866. He also determined they belonged to the birds in the 17th century descriptions and illustrations. In 1869, Milne-Edwards combined the <a href="genus">genus</a> name of "Aphanapteryx imperialis", which had been coined the previous year by the Austrian naturalist <a href="Georg%20Ritter%20von%20Frauenfeld">Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld</a> for the Hoefnagel painting, with the older specific name "broecki". Due to <a href="nomenclatural%20priority">nomenclatural priority</a>, the genus name was later combined with the oldest species name "bonasia", which was coined by the Belgian scientist <a href="Edmond%20de%20S%C3%A9lys%20Longchamps">Edmond de Sélys Longchamps</a> in 1848. Sélys Longchamps had originally named the genus "Apterornis", wherein he also included the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20solitaire">Réunion solitaire</a> and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20swamphen">Réunion swamphen</a>, but the name was preoccupied by "<a href="Aptornis">Aptornis</a>", a bird described by the English biologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> in 1844. "Aphanapteryx" means "invisible-wing", but the meaning of "bonasia" is unclear. Some early accounts refer to red rails by the vernacular names for the <a href="hazel%20grouse">hazel grouse</a>, "Tetrastes bonasia", so the name evidently originates there. The name itself perhaps refers to "bonasus", meaning "bull" in Latin, or "bonum" and "assum", meaning "good roast". It has also been suggested to be a Latin form of the French word "bonasse", meaning simple-minded or good-natured.

More fossils were later found by Theodore Sauzier, who had been commissioned to explore the "historical souvenirs" of Mauritius in 1889. Around the end of the 19th century, a complete specimen was found by the barber Louis Etienne Thirioux, who also found important dodo remains.

Apart from being a close relative of the <a href="Rodrigues%20rail">Rodrigues rail</a>, the relationships of the red rail are uncertain. The two are commonly kept as separate genera, "Aphanapteryx" and "Erythromachus", but have also been united as species of "Aphanapteryx" at times. They were first generically synonymised by the British ornithologists <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> and <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> in 1879, due to skeletal similarities. In 1892, the Scottish naturalist <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> described <a href="Hawkins%27s%20rail">Hawkins's rail</a>, an extinct species of rail from the <a href="Chatham%20Islands">Chatham Islands</a>, as a new species of "Aphanapteryx"; "A. hawkinsi". He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands, as part of a <a href="lost%20continent">lost continent</a> he called "Antipodea". Forbes moved the Chatham Islands bird to its own genus, "Diaphorapteryx", in 1893, on the recommendation of Newton, but later reverted to his older name. The idea that the Chatham Islands bird was closely related to the red rail and the idea of a connection between the Mascarenes and the Chatham Islands were later criticised by the British palaeontologist <a href="Charles%20William%20Andrews">Charles William Andrews</a> due to no other species being shared between the islands, and the German ornithologist <a href="Hans%20F.%20Gadow">Hans F. Gadow</a> explained the similarity between the two rails as <a href="parallel%20evolution">parallel evolution</a>.

Based on geographic location and the morphology of the <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a>, the American ornithologist <a href="Storrs%20L.%20Olson">Storrs L. Olson</a> suggested in 1977 that they were related to the genera "<a href="Gallirallus">Gallirallus</a>", "<a href="Dryolimnas">Dryolimnas</a>", "<a href="Atlantisia">Atlantisia</a>", and "<a href="Rallus">Rallus</a>". Rails have reached many oceanic <a href="archipelagos">archipelagos</a>, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the English zoologists Anthony S. Cheke and <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a>, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.

From the subfossil bones, illustrations and descriptions, it is known that the red rail was a flightless bird, somewhat larger than a chicken. Subfossil specimens range in size, which may indicate <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, as is common among rails. Its exact length is unknown, but the pelvis was in length, the femur was , the tibia was , the <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> was , and the humerus was . Its plumage was reddish brown all over, and the <a href="feather">feather</a>s were fluffy and hairlike; the tail was not visible in the living bird and the short wings likewise also nearly disappeared in the <a href="plumage">plumage</a>. It had a long, slightly curved, brown <a href="beak">bill</a>, and some illustrations suggest it had a <a href="nape">nape</a> crest. It perhaps resembled a lightly built <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>, and it has also been likened to a <a href="limpkin">limpkin</a>, both in appearance and behaviour.

The <a href="sternum">sternum</a> and <a href="humerus">humerus</a> were small, indicating that it had lost the power of flight. Its legs were long and slender for such a large bird, but the pelvis was compact and stout. It differed from the Rodrigues rail, its closest relative, in having a proportionately shorter humerus, a narrower and longer skull, and having shorter and higher nostrils. They differed considerably in plumage, based on early descriptions. The red rail was also larger, with somewhat smaller wings, but their leg proportions were similar. The <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> and <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> was also similar.

Mundy visited Mauritius in 1638 and described the red rail as follows:
The yellowish colouration mentioned by Mundy instead of the red of other accounts was used by the Japanese ornithologist <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> in 1937 as an argument for this referring to a distinct species, "Kuina mundyi", but it has also been suggested it was due to the observed bird being a juvenile. Another English traveller, John Marshall, described the bird as follows in 1668:

Much information about the bird's appearance comes from a painting attributed to Jacob Hoefnagel, based on a bird in the <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a> of <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Rudolph II</a> around 1610. It is the only coloured depiction of the species, showing the plumage as reddish brown, but it is unknown whether it was based on a stuffed or living specimen. The bird had most likely been brought alive to Europe, as it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. Most <a href="tropical">tropical</a> specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet. It had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals painted for the same series. The painting was discovered in the emperor's collection and published in 1868 by Georg von Frauenfeld, along with a painting of a dodo from the same collection and artist. This specimen is thought to have been the only red rail that ever reached Europe.
The travel journal of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> ship "Gelderland" (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains good sketches of several now-extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle, including an unlabelled red rail. The bird appears to have been stunned or killed, and the sketch is the earliest record of the species, but was only rediscovered in the 1860s. The image was sketched with pencil and finished in ink, but details such as a deeper beak and the shoulder of the wing are only seen in the underlying sketch. In addition, there are three rather crude black-and-white sketches, but differences in them were enough for some authors to suggest that each image depicted a distinct species, leading to the creation of several scientific names which are now synonymous with "Aphanapteryx bonasia".

There are also depictions of what appears to be a red rail in three of the Dutch artist <a href="Roelant%20Savery">Roelant Savery</a>'s paintings. In his famous "Edwards' Dodo" painting from 1626, a rail-like bird is seen swallowing a frog behind the dodo, but this identification has been doubted, and it may instead show a <a href="bittern">bittern</a>. A bird resembling a red rail is also figured in the Italian artist <a href="Jacopo%20Bassano">Jacopo Bassano</a>'s painting "Arca di Noè" ("<a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>") from c. 1570. It has been pointed out that it is doubtful that a Mauritian bird could have reached Italy this early, but the attribution may be inaccurate, as Bassano had four artist sons who used the same name. A similar bird is also seen in the Flemish artist <a href="Jan%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Jan Brueghel the Elder</a>'s "Noah's Ark" painting.

Contemporary accounts are repetitive and do not shed much light on the bird's life history. The shape of the beak indicates it could have captured <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. There were many endemic land snails on Mauritius, including the extinct "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>", and subfossil shells have been found with damage matching attacks from the beak of the red rail. No contemporary accounts were known to mention the red rail's diet, until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015, where he mentioned that the bird "scratches in the earth with its sharp claws like a fowl to find food such as worms under the fallen leaves."

A 1631 Dutch letter (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) uses <a href="word-play">word-play</a> to refer to the animals described, with soldiers being an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> for red rails:
While it was swift and could escape when chased, it was easily lured by waving a red cloth, which they approached to attack; a similar behaviour was noted in its relative, the Rodrigues rail. The birds could then be picked up, and their cries when held would draw more individuals to the scene, as the birds, which had evolved in the absence of mammalian <a href="predator">predator</a>s, were curious and not afraid of humans.

The English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert described its behaviour towards red cloth in 1634:

Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man heavily damaged the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>, making it hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains today due to <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The surviving endemic <a href="fauna">fauna</a> is still seriously threatened. The red rail lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20blue%20pigeon">Mauritius blue pigeon</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20owl">Mauritius owl</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20coot">Mascarene coot</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20shelduck">Mauritian shelduck</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20duck">Mauritian duck</a>, and the <a href="Mauritius%20night%20heron">Mauritius night heron</a>. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the <a href="saddle-backed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="domed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">domed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20giant%20skink">Mauritian giant skink</a>, and the <a href="Round%20Island%20burrowing%20boa">Round Island burrowing boa</a>. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "Tropidophora carinata" lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as "<a href="Casearia%20tinifolia">Casearia tinifolia</a>" and the <a href="palm%20orchid">palm orchid</a>, have also become extinct.

Though Mauritius had previously been visited by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> vessels in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after <a href="Maurice%20of%20Nassau">Maurice of Nassau</a>, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. The dodo was sometimes considered rather unpalatable, but the red rail was a very popular <a href="gamebird">gamebird</a> for the Dutch and French settlers. The reports dwell upon the varying ease with which the bird could be caught according to the hunting method and the fact that when roasted it was considered similar to <a href="pork">pork</a>. 

Johann Christian Hoffmann, who was on Mauritius in the early 1670s, described a red rail hunt as follows:
Hoffman's account refers to the red rail by the German version of the Dutch name originally applied to the dodo, "dod-aers", and John Marshall used "red hen" interchangeably with "dodo" in 1668. Cheke has suggested that the name "dodo" was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct, so that all post 1662 references to "dodos" refer to the rail instead. A 1681 account of a "dodo", previously thought to have been the last, mentioned that the meat was "hard", similar to the description of red hen meat. <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a> has also cast the 1662 "dodo" sighting in doubt, as the reaction to distress cries of the birds mentioned matches what was described for the red rail. Milne-Edwards suggested that early travellers may have confused young dodos with red rails.

230 years before <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s <a href="theory%20of%20evolution">theory of evolution</a>, the appearance of the red rail and the dodo led Mundy to speculate:
In addition to hunting pressure by humans, the fact that the red rail nested on the ground made it vulnerable to pigs and other <a href="introduced%20animals">introduced animals</a>, which ate their eggs and young, probably contributing to its extinction. Feral cats, which are effective predators of ground-inhabiting birds, increased in numbers around the 1680s. When the French traveller <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a>, who had become familiar with the Rodrigues rail in the preceding years, arrived on <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> in 1693, he remarked that the red rail had already become rare. He was the last source to mention the bird, so it is assumed that it became extinct around 1700.

SummerSlam (2003)

SummerSlam (2003) was a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">event</a> produced by <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> (WWE). It took place August 24, 2003, at the <a href="America%20West%20Arena">America West Arena</a> in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. It was the 16th annual <a href="SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> event and featured <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20personnel">wrestlers</a> from the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> and <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown!</a> <a href="WWE%20Brand%20Extension">brands</a>.

Nine <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> matches were set on the event's <a href="supercard">supercard</a>, a scheduling of multiple high-level matches. The first <a href="card%20%28sports%29%23main%20event">main event</a> was an <a href="Elimination%20Chamber">Elimination Chamber</a> match, in which <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> defeated <a href="Chris%20Jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a href="Bill%20Goldberg">Goldberg</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a>, <a href="Randy%20Orton">Randy Orton</a>, and <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> to retain his championship. In the other main event, defending <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Champion</a> <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> defeated <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> in a <a href="professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">standard wrestling match</a>. The <a href="undercard">undercard</a> included <a href="Glenn%20Jacobs">Kane</a> defeating <a href="Rob%20Van%20Dam">Rob Van Dam</a> in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23No%20Holds%20Barred%20match">No Holds Barred match</a>, and <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> defending his <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">United States Championship</a> against <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a>, <a href="Rhino%20%28wrestler%29">Rhyno</a> and <a href="Yoshihiro%20Tajiri">Tajiri</a>.

The event marked the second time the Elimination Chamber format was used by WWE; the first was at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282002%29">Survivor Series 2002</a>. SummerSlam (2003) grossed over $715,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113 and received about 415,000 pay-per-view buys, more than the <a href="SummerSlam%20%282004%29">following year's event</a>. This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $6.2 million from the previous year.

The <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types">professional wrestling matches</a> at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">characters</a> in <a href="Kayfabe">scripted events</a> pre-determined by the hosting <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows "Raw" and "SmackDown!" with the Raw and SmackDown! brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its independent contractors to different programs.
In the first <a href="main%20event">main event</a> of SummerSlam wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an <a href="Elimination%20Chamber">Elimination Chamber</a> match, in which the ring is surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match was contested for the <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a>, in which <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> defended the title against <a href="Chris%20Jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a href="Bill%20Goldberg">Goldberg</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a>, <a href="Randy%20Orton">Randy Orton</a>, and <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>. The buildup to the match began on July 22, 2003, when during the SummerSlam <a href="News%20conference">press conference</a>, the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers">authority figure</a> <a href="Eric%20Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a>, announced that Triple H would defend the championship against Goldberg in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">standard wrestling match</a> at the event. On August 4, 2003 during a television episode of "Raw", Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23No%20Disqualification%20match">No disqualification</a> regulations. Later during the episode, another authority figure, <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">Steve Austin</a>, altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. Six days before SummerSlam, during an episode of "Raw" on August 18, 2003, the <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">rivalry</a> among the six competitors intensified during a <a href="Pop%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">promotional interview segment</a>, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but as he was about to hit Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a <a href="Folding%20chair">chair</a>.
The second main event resulted from events on <a href="WWE%20SmackDown">SmackDown!</a>, WWE's other main television program. In the match, <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> defended his <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> against <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>. The build-up to the match began on July 31, 2003 on an episode of "SmackDown!". During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch of their bout at <a href="Vengeance%20%282003%29">Vengeance</a>, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. The WWE Chairman, <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a <a href="Cage%20match">steel cage match</a> against McMahon himself, and would take place on SmackDown! the following week, with Angle officiating as a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Special%20referee">special guest referee</a>. The Steel Cage match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after McMahon and Lesnar attacked Angle. On August 14, 2003 during an episode of "SmackDown!", McMahon announced that Angle would defend the championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam.

In a <a href="Undercard">preliminary match</a> involving wrestlers from the Raw brand, <a href="Rob%20Van%20Dam">Rob Van Dam</a> wrestled <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a> under No disqualification regulations. The events leading up to this match began on the June 23, 2003 edition of "Raw", when Kane took his mask off and exposed his face in front of RVD and the crowd after he lost to <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> during a <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a> match. Then, on July 7, 2003, when Kane attacked Van Dam backstage during an episode of "Raw". The following week on an episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff granted Van Dam a standard match against Kane, which took place the following week on "Raw" and ended in neither wrestler winning the match. On August 4, 2003, <a href="Shane%20McMahon">Shane McMahon</a>, the son of Mr. McMahon, scheduled a No Disqualification match between the two wrestlers for SummerSlam.

In another prelimary match, wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand competed in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches">match between four wrestlers</a> for the <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">WWE United States Championship</a>: <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> defended the title against <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a>, <a href="Rhino%20%28wrestler%29">Rhyno</a>, and <a href="Yoshihiro%20Tajiri">Tajiri</a>. The buildup to the match began with two different rivalries, one between Guerrero and Tajiri, and the other between Benoit and Rhyno. On August 7, 2003 during an episode of "SmackDown!", Guerrero and Benoit wrestled in a standard match. However, during the match, Rhyno and Tajiri interfered, resulting in neither wrestler winning the match. <a href="Sgt.%20Slaughter">Sgt. Slaughter</a>, a WWE official, scheduled a tag team match between the team of Guerrero and Benoit and the team of Rhyno and Tajiri, which Guerrero and Benoit won. The following week on an episode of "SmackDown!", a SummerSlam advertisement announced that Guerrero would defend the WWE United States Championship against Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri.

Before the event aired <a href="live%20television">live</a> on <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a>, <a href="Matt%20Hardy">Matt Hardy</a> faced <a href="Zach%20Gowen">Zach Gowen</a> on "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Sunday Night Heat</a>", one of WWE's secondary TV programs. Gowen, however, was unable to compete due to <a href="legit%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">legit</a> injuries he sustained on the August 21, 2003 episode of "SmackDown!". In result, Hardy was declared the winner via forfeit. 

In the next match, <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> faced <a href="Shannon%20Moore">Shannon Moore</a> for the <a href="WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship%20%281991-2007%29">WWE Cruiserweight Championship</a>, in which Mysterio <a href="pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinned</a> Moore to retain the title after he performed <a href="Tiger%20feint%20kick">619</a>.

After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view event began with a <a href="tag%20team%23Tag%20team%20match%20rules">tag team match</a> for the <a href="World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Tag Team Championship</a>. The champions, <a href="La%20R%C3%A9sistance%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">La Résistance</a> (<a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goguen">René Duprée</a> and <a href="Sylvain%20Grenier">Sylvain Grenier</a>), defended their titles against <a href="The%20Dudley%20Boyz">The Dudley Boyz</a> (<a href="Mark%20LoMonaco">Bubba Ray Dudley</a> and <a href="Devon%20Hughes">D-Von Dudley</a>). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Death%20Drop">3D</a> on Duprée. As D-Von <a href="Lateral%20press">covered</a> Duprée, <a href="Rob%20Conway">Rob Conway</a>, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.
The following match pitted <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> against <a href="Matt%20Bloom">A-Train</a> in a standard match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a <a href="Tombstone%20piledriver">Tombstone piledriver</a>. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted to take advantage of the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a <a href="folding%20chair">steel chair</a>. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then <a href="chokeslam">chokeslammed</a> A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall. After the match, <a href="Sable%20%28wrestler%29">Sable</a> tried to seduce Undertaker, but was grabbed by the throat and then was attacked by a returning <a href="Stephanie%20McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>.

The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a standard match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as <a href="Jonathan%20Coachman">Jonathan Coachman</a> appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under <a href="Falls%20count%20anywhere%20match">no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations</a>; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers">double-team</a> attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a <a href="Stunner%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">Stone Cold Stunners</a> on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a <a href="Diving%20elbow%20drop">Leap of Faith</a> onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.
The next match involved four wrestlers from the Smackdown! brand in a match for the WWE United States Championship; Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The match began with Guerrero wrestling with Tajiri, while Benoit wrestled with Rhyno. During the encounter Guerrero applied a <a href="Texas%20cloverleaf">Lasso From El Passo</a> on Tajiri, while Benoit employed a <a href="Crippler%20Crossface">Crippler Crossface</a> on Rhyno. Afterwards, Tajiri applied a <a href="Boston%20crab%23Rope%20hung%20Boston%20crab">Tarantula</a> on Benoit. The hold distracted the referee, which allowed Guerrero to hit Rhyno with the United States Championship belt. Tajiri then attempted to hit Benoit with a <a href="roundhouse%20kick">Buzzsaw Kick</a>, but Benoit countered the maneuver by lifting and sitting Tajiri onto his shoulders. Tajiri, however, countered by tossing both himself and Benoit over the top rope onto the arena floor. Capitalizing on the situation, Guerrero then performed a <a href="Frog%20splash">Frog splash</a> on Rhyno, after which he scored the pinfall, thus retaining the WWE United States Championship.

The fifth match was the main event from the SmackDown brand, a standard match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At the beginning of the match, Lesnar tried to walk away from the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including <a href="DDT%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">DDT</a> and <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throw%23Olympic%20slam">Angle Slam</a>. He then applied an <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Ankle%20lock">ankle lock</a> on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Guillotine%20choke">guillotine choke</a> on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon interfered,came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his <a href="Facebuster%23F-5">F-5</a>. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Submission">tap out</a>. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.

In a preliminary match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match. Both wrestlers used a ladder to their advantage early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a <a href="Diving%20clothesline">flying clothesline</a>. However, Van Dam moved out of the way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a <a href="Rolling%20Thunder%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">rolling thunder</a> on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Spinning%20heel%20kick">Van Daminator</a> with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall.
The main event from the Raw brand was the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The match began with Jericho and Michaels in the ring, while Goldberg, Nash, Orton, and Triple H were locked in the chambers. Michaels and Jericho wrestled, with neither of them gaining the advantage over the other. Orton and Nash were the third and fourth entrants into the match, respectively. Nash was the first wrestler eliminated from the match after Michaels executed a <a href="superkick">superkick</a> and Chris Jericho covered him for a pinfall. Triple H and Goldberg were the fifth and sixth entrants. Michaels performed another superkick on Triple H as soon as he exited his chamber, and as a result, Triple H was knocked back into his chamber. As soon as Goldberg entered the match, he performed a <a href="Spear%20%28wrestling%29">spear</a> for a pinfall to eliminate Orton. Next, Goldberg performed a <a href="Suplex%23Suplex%20slam">Jackhammer</a> on Michaels and Jericho, eliminating both via pinfall. This left Goldberg alone with and Triple H, who at the time had remained inside the chamber. Goldberg performed a spear on him through the glass of the chamber, in the process pushing him out of the chamber. <a href="Ric%20Flair">Ric Flair</a>, who was managing both Triple H and Orton, then handed Triple H a <a href="sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>. Goldberg attempted another spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg with the sledgehammer and covered him for the pinfall, thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Triple H, Orton and Flair viciously attacked Goldberg, ending with Triple H busting Goldberg open by repeatedly hitting him in the head with his sledgehammer.

During an episode of "Raw" after SummerSlam, Goldberg challenged Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match took place at the <a href="Unforgiven%20%282003%29">Unforgiven</a> pay-per-view on September 21, 2003 with a stipulation that, should he lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his attention on The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during an episode of "SmackDown!" on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with a folding chair, leading to an <a href="Iron%20Man%20match">Iron Man match</a> between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title.

The rivalry between Kane and Rob Van Dam stopped, as Kane engaged in a feud against Shane McMahon. In a scenario on the August 25, 2003 episode of "Raw", Kane attempted to throw McMahon into a dumpster that was set on fire, but McMahon avoided it and threw Kane into the dumpster. On September 8, 2003 during an episode of "Raw", Eric Bischoff scheduled a <a href="Last%20Man%20Standing%20match">Last Man Standing match</a> between Kane and McMahon for Unforgiven. In that match, Kane defeated McMahon after McMahon was unable to respond to a ten count. After SummerSlam, Eddie Guerrero began a rivalry with <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> over the WWE United States Championship. Guerrero retained the championship in two title defenses that took place on "SmackDown!". Guerrero then engaged in a feud with <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>. At <a href="No%20Mercy%20%282003%29">No Mercy</a>, Big Show defeated Guerrero via pinfall to win the WWE United States Championship.

The America West Arena has a maximum capacity of 19,000, but that was reduced for SummerSlam 2003. The event grossed over US$715,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113, the maximum allowed. This was later confirmed by <a href="Linda%20McMahon">Linda McMahon</a>, WWE <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a>, in a press release on August 26, 2003. The event resulted in 415,000 pay-per-view buys (a 0.88 pay-per-view buyrate). The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7 million.

<a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Canadian Online Explorer</a>'s professional wrestling section rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars. The rating was higher than the <a href="SummerSlam%20%282004%29">SummerSlam event in 2004</a>, which was rated a 5 out of 10 stars. The Elimination Chamber main event match from the Raw brand was rated an 8.5 out of 10 stars, with an additional rating of 1 out of 10 stars for the process in which the match ended. The SmackDown! brand's main event, a standard match for the WWE Championship, was rated a 9 out of 10 stars, a better reception than the Raw brand's main event. <a href="Wade%20Keller">Wade Keller</a> reviewed the event for the "Pro Wrestling Torch". He rated the Angle-Lesnar match 4-and-a-half out of 5 stars, declaring it an "excellent match". The Elimination Chamber match received a rating of 3 stars. The event was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> on September 23, 2003 by <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a>.

Mascarene parrot

The Mascarene parrot or mascarin ("Mascarinus mascarin") is an <a href="Extinction">extinct</a> species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> that was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene island</a> of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> in the western <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> relationships of this species have been subject to debate; it has historically been grouped with either the <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a> parrots or the <a href="vasa%20parrot">vasa parrot</a>s, with the latest genetic study favouring the former group.

The Mascarene parrot was in length with a large red <a href="Beak">bill</a> and long, rounded <a href="Flight%20feather">tail feathers</a>. Its legs were red, and it had naked red skin around the eyes and nostrils. It had a black facial mask and partially white tail feathers, but the colouration of the body, wings and head in the living bird is unclear. Descriptions from life indicate the body and head were ash grey, and the white part of the tail had two dark central feathers. In contrast stuffed specimens and old descriptions based on them indicate that the body was brown and the head bluish. This may be due to the specimens having changed colour as a result of ageing and exposure to light. Very little is known about the bird in life.

The Mascarene parrot was first mentioned in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, where they lived in <a href="Captivity%20%28animal%29">captivity</a>. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account, from 1834, is considered dubious, so it is probable that the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct even earlier.

The Mascarene parrot was first mentioned by the French traveller <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a> in his 1674 <a href="travel%20literature">travelogue</a> and only described a few times from life afterwards. At least three live specimens were brought to <a href="France">France</a> in the late 18th century and kept in captivity, two of which were described while alive. Today, two stuffed specimens exist; the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>, specimen MNHN 211, which is in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20National%20d%27Histoire%20Naturelle">Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle</a> in Paris, while the other, specimen NMW 50.688, is in the <a href="Naturhistorisches%20Museum">Naturhistorisches Museum</a> in Vienna. The latter specimen was bought from the <a href="Leverian%20Museum">Leverian Museum</a> during a sale in <a href="London">London</a> in 1806. A third stuffed specimen existed around the turn of the 18th century. The Mascarene parrot was <a href="Species%20description">scientifically described</a> as "<a href="Psittacus">Psittacus</a> mascarinus" (abbreviated as ""mascarin"") by the Swedish <a href="Zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1771. This name was first used by the French zoologist <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> in 1760 but was not intended as a scientific name. The name is a reference to the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene Islands</a>, which were themselves named after their <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> discoverer, <a href="Pedro%20Mascarenhas">Pedro Mascarenhas</a>.

Early writers claimed the Mascarene parrot was found on <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, an idea that led the French <a href="Natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">René Primevère Lesson</a> to coin the <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> "Mascarinus madagascariensis" in 1831. His new <a href="genus">genus</a> name prevailed and, when the Italian zoologist <a href="Tommaso%20Salvadori">Tommaso Salvadori</a> combined it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a <a href="tautonym">tautonym</a> (a scientific name in which the two parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the "<a href="Tanygnathus">Tanygnathus</a>" and "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>" genera in "Mascarinus", but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German <a href="Herpetology">herpetologist</a> <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Wagler">Johann Georg Wagler</a> erected the genus "<a href="Coracopsis">Coracopsis</a>" for the Mascarene parrot (which became "Coracopsis mascarina" under this system) and the <a href="lesser%20vasa%20parrot">lesser vasa parrot</a> ("Coracopsis nigra"). The English zoologist <a href="William%20Alexander%20Forbes">William Alexander Forbes</a>, believing that "mascarinus" was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name "Mascarinus duboisi" in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> name was emended from "M. mascarinus" to "M. mascarin" by the <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a> in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.

An unidentified dark parrot seen alive by the Swedish naturalist <a href="Fredrik%20Hasselqvist">Fredrik Hasselqvist</a> in Africa was given the name "Psittacus obscurus" by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed it was from the Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as "Mascarinus obscurus" and "Coracopsis obscura". The unidentified parrot may have been a <a href="grey%20parrot">grey parrot</a> ("Psittacus erithacus") instead.

Another unidentified parrot specimen, this one brown and housed in <a href="Cabinet%20du%20Roi">Cabinet du Roi</a>, was described by the French naturalist <a href="Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a> in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out similarities and differences between the two. The English <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a> ("Psittacula bensoni"). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> assigned some <a href="eclectus%20parrot">eclectus parrot</a> ("Eclectus roratus") <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> from the <a href="Moluccas">Moluccas</a> to "Mascarinus" in his book "A List of the Genera of Birds" from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> parrot remains were later excavated from <a href="grotto">grotto</a>s on Réunion and reported in 1996. <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s of the two existing stuffed Mascarene parrots made it possible to compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were more similar to those of the Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.

The affinities of the Mascarene parrot are unclear, and two hypotheses have competed since the mid-19th century. Some authors grouped it with the <a href="Coracopsinae">Coracopsinae</a> (of African origin) due to its dark <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, and others with the <a href="Psittaculinae">Psittaculinae</a> parrots (of Asian origin) based on the large red beak, a feature which is diagnostic for that group. Its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a psittaculine, though other members have black facial patterns. Although little is known about most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes, subfossil remains show that they shared common features, such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced <a href="wikt%3Apectoral">pectoral</a> bones, and robust leg bones. Hume supported their common origin in the <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of the Psittaculini <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features and the fact that "Psittacula" parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>.

<a href="Sea%20level">Sea level</a>s were lower during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, so it was possible for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a>s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the <a href="volcano">volcano</a> <a href="Piton%20des%20Neiges">Piton des Neiges</a> between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would have been one of the few survivors of this <a href="extinction%20event">extinction event</a>.

A 2011 genetic study by Samit Kundu and colleagues (which sampled the Paris specimen) found that the Mascarene parrot was grouped among the subspecies of the lesser vasa parrot from Madagascar and nearby islands and therefore not related to the "Psittacula" parrots. It also found that the Mascarene parrot line diverged 4.6 to 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of Réunion, indicating this must have happened elsewhere. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> accompanying the 2011 study is shown below:
In 2012, Leo Joseph and colleagues acknowledged the finding but pointed out that the sample might have been damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if "Mascarinus" was confirmed to be embedded within the genus "Coracopsis", the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that are believed to be psittaculines. He also pointed out that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching Réunion.

In 2017, Lars Podsiadlowski and colleagues sampled the Vienna specimen for a new genetic study and found that the Mascarene parrot was indeed part of the "Psittacula" group as suggested by Hume, clustering with the extinct <a href="Seychelles%20parakeet">Seychelles parakeet</a> ("P. wardi") and Asian subspecies of the <a href="Alexandrine%20parakeet">Alexandrine parakeet</a> ("P. eupatria"). The Mascarene parrot was therefore interpreted as having descended from an ancestral lineage of Alexandrine parakeets that had dispersed from Asia towards the Mascarene islands across the Indian Ocean. The researchers suggested that the 2011 genetic study had probably used a composite of sequences from two other parrot species sampled for the study (including a lesser vasa parrot), a result of contamination during laboratory procedures. The 2017 study also found that the parrots of the genus "Tanygnathus" were grouped among "Psittacula" parrots, and proposed that"Tanygnathus" and "Mascarinus" should therefore be merged into the genus "Psittacula". The cladogram accompanying the 2017 study is shown below:

The Mascarene parrot was in length. The wing was , the tail , the <a href="culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> , and the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> . It had a large red bill and moderately long, rounded tail feathers. It had a black <a href="velvet">velvet</a>-like facial mask on the front part of the head. There are several discrepancies in how the colour of the body, wings, tail feathers and the head have historically been described and depicted. In 1674, Dubois described live specimens as being "petit-gris" which is the colour of the dark phase of the <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>. According to Hume, this colour is a dark blackish grey or brown.

In 1760, Brisson published the following description based on a captive bird (which may have been the specimen now preserved in Paris):
Instead of grey, several later authors described the body as brown and the head as bluish <a href="Lilac%20%28color%29">lilac</a>, based on stuffed specimens, and this has become the "orthodox image" of the bird. Live birds were never described with these colours. Hume proposed that this colouration is an artifact of the <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a> specimens having aged and being exposed to light, which can turn grey and black to brown. Such a transformation has also turned an aberrant <a href="dickcissel">dickcissel</a> ("Spiza americana") specimen (sometimes considered a distinct species, "Townsend's dickcissel"), from grey to brown. The two extant Mascarene parrot specimens also differ from each other in colouration. The Paris specimen has a greyish-blue head, and a brown body, paler on the underparts. Its tail and wing feathers were severely damaged by <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a> in an attempt at <a href="fumigation">fumigation</a> in the 1790s. The Vienna specimen is a pale brown on the head and body overall, with an irregular distribution of white feathers on the tail, back, and wings. In 2017 the Australian ornithologist <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Forshaw">Joseph M. Forshaw</a> found it hard to accept that all the illustrations that showed the colour as brown were wrong; he found it more likely that the brown would have merely faded in intensity rather than from grey to brown. He stated that by the time the earliest known illustrations of the bird were made, it is unlikely they would already have faded to brown because of exposure to light. He also doubted that poor diet of caged birds would have consistently turned them brown, and instead accepted the "orthodox image" of the bird as brown.

Confusion over the colouration of the Mascarene parrot has also been furthered by a plate by French engraver <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Nicolas%20Martinet">François-Nicolas Martinet</a> in Buffon's 1779 "Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux", the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, and the strength of these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been <a href="hand-coloured">hand-coloured</a> by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from <a href="chestnut%20brown">chestnut brown</a> to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.

In 1879, Forbes stated the <a href="cere">cere</a> was covered by feathers which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had its skull and <a href="mandible">mandible</a> removed for study by the French zoologist <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> prior to 1866. This may have led to the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.

Very little is known about the Mascarene parrot in life. Since several specimens were kept alive in captivity, it was probably not a <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">specialised feeder</a>. That the Vienna specimen was partially white may have been the result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity; the clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged. Little was known about parrot-diet in the 1700s, and the Vienna specimen may not have received enough of the <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a> through its food, which it would have needed for <a href="melanin%20synthesis">melanin synthesis</a>. In other parrots, this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in the affected feathers, due to the presence of the pigment psittacin, but "Coracopsis" parrots and the Mascarene parrot are the only parrots that lack this pigment. The specimen has also been described as "partially <a href="Albinism">albinistic</a>" at times, though true albinism (lack of the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="tyrosinase">tyrosinase</a>) can by definition never only be partial.

In 1705, the French cartographer <a href="Jean%20Feuilley">Jean Feuilley</a> gave a description of the parrots of Réunion and their ecology which indicates that they fattened themselves seasonally:

The Mascarene parrot may have once inhabited <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> as well based on a 17th-century account by the English traveller <a href="Peter%20Mundy">Peter Mundy</a> which mentioned "russet parrots". This is a possibility, since Réunion and Mauritius do share some types of animals, but no fossil evidence has yet been discovered.

Many other endemic species of Réunion became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20ibis">Réunion ibis</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">Réunion parakeet</a>, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20swamphen">Réunion swamphen</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20owl">Réunion owl</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20night%20heron">Réunion night heron</a>, and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20pink%20pigeon">Réunion pink pigeon</a>. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20giant%20tortoise">Réunion giant tortoise</a> and an undescribed "<a href="Leiolopisma">Leiolopisma</a>" skink. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Réunion and Mauritius but vanished from both islands.

Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the <a href="echo%20parakeet">echo parakeet</a> ("Psittacula echo") of Mauritius has survived. The others probably all became extinct due to a combination of excessive hunting and <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Hahn">Carl Wilhelm Hahn</a> published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria</a>. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.

The veracity of Hahn's claim was questioned as early as 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory of species. Hahn did not mention the date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. The fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.

If Hahn's account is disregarded, the Mascarene parrot probably became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion is from the 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went <a href="extinct%20in%20the%20wild">extinct in the wild</a> while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens are known to have lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French naturalist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Levaillant">François Levaillant</a> stated that the bird was rare and that he had seen three of them in France.

One of the last definite accounts of live specimens is the following 1784 description by Mauduyt based on captive birds:

Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois mentioned that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which may have led to Réunion visitors mostly ignoring it. It was the last of the indigenous parrots of Réunion to become extinct. The only endemic bird species on Réunion that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a> in the mid-19th century.

Rodrigues parrot

The Rodrigues parrot ("Necropsittacus rodricanus") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> that was <a href="endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, east of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It is unclear to which other species it is most closely related, but it is classified as a member of the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a>, along with other Mascarene parrots. The Rodrigues parrot bore similarities to the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a> of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, and may have been related. Two additional species have been assigned to its <a href="genus">genus</a> ("N. francicus" and "N. borbonicus"), based on descriptions of parrots from the other Mascarene islands, but their identities and validity have been debated.

The Rodrigues parrot was green, and had a proportionally large head and beak along with a long tail. Its exact size is unknown, but it may have been around long. It was the largest parrot on Rodrigues, and it had the largest head of any Mascarene parrot. It may have looked similar to the <a href="great-billed%20parrot">great-billed parrot</a>. By the time it was discovered, it frequented and nested on islets off southern Rodrigues, where introduced rats were absent, and fed on the seeds of the "<a href="Fernelia%20buxifolia">Fernelia buxifolia</a>" shrub. The species is known from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> bones and from mentions in contemporary accounts. It was last mentioned in 1761, and probably became extinct soon after, perhaps due to a combination of predation by rats, <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, and hunting by humans.

Birds thought to be the Rodrigues parrot were first mentioned by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a> in his 1708 memoir, "A New Voyage to the East Indies". Leguat was the leader of a group of nine <a href="French%20Huguenot">French Huguenot</a> refugees who colonised <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> between 1691 and 1693 after they were <a href="wikt%3Amaroon%23Verb">marooned</a> there. Subsequent accounts were by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his "Relation de l'Île Rodrigue", and then by the French mathematician <a href="Alexandre%20Pingr%C3%A9">Alexandre Pingré</a>, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the <a href="1761%20transit%20of%20Venus">1761 transit of Venus</a>.

The Rodrigues parrot was <a href="scientifically%20described">scientifically described</a> and named as "<a href="Psittacus">Psittacus</a> rodricanus" in 1867 by the French ornithologist <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a>, based on a <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> partial beak. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to Rodrigues, which is itself named after the discoverer of the island, the Portuguese navigator <a href="Diogo%20Rodrigues">Diogo Rodrigues</a>. Milne-Edwards corrected the spelling of the specific name to "rodericanus" in 1873 (in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds), a spelling which was used in the literature henceforward, but it was changed back to "rodricanus" by the <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a> in 2014. Milne-Edwards moved the species to its own <a href="genus">genus</a> "Necropsittacus" in 1874; the name is derived from the Greek words "necros", which means dead, and "psittakos", parrot, in reference to the bird being extinct.
The current whereabouts of the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> beak are unknown. It may be specimen UMZC 575, a <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> that was sent from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne-Edwards' paper, but this cannot be confirmed. In 1893 the ornithologists <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> (brother of Alfred) and <a href="Hans%20Gadow">Hans Gadow</a> described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, and subfossils have been discovered in caves on the <a href="Plaine%20Corail">Plaine Corail</a> and in <a href="Caverne%20Tortue">Caverne Tortue</a>.

In the footnotes to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil species with parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified a description of the Rodrigues parrot therein. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer <a href="Samuel%20Pasfield%20Oliver">Samuel Pasfield Oliver</a> doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been <a href="Newton%27s%20parakeet">Newton's parakeet</a> ("Psittacula exsul"). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two <a href="colour%20morphs">colour morphs</a> of the latter.

Many <a href="endemic">endemic</a> Mascarene birds, including the <a href="dodo">dodo</a> ("Raphus cucullatus"), are derived from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a> ("Lophopsittacus mauritianus") due to their large jaws and other <a href="osteological">osteological</a> features, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.

Hume has suggested that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of the <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a> <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a>, basing this theory on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features and the fact that "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>" parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a>s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.

The British zoologist <a href="Walther%20Rothschild">Walther Rothschild</a> assigned two <a href="Hypothetical%20species">hypothetical</a> parrot species from the other Mascarene Islands to the genus "Necropsittacus"; "N. francicus" in 1905 and "N. borbonicus" (named for Bourbon, the original name of Réunion) in 1907. "N. borbonicus" was based on a single account by the French traveller <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a>, who mentioned "green parrots of the same size [presumably as the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">Réunion parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques eques")] with head, upper parts of the wings, and tail the colour of fire" on Réunion. Rothschild considered it to belong to "Necropsittacus" since Dubois compared it with "Psittacula" species, which are related. Rothschild gave the original description of "N. francicus" as "head and tail fiery red, rest of body and tail green", and stated it was based on descriptions from voyages to <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> in the 17th and early 18th century.

The two assigned "Necropsittacus" species have since become the source of much taxonomic confusion, and their identities have been debated. "N. borbonicus" later received <a href="common%20names">common names</a> such as Réunion red and green parakeet or Réunion parrot, and "N. francicus" has been called the Mauritian parrot. The Japanese ornithologist <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> recognised "N. borbonicus" in 1953, and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by Dubois and the body-plan of the Rodrigues parrot. He did not find the naming of "N. francicus" to have been necessary, but expressed hope more evidence would be found. In 1967, the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> suggested that "N. borbonicus" may have been an escaped pet <a href="lory">lory</a> seen by Dubois, since 16th century Dutch paintings show the somewhat similar East Indian <a href="chattering%20lory">chattering lory</a> ("Lorius garrulus"), presumably in captivity. However, Greenway was unable to find any references that matched those Rothschild had given for "N. francicus".

In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke found the described colour-pattern of "N. borbonicus" remiscent of "Psittacula" parrots, but considered "N. francicus" to be based on confused reports. In 2001 the British writer <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a> suggested Dubois' account of "N. borbonicus" could either have referred to an otherwise unrecorded species or have been misleading, and found "N. francicus" to be "one of the most dubious of all hypothetical species". In 2007, Hume suggested that Rothschild had associated "N. borbonicus" with the Rodrigues parrot because he had mistakenly incorporated Dubois' account into his description of the latter; he stated the Rodrigues parrot also had red plumage (though it was all-green), and had been mentioned by Dubois (who never visited Rodrigues). Rothschild also attributed the sighting of "N. francicus" to Dubois, repeating the colour-pattern he had described earlier for the Rodrigues parrot, and this lead Hume to conclude that the name "N. francicus" was based solely on "the muddled imagination of Lord Rothschild". Hume added that if Dubois' description of "N. borbonicus" was based on a parrot endemic to Réunion, it may have been derived from the <a href="Alexandrine%20parakeet">Alexandrine parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eupatria"), which has a similar colouration, apart from the red tail.

The Rodrigues parrot was described as being the largest parrot species on the island, with a big head and a long tail. Its plumage was described as being of uniform green colouration. Its skull was flat and depressed compared to those of most other parrots, but similar to the genus "<a href="Ara%20%28genus%29">Ara</a>". The skull was long without the beak, wide, and deep. The <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> (part of the shoulder) was long, the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper-arm bone) , the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> (lower-arm bone) , the <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh-bone) , the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (lower-leg bone) , and the <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> (foot bone) . Its exact body length is unknown, but it may have been around , comparable to the size of a large <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a>. Its tibia was 32% smaller than that of a female broad-billed parrot, yet the pectoral bones were of similar size, and proportionally its head was the largest of any Mascarene species of parrot.

The skeleton of the Rodrigues parrot had similarities with the "<a href="Tanygnathus">Tanygnathus</a>" and "Psittacula" parrot genera. The pectoral and <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> bones were similar in size to those of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20kaka">New Zealand kaka</a> ("Nestor meridionalis"), and it may have looked similar to the <a href="great-billed%20parrot">great-billed parrot</a> ("Tanygnathus megalorynchos") in life, but with a larger head and tail. It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several skeletal features, including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards. No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups.

Tafforet's 1726 description is the only detailed account of the Rodrigues parrot in life:

Tafforet also mentioned that the parrots ate the seeds of the "<a href="Fernelia%20buxifolia">Fernelia buxifolia</a>" shrub ("bois de buis"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Due to a large population of introduced rats on Rodrigues, the parrots, the <a href="Rodrigues%20starling">Rodrigues starling</a> ("Necropsar rodericanus"), and the <a href="Rodrigues%20pigeon">Rodrigues pigeon</a> ("Nesoenas rodericanus"), frequented and nested on offshore islets, where the rats were absent.

Many other of the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of the island is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The Rodrigues parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a> ("Pezophaps solitaria"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20rail">Rodrigues rail</a> ("Erythromachus leguati"), Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the <a href="Rodrigues%20owl">Rodrigues owl</a> ("Mascarenotus murivorus"), the <a href="Rodrigues%20night%20heron">Rodrigues night heron</a> ("Nycticorax megacephalus"), and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the <a href="domed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">domed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a> ("Cylindraspis peltastes"), the <a href="saddle-backed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a> ("Cylindraspis vosmaeri"), and the <a href="Rodrigues%20day%20gecko">Rodrigues day gecko</a> ("Phelsuma edwardnewtoni").

Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the <a href="echo%20parakeet">echo parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques echo") of Mauritius has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Like mainland Rodrigues, the offshore islets were eventually infested by rats as well, and this is believed to be the reason for the demise of the Rodrigues parrot and other birds there. The rats probably preyed on their eggs and chicks. Pingré indicated that local species were popular <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">game</a>, and found that the Rodrigues parrot was rare:

Pingré also reported that the island was becoming deforested by <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct hunting of the parrots, this likely led to a reduction in the population of Rodrigues parrots. Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and it probably became extinct soon after.

Cretan War (205–200 BC)

The Cretan War (205–200 BC) was fought by King <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a>, the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>, many Cretan cities (of which <a href="Olous">Olous</a> and <a href="Ierapetra">Hierapytna</a> were the most important) and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n pirates against the forces of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> and later <a href="Attalus%20I">Attalus I</a> of <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>, <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, and <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>.

The Macedonians had just concluded the <a href="First%20Macedonian%20War">First Macedonian War</a> and Philip, seeing his chance to defeat Rhodes, formed an alliance with Aetolian and Spartan <a href="pirate">pirate</a>s who began raiding Rhodian ships. Philip also formed an alliance with several important Cretan cities, such as Hierapytna and Olous. With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates, Philip believed his chance to crush Rhodes was at hand. To help achieve his goal, he formed an alliance with the King of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, <a href="Antiochus%20the%20Great">Antiochus the Great</a>, against <a href="Ptolemy%20V">Ptolemy V</a> of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Egypt</a> (the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two <a href="Diadochi">Diadochi</a> states). Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes's allies in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and around the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Propontis</a>.

In 202 BC, Rhodes and her allies Pergamum, Cyzicus, and Byzantium combined their fleets and defeated Philip at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chios%20%28201%20BC%29">Battle of Chios</a>. Just a few months later, Philip's fleet defeated the Rhodians <a href="Battle%20of%20Lade%20%28201%20BC%29">at Lade</a>. While Philip was plundering Pergamese territory and attacking cities in Caria, Attalus I of Pergamum went to Athens to try to create a diversion. He succeeded in securing an alliance with the Athenians, who immediately declared war on the Macedonians. The King of Macedon could not remain inactive; he assailed Athens with his navy and with some infantry. The Romans warned him, however, to withdraw or face war with <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Rhodian and Pergamese fleets, Philip withdrew, but not before attacking the city of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a> on the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. Abydos fell after a long siege and most of its inhabitants committed suicide. Philip rejected the Roman ultimatum to stop attacking Greek states and the Romans declared war on Macedon. This left the Cretan cities with no major allies, and the largest city of Crete, Knossos, joined the Rhodians. Faced with this combination, both Hierapytna and Olous surrendered and were forced to sign a treaty favourable to Rhodes and Knossos.

In 205 BC, the <a href="First%20Macedonian%20War">First Macedonian War</a> came to an end with the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Phoenice">Treaty of Phoenice</a>, under the terms of which the Macedonians were not allowed to expand westwards. Rome, meanwhile, was preoccupied with <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a>, and Philip hoped to take advantage of this to seize control of the Greek world. He knew that his ambitions would be aided by an alliance with Crete and began pressing the Cretans to attack Rhodian assets. Having crushed <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, the dominant Greek state in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and formed an alliance with <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a>, Philip was now opposed by no major Greek power other than <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. Rhodes, an island state that dominated the south-eastern Mediterranean economically and militarily, was formally allied to Philip, but was also allied to his enemy <a href="Roman%20Republic">Rome</a>. Furthermore, Philip worked towards consolidating his position as the major power in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. Marching his forces to Macedon's northern frontier, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>, who lost 10,000 men in battle. With his northern frontier secured, Philip was able to turn his attention towards the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Phoenice">Treaty of Phoenice</a> prohibited Philip from expanding westward into Illyria or the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, so the king turned his attentions eastwards to the Aegean Sea, where he started to build a large fleet.

Philip saw two ways of shaking Rhodes' dominance of the sea: piracy and war. Deciding to use both methods, he encouraged his allies to begin pirate attacks against Rhodian ships. Having already a foothold in Crete since the <a href="Lyttian%20War">Lyttian War</a>, Philip convinced the <a href="Cretans">Cretans</a>, who had been involved in piracy for a long time. He also persuaded the Aetolians, and the <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>ns to take part in the piracy. The lure for these nations was the promise of vast loot from captured Rhodian vessels. He sent the Aetolian freebooter <a href="Dicaearchus%20of%20Aetolia">Dicaearchus</a> on a large <a href="Raid%20%28military%29">razzia</a> through the Aegean, during the course of which he plundered the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a> and Rhodian territories. Additionally, Philip sought to weaken the Rhodians' naval capacity through subterfuge. He achieved this by sending his agent <a href="Heracleides%20of%20Tarentum">Heracleides</a> to Rhodes where he succeeded in burning 13 boat-sheds.

By the end of 205 BC, Rhodes had been significantly weakened by these raids, and Philip saw his chance to go forward with the second part of his plan, direct military confrontation. He convinced the cities of Hierapytna and Olous and other cities in Eastern Crete to declare war against Rhodes.

Rhodes' initial response to the declaration of war was diplomatic; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> and <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> had joined the war on the Rhodians side, but was unable to sway the city's war-weary population.

At this point Philip further provoked Rhodes by attacking <a href="Cius">Cius</a>, which was an Aetolian-allied city on the coast of the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. Despite attempts by Rhodes and other states to mediate a settlement, Philip captured and razed Cius as well as its neighbour <a href="Myrleia">Myrleia</a>. Philip then handed these cities over to his brother-in-law, the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Bithynia">King of Bithynia</a>, <a href="Prusias%20I">Prusias I</a> who rebuilt and renamed the cities Prusa after himself and Apameia after his wife, respectively. In return for these cities Prusias promised that he would continue on expanding his kingdom at the expense of Pergamum (his latest war with Pergamum had ended in 205). The seizure of these cities also enraged the Aetolians, as both were members of the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>. The alliance between Aetolia and Macedon was held together only by the Aetolians' fear of Philip, and this incident worsened the already tenuous relationship. Philip next compelled the cities of <a href="Lysimachia%20%28Thrace%29">Lysimachia</a> and <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a>, which were also members of the Aetolian League, to break off their alliance with Aetolia probably through the threatened use of violence.

On the way home, Philip's fleet stopped at the island of <a href="Thasos">Thasos</a> off the coast of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. Philip's general <a href="Metrodorus%20%28general%29">Metrodorus</a>, went to the island's eponymous capital to meet emissaries from the city. The envoys said they would surrender the city to the Macedonians on the conditions that they not receive a <a href="garrison">garrison</a>, that they not have to pay <a href="tribute">tribute</a> or contribute soldiers to the Macedonian army and that they continue to use their own laws. Metrodorus replied that the king accepted the terms, and the Thasians opened their gates to the Macedonians. Once within the walls, however, Philip ordered his soldiers to enslave all the citizens, who were then sold away, and to loot the city. Philip's action during this campaign had a drastic impact on his reputation amongst the Greek states, where his actions were considered to be no better than the savage raids of the Aetolians and the Romans during the First Macedonian War.

In 204 BC or the spring of 203 BC, Philip was approached by <a href="Sosibius">Sosibius</a> and <a href="Agathocles%20of%20Egypt">Agathocles of Egypt</a>, the ministers of the young pharaoh <a href="Ptolemy%20V">Ptolemy V</a>. The ministers sought to arrange a marriage between Ptolemy and Philip's daughter in order to form an alliance against <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III the Great</a>, emperor of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, who was seeking to expand his empire at Egypt's expense. Philip, however, declined the proposal and in the winter of 203 BC-202 BC, he formed an alliance with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire. Philip agreed to help Antiochus to seize <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, while Antiochus promised to help Philip take control of <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene</a>, the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a> and <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>.

In late 202 BC, the Aetolians sent ambassadors to Rome in order to form an alliance against Philip. Macedonian aggression had convinced the Aetolian League that they needed additional protectors in order to maintain their current position. However, the Romans rebuffed the Aetolian envoys as they were still seething about the fact that the Aetolians had come to terms with Philip to end the First Macedonian War. The unsupportive attitude of Rome encouraged Philip to continue with his Aegean campaign. Philip considered control of the Aegean to be paramount in maintaining his regional dominance. By ruling the Aegean he would be able to isolate Pergamum as well as restrict Roman attempts to interfere in the Eastern Mediterranean.

With the Seleucid treaty concluded, Philip's army attacked Ptolemy's territories in Thrace. Upon hearing that the King of <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a>, <a href="Attalus%20I">Attalus I</a>, had joined the Rhodian alliance, Philip became enraged and invaded Pergamese territory. However, before having set out to campaign against Philip's navy in the Aegean Sea, Attalus had strengthened the city walls of his capital. By taking this and other precautions, he hoped to prevent Philip from a seizing a large amount of booty from his territory. Seeing that the city was undermanned, he sent his skirmishers against it, but they were easily repelled. Judging that the city walls were too strong, Philip retreated after destroying a few temples, including the temple of <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> and the sanctuary of <a href="Athena">Athena</a> Nicephorus. After the Macedonians captured Thyatira, they advanced to plunder the plain of Thebe, but the booty proved less fruitful than anticipated. Once he arrived at Thebe, he demanded supplies from the <a href="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> governor of the region, <a href="Zeuxis%20%28general%29">Zeuxis</a>. Zeuxis, however, never planned to give Philip substantial supplies.

After withdrawing from Pergamese land, Philip with the Macedonian fleet headed south and after subduing the Cyclades, took the island of <a href="Samos%20Island">Samos</a> from Ptolemy V, capturing the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> fleet stationed there. The fleet then turned north and laid siege to the island of <a href="Chios">Chios</a>. Philip was planning to use the northern Aegean islands as stepping-stones as he worked his way down to Rhodes. The siege was not going well for Philip and the situation worsened as the combined fleets of Pergamum, Rhodes and their new allies, <a href="Kos">Kos</a>, Cyzicus and Byzantium approached from both the north and south. Philip, comprehending that the allies were attempting to seal his line of retreat, lifted the siege and began to sail for a friendly harbour. However, he was confronted by the allied fleet, precipitating the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chios%20%28201%20BC%29">Battle of Chios</a>.

The Macedonian fleet of around 200 ships, manned by 30,000 men, significantly outnumbered the coalition's fleet of sixty-five large warships, nine medium vessels and three <a href="triremes">triremes</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Chios%20%28201%20BC%29">battle</a> began with Attalus, who was commanding the allied left wing, advancing against the Macedonian right wing, while the allied right flank under the command of the Rhodian admiral <a href="Theophiliscus">Theophiliscus</a> attacked the Macedonian's left wing. The allies gained the upper hand on their left flank and captured Philip's flagship; Philip's admiral, Democrates, was slain in the fighting. Meanwhile, on the allied right flank, the Macedonians were initially successful in pushing the Rhodians back. Theophiliscus, fighting on his flagship, received three fatal wounds but managed to rally his men and defeat the Macedonian boarders. The Rhodians were able to use their superior navigational skills to incapacitate large numbers of Macedonian ships, swinging the battle back into their favour.

On the allied left flank, Attalus saw one of his ships being sunk by the enemy and the one next to it in danger. He decided to sail to the rescue with two quadriremes and his flagship. Philip, however, whose ship had not been involved in the fighting to this point, saw that Attalus had strayed some distance from his fleet and sailed to attack him with four <a href="quinqueremes">quinqueremes</a> and three hemioliae. Attalus, seeing Philip approaching, fled in terror and was forced to run his ships aground. Upon landing he spread coins, purple robes and other splendid articles on the deck of his ship and fled to the city of <a href="Erythrae">Erythrae</a>. When the Macedonians arrived at the shore, they stopped to collect the plunder. Philip, thinking that Attalus had perished in the chase, started towing away the Pergamese flagship.

Following the flight of their monarch, the Pergamese fleet withdrew north. However, having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing, the Macedonian left wing disengaged and retreated to join its victorious right flank. The withdrawal of the Macedonian left permitted the Rhodians to sail unmolested back into Chios' harbour.

While the battle was not decisive, it was a significant setback for Philip, who lost 92 ships destroyed and 7 captured. On the allied side, the Pergamese had three ships destroyed and two captured, while the Rhodians lost three ships sunk and none captured. During the battle the Macedonians lost 6,000 rowers and 3,000 marines killed and had 2,000 men captured. The casualties for the allies were significantly lower, with the Pergamese losing 70 men the Rhodians 60 killed, the allies as a whole losing 600 captured. Peter Green describes this defeat as "crippling and costly", with Philip sustaining more casualties than he had previously suffered in any battle.

After this battle, the Rhodian admirals decided to leave Chios and sail back home. On the way back to Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he received at Chios, but before he died he appointed <a href="Cleonaeus">Cleonaeus</a> as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> on the shore of Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lade%20%28202%20BC%29">Battle of Lade</a> and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone.

Philip, disappointed by the spoils in <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of <a href="Caria">Caria</a>. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or they would all be killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army was running out of food, so he seized the city of <a href="Myus">Myus</a> and gave it to the <a href="Magnetes">Magnesians</a> in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of <a href="Iasos">Iasos</a>, <a href="Bargylia">Bargylia</a>, <a href="Euromus">Euromus</a> and Pedasa in quick succession.

While Philip's fleet was wintering in Bargylia, the combined Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour. The situation in the Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering. The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis. Philip, however, managed to get out by trickery. He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians to say that he was preparing to attack the allies the next day. Upon hearing the news, Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack. While the allies were making their preparations, Philip slipped past them by night with his fleet, leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp.

While Philip was involved in this campaign, his allies the <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>ns became involved in a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes. The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation, and he decided to send a force under the command of <a href="Nicanor%20the%20Elephant">Nicanor the Elephant</a> to assist them in their attack on Attica. The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the <a href="Platonic%20Academy">Academy of Athens</a> when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome.

Philip's fleet had just escaped from the allied blockade and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens. The Macedonian squadron sailed into <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> and captured four Athenian ships. As the Macedonian squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, appeared from the allied base at <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a> and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which they returned to the Athenians. The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians.

The Pergamese fleet sailed back to their base at Aegina and the Rhodians set out to conquer all the Macedonian islands from Aegina to Rhodes, successfully assaulting all except <a href="Andros">Andros</a>, <a href="Paros">Paros</a> and Cythnos. Philip ordered his <a href="prefect">prefect</a> on the island of <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>, <a href="Philoces">Philoces</a>, to assault Athens once again with 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Philocles was unable to capture Athens, but ravaged the surrounding countryside.

Meanwhile, Rhodian, Pergamese, Egyptian, anti-Macedonian Cretan and Athenian delegations travelled to Rome to appear before the Senate. When they were given audience they informed the Senate about the treaty between Philip and Antiochus and complained of Philip's attacks on their territories. In response to these complaints the Romans sent three ambassadors, <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28187%20BC%29">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a>, <a href="Gaius%20Claudius%20Nero">Gaius Claudius Nero</a> and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus to Egypt with the orders to go to Rhodes after speaking with Ptolemy.
While this was happening, Philip attacked and occupied the cities in Thrace which still belonged to Ptolemy, <a href="Maroneia">Maroneia</a>, <a href="Cypsela%20%28Thrace%29">Cypsela</a>, <a href="Doriscus">Doriscus</a>, <a href="Serrheum">Serrheum</a> and <a href="Aemus">Aemus</a>. The Macedonians then advanced on the <a href="Thracian%20Chersonese">Thracian Chersonese</a> where they captured the cities of <a href="Perinthus">Perinthus</a>, <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a>, <a href="Elaeus">Elaeus</a>, <a href="Alopeconnesus">Alopeconnesus</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Callipolis</a> and Madytus. Philip then descended to the city of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a>, which was held by a combined Pergamese and Rhodian garrison. Philip started the siege by blockading the city by land and sea to stop attempts to reinforce or supply the city. The Abydenians, full of confidence, dislodged some of the siege engines with their own <a href="catapult">catapult</a>s while some of Philip's other engines were burnt by the defenders. With their siege weaponry in tatters, the Macedonians started undermining the city's walls, eventually succeeding in collapsing the outer wall.

The situation was now grave for the defenders and they decided to send two of their most prominent citizens to Philip as negotiators. Appearing before Philip, these men offered to surrender the city to him on the conditions that the Rhodian and the Pergamese garrisons were allowed to leave the city under a truce and that all the citizens were permitted to leave the city with the clothes they were wearing and go wherever they pleased, in effect meaning an unconditional surrender. Philip replied that they should "surrender at discretion or fight like men." The ambassadors, powerless to do more, carried this response back to the city.'

Informed of this response, the city's leaders called an assembly to determine their course of action. They decided to liberate all slaves to secure their loyalty, to place all the children and their nurses in the gymnasium and to put all the women in the temple of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. They also asked for everyone to bring forward their gold and silver and any clothes that were valuable so they could put them in the boats of the Rhodians and the Cyzicenes. Fifty elder and trusted men were elected to carry out these tasks. All the citizens then swore an oath. As Polybius writes:
After reciting the oath, they brought forward the priests and everyone swore that they would defeat the enemy or die trying.'

When the interior wall fell, the men, true to their promise, sprang from the ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip to send his troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp. That night the Abydenians resolved to save the women and children and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians, surrendering the city to Philip.

Meanwhile, Attalus sailed across the Aegean to the island of <a href="Ancient%20Tenedos">Tenedos</a>. The youngest of the Roman ambassadors, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, had heard about the siege at Abydos while he was in Rhodes and he arrived at Abydos to find Philip. Meeting the king outside the city, Lepidus informed him of the Senate's wishes. Polybius writes:

While Philip was walking through Abydos, he saw people killing themselves and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three days' grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.

Philip then ordered another attack on Athens; his army failed to take either Athens or <a href="Eleusis">Eleusis</a>, but subjected Attica to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign in order to deal with the Romans and the situation in Greece. Thus began the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>.

After Philip's withdrawal from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians were free to attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other <a href="Cretan">Cretan</a> allies. Rhodes' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a> saw that the war was going in Rhodes' favour and decided to join Rhodes in an attempt to gain <a href="supremacism">supremacy</a> over the island. Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.

Under the treaty signed at the conclusion of the war, Hierapytna agreed to break off all relations and alliances with foreign powers and to place all its harbors and bases at Rhodes' disposal. Olous, among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found, had to accept Rhodian domination. As a result, Rhodes was left with control of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war. The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War.

The war had no particular short-term effect on the rest of Crete. Pirates and <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> there continued in their old occupations after the war's end. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Battle of Cynoscephalae</a> during the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a> three years later, Cretan mercenary <a href="archery">archers</a> fought for both the Romans and the Macedonians.

The war was costly for Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet that had taken three years to build as well as triggering the defection of their Greek allies, the <a href="Achean%20League">Achean League</a> and the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>, to the Romans. In the war's immediate aftermath the <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a>, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the northern border of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans and was forced to surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.

The Rhodians regained control over the Cyclades and reconfirmed their naval supremacy over the Aegean. The Rhodians' possession of eastern Crete allowed them to largely stamp out piracy in that area, but pirate attacks on Rhodian shipping continued and eventually led to the <a href="Second%20Cretan%20War">Second Cretan War</a>. Attalus died in 197 and was succeeded by his son, <a href="Eumenes%20II">Eumenes II</a>, who continued his father's anti-Macedonian policy. The Pergamese, meanwhile, came out of the war having gained several Aegean islands which had been in Philip's possession and went on to become the supreme power in Asia Minor, rivaled only by Antiochus.

Russian battleship Poltava (1894)

The Russian <a href="battleship">battleship</a> Poltava () was one of three <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> in the 1890s. The ship was transferred to the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Squadron</a> shortly after completion and based at <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> from 1901. During the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05, she participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> and was heavily damaged during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a>. She was sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Siege of Port Arthur</a> in December 1904, but was <a href="Marine%20salvage">raised</a> by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) after the war and renamed "Tango" (丹後).

During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tsingtao">Siege of Tsingtao</a>. The Japanese government sold "Tango" back to the Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed "Chesma" (Чесма) as her former name had been given to a new ship. En route to the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a>, she joined an <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied force</a> that <a href="Noemvriana">persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships</a>. Her crew declared for the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided to <a href="North%20Russia%20Intervention">intervene in the Russian Civil War</a> in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a <a href="prison%20hulk">prison hulk</a>. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in 1924.

The design of the was derived from the battleship , but was greatly enlarged to accommodate an armament of four and eight guns. While under construction their armament was revised to consist of more powerful 12-inch guns and the 8-inch guns were replaced by a dozen guns. The ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . Designed to displace , "Poltava" was over overweight and displaced when completed. The ship was powered by two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, built by the British firm <a href="Humphrys%2C%20Tennant%20and%20Dykes">Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes</a>, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 14 <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of , but "Poltava" reached a speed of from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at a speed of . Her crew consisted of 26–27 officers and 605–625 enlisted men.

The "Petropavlovsk"-class ships' <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of four <a href="Russian%2012%20inch%2040%20caliber%20naval%20gun">12-inch</a> guns mounted in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one forward and one aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Designed to fire one round per 90 seconds, the actual rate of fire was half that. Their <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of twelve <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">six-inch</a> <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) gun</a>s. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s on the sides of the hull <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. Smaller guns were carried for defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, including a dozen QF <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s and twenty-eight <a href="Hiram%20Maxim">Maxim</a> QF <a href="QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom">guns</a>. They were also armed with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four tubes above water and two submerged tubes, all mounted on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. They carried 50 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be used to protect her <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">anchorage</a>.

"Poltava" was the first Russian battleship to use <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a>, imported from Germany. Her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick. The Krupp armor of her main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of and the <a href="nickel-steel">nickel-steel</a> armor of her protective <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>s ranged from in thickness.

"Poltava" was named for the victory at the 1709 <a href="Battle%20of%20Poltava">Battle of Poltava</a> when <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a> defeated King <a href="Charles%20XII%20of%20Sweden">Charles XII of Sweden</a>. Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes and late delivery of the main armament, the ship was under construction for six years. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> on 19 May 1892, together with her two <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, at the New <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyard">Admiralty Shipyard</a> and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 6 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>. Together with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> , "Poltava" had a radio installed in September 1900, the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to get such equipment. On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition, coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough to pass through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. "Poltava" arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901, the day before her sister.

After the Japanese victory in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–1895, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and Korea, resulting in tensions between the two nations. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The situation was worsened by Russia's failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. The final straws were the news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These actions caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was inevitable. As tensions with Japan increased, the Pacific Squadron began <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring</a> in the outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">surprise attack</a> on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. "Poltava" was not hit by the initial attack by torpedo boats and <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d the following morning when the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, commanded by <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, attacked. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. "Poltava" was hit several times with little effect and only three men wounded. She fired 12 twelve-inch and 55 six-inch shells during the battle.

"Poltava" participated in the action of 13 April, when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral <a href="Stepan%20Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a>'s <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, her sister . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship struck a <a href="minefield">minefield</a> laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, Tōgō resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two of his battleships the following month.

Rear Admiral <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a> became the new commander of the First Pacific Squadron and led a half-hearted attempt to reach <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> on 23 June; intercepted by the Combined Fleet, he returned to Port Arthur without engaging the Japanese ships. "Poltava", together with cruisers and destroyers, sortied to bombard Japanese coast defense positions on 9 July and briefly engaged Japanese ships that intercepted her. During the summer, the ship landed many of her 47 mm and 37 mm guns to reinforce the defenses of the port.

On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, which had been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began an assault on the city's outer defenses. With their base now directly under attack, the First Pacific Squadron sortied in the morning, around 07:00, in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok. The Japanese fleet intercepted the Russian ships at 12:55 in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea.

"Poltava" was sixth in the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her position started to bombard at around 14:45. The battleship , the Japanese flagship, then fired several shots that hit "Poltava", causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her. The Russians scored several hits on "Mikasa", including two by "Poltava". She also scored one hit on the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> . Owing to the damage "Mikasa" had sustained, the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15:20 and turned to starboard, opening the range. By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear. "Mikasa" and three other battleships opened fire on "Poltava" and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with and "Asahi" firing on "Poltava". As the Russian fleet began to slip away, two 12-inch shells from "Asahi" penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind "Tsesarevich", including "Poltava", to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Prince <a href="Pavel%20Ukhtomsky">Pavel Ukhtomsky</a>, second in command of the squadron, signaled the other Russian ships to steam back to Port Arthur. The signal flags were only gradually recognized by "Pobeda", "Sevastopol", "Pallada" and "Poltava" and the other vessels took some time to re-form for the return voyage. "Poltava" was hit by 12 to 14 large-caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6-inch guns, as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43. "Poltava", along with "Tsesarevich" and , sustained hits at the waterline that crippled their maneuverability, preventing the Russian squadron from fleeing to Vladivostok.

Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the <a href="Japanese%20Third%20Army">Japanese Third Army</a> led by <a href="Baron">Baron</a> <a href="Nogi%20Maresuke">Nogi Maresuke</a>. "Poltava" was hit on 18 August by four shells, fired by a battery, that wounded six men. The new squadron commander, Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20Viren">Robert N. Viren</a>, believed in reinforcing the landward defenses of the port and continued to strip guns, and sailors to man them, from his ships. By September "Poltava" had lost a total of three 6-inch, four 47 mm and twenty-six 37 mm guns. That same month, she began bombarding Japanese positions; through November she fired one hundred ten 12-inch shells and an unknown number of 6-inch shells.

In October the advancing Third Army began to bombard the harbor with siege howitzers, firing at random. They hit "Poltava" twice on 7 October, though the shells only started fires. On 5 December the Japanese captured <a href="203%20Hill">203 Meter Hill</a>, a crucial position that overlooked the harbor and allowed them to direct their artillery at the Russian ships. "Poltava" was hit that same day by five shells, three of which penetrated the deck. One hit a torpedo room, and another burst in the aft 47 mm magazine. That started a fire that could not be put out because the flooding system had been previously damaged and eventually ignited propellant charges in the adjacent 12-inch magazine. About a half-hour after the hit, the magazine exploded and blew a hole in the ship's bottom that caused her to sink 45 minutes later in the shallow water.

Following the capitulation of Port Arthur in January 1905, Japanese engineers refloated "Poltava" on 22 July, and commissioned her as "Tango" a month later, taking her name from the <a href="old%20provinces%20of%20Japan">ancient Japanese province</a> of <a href="Tango%20Province">Tango</a>, now a part of <a href="Kyoto%20Prefecture">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Classified as a 1st class battleship, she departed for <a href="Maizuru%20Naval%20Arsenal">Maizuru Naval Arsenal</a> two days later and arrived on 29 August. Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905, she remained there under repair until November 1907. "Tango" then sailed to <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> to complete fitting out.

The IJN made several changes to the ship as she was repaired. Her <a href="fighting%20top">fighting top</a> was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. She retained her main guns, but their <a href="breech-loading%20weapon">breech</a>es were replaced by Japanese-built ones. Her secondary armament of eight 152 mm guns in twin turrets were retained, while her four casemated 152 mm guns were replaced by six Japanese-built <a href="15%20cm/45%2041st%20Year%20Type">15 cm/45 41st Year Type</a> guns; her light armament was revised to ten <a href="QF%2012%20pounder%2012-cwt%20naval%20gun">QF 12-pounder 12 cwt</a> and four 37 mm guns. Four <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch</a> above-water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen.

"Tango" joined the fleet in 1911 and was re-classified as a 1st class coast defense ship in 1912. In 1913 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers as part of the "enemy" force. She was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="Kato%20Sadakichi">Kato Sadakichi</a>, shortly after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> began. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of <a href="Tsingtao">Tsingtao</a>, China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. "Tango" and the other ships of the squadron bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November.

In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>s. As Japan and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold "Tango" and some other ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and was turned over to the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former name had been given to the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> <a href="Russian%20battleship%20Poltava%20%281911%29">"Poltava"</a>, so "Tango" was renamed "Chesma", after the 1770 <a href="Battle%20of%20Chesma">Battle of Chesma</a>. She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, Egypt, on 19 September.

"Chesma" joined the Allied fleet off <a href="Salamis%20Island">Salamis</a> demanding the disarmament of the Greek fleet later that month and departed after the Greeks agreed to meet the Allied demands. Her machinery was overhauled at <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> by <a href="Cammell%20Laird">Cammell Laird</a>, beginning on 5 December, and her main deck six-inch and 12-pounder guns were removed. In exchange she received four <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s mounted on her superstructure. She arrived at <a href="Alexandrovsk%2C%20Murmansk%20Oblast">Aleksandrovsk</a>, a port in the <a href="Murmansk%20Oblast">Murmansk Oblast</a>, on 16 January 1917 and the political situation became very confused with the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> shortly after her arrival. She was assigned to the <a href="White%20Sea%20Fleet">White Sea Fleet</a> on 3 February. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October, but made no effort to interfere with the <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">Allied landing</a> at <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> in March 1918. Although the ship was deemed "aground and unseaworthy" by the British shortly afterwards, they seized the ship and used her as a floating prison in April 1919 to house 40 Bolshevik prisoners. After the British withdrew, the abandoned ship was captured by the Red Army in March 1920 and incorporated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla on 24 April. No longer of any military value, she was turned over to the port of <a href="Archangelsk">Archangelsk</a> on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the <a href="navy%20list">list of naval vessels</a> on 3 July 1924, after which she was scrapped.

Banksia aculeata

Banksia aculeata, commonly known as prickly banksia, is a <a href="species">species</a> of plant of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> in the <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. A shrub up to tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly <a href="Serration">serrated</a> margins. Its unusual pinkish, <a href="pendent">pendent</a> (hanging) flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> in the 1840s, "Banksia aculeata" was not <a href="species%20description">formally described</a> until 1981, by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> in his monograph of the genus.

A rare plant, "Banksia aculeata" is found in gravelly soils in elevated areas. Native to a habitat burnt by periodic <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfires</a>, it is killed by fire and regenerates from seed afterwards. In contrast to other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>".

A bushy <a href="shrub">shrub</a>, "Banksia aculeata" grows up to tall, with fissured grey bark on its trunk and branches. Unlike many other banksia species, it does not have a woody base, or <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. The leaves range from long and wide, with sharply pointed rigid lobes on the margins. Appearing in February and March, the cylindrical flower spikes—known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s—range from long, growing at the ends of short leafy 2–3-year-old side branches. Hanging downward rather than growing upright like those of most other banksias, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, from which many compact individual flowers arise perpendicularly. These floral units are made up of a smooth tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> that envelops the flower's sexual organs. The perianth is long and pink at the base grading into cream. In late bud, the end of the perianth has a characteristic four-angled (squarish) appearance. It then splits at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a> to reveal the smooth straight <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">pistil</a>, which is slightly shorter than its enveloping structure at long. The fruiting cone, known as an <a href="infructescence">infructescence</a>, is a swollen woody spike in which up to 20 massive <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> are embedded; the withered flower parts persist on the spike, giving it a hairy appearance. Oval in shape, the follicles are wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair. They are long, high, and wide.

The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) seed is long and fairly flattened. It is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body (containing the <a href="Plant%20embryogenesis">embryonic</a> plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey and wrinkled and the other is black and sparkles slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Known as <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s, the first pair of leaves produced by seedlings are cuneate (wedge-shaped) and measure long by wide. They are dull dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and the margin of the wedge is convex. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is thick, smooth and dark red. The obovate to oblong seedling leaves are long by wide with serrated margins, v-shaped <a href="sinus%20%28botany%29">sinuses</a> and sharp teeth.

The related "<a href="Banksia%20caleyi">Banksia caleyi</a>" is similar in appearance but can be distinguished by its recurved (downward curving) leaf margins, and smaller follicles and perianths. Its flowers appear from October to December.

"Banksia aculeata" was first collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> on one of his three trips to the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a> between 1843 and 1848, though he did not regard it as distinct from "<a href="Banksia%20caleyi">B. caleyi</a>"—this was only recognised over a century later by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>. George <a href="Species%20description">described</a> "B. aculeata" in his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". For the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> of the species, George selected a specimen he collected on Chester Pass Road in the Stirling Range east of <a href="Cranbrook%2C%20Western%20Australia">Cranbrook</a> on 20 March 1972. He gave it the <a href="Botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> "aculeata" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "sharp"), in reference to the sharply pointed leaf lobes.

George placed "B. aculeata" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike; in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="Gynoecium">styles</a>; and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Tetragonae">"B." ser. "Tetragonae"</a> because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be "B. caleyi", from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published the results of a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of "Banksia". They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's "B." ser. "Tetragonae" was found to be <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of "B. aculeata" alongside "B. caleyi".

"B. aculeata"s placement in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George and was discarded in his 1999 revision.
Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a>, "B. aculeata"s placement was as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of "B. aculeata" alongside "B. caleyi" in a clade corresponding closely with "B." ser. "Tetragonae". A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results found that "B. aculeata" was sister to "B. lemanniana" and that "B. caleyi" was the next closest relative.

Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. aculeata" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"B. aculeata" is native to the foothills of the Stirling Range in the <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, occurring at elevations between , in shrubland in gravelly, clayish soils. The annual rainfall is around . It is a fairly rare plant, with most populations consisting of fewer than 100 plants. With fairly small populations and a narrow distribution, "B. aculeata" is considered rare, but is not currently classed as endangered because at least some populations are thought not to be under immediate threat. The <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Environment and Conservation</a> of the Western Australian State Government classes it as "Priority Two – Poorly Known" flora.

Like many plants in Australia's southwest, "Banksia aculeata" is adapted to an environment in which <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "B. aculeata" is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is <a href="serotinous">serotinous</a>—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable <a href="fire%20regime">fire regime</a>. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.

Pollinators have not been observed, and the flowering period is brief when compared with other banksias. However, the flowers appear when little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source for animals.

"B. aculeata" has been reported as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", but in a 2008 study this <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> was found to have no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a very low <a href="extinction">extinction</a> risk.

"Banksia aculeata" grows slowly, generally taking five to six years to flower from seed, though there is a report of it flowering in three years at <a href="Strathmerton">Strathmerton</a> in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an <a href="ornamental%20plant">ornamental plant</a>, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal <a href="soil%20pH">soil pH</a> range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.

Banksia caleyi

Banksia caleyi, commonly known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody <a href="shrub">shrub</a> of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, has <a href="Serration">serrated</a> leaves and unusual red, <a href="pendent">pendent</a> (hanging) <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s which are generally hidden in the foliage. First <a href="species%20description">described</a> by Scottish naturalist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1830, "Banksia caleyi" was named in honour of the English botanist <a href="George%20Caley">George Caley</a>. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.

Found south and east of the <a href="Stirling%20Ranges">Stirling Ranges</a> through to the vicinity of <a href="Jerramungup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Jerramungup</a>, "Banksia caleyi" grows in a habitat burnt by periodic <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfires</a>. Plants are killed by fire and regenerate by seed afterwards. The species is classified as Not Threatened under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia</a>. In contrast to other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to <a href="wikt%3Adieback">dieback</a> from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", and is comparatively easy to grow in cultivation.

"Banksia caleyi" grows as a many-branched bushy <a href="shrub">shrub</a> to 2 m (7 ft) in height, with crumbly grey bark. Rarely, plants of up to have been found. The new growth is hairy, and generally occurs in summer. The branchlets become smooth after around two years. The stiff leaves are narrowly wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure in length by wide. The leaf margins are <a href="Serration">serrated</a>, with many teeth measuring each.

Flowering takes place between September and January. The <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s hang down from the ends of three- to five-year-old branchlets deep within the shrub and measure in length and roughly in diameter. The flowers are cream at the base and deep pink to red in the upper half, and are brightest before <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a> and then gradually fade with age. The inflorescences eventually turn grey, the old flowers remaining as up to 25 large woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop. Oval in shape and covered with fine hair, the follicles can reach long, high, and wide.

The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body proper, measuring long and 1.6–1.7 cm ( in) wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is dark brown and wrinkled, while the other is black and smooth. Both surfaces sparkle slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Seedlings have cuneate <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s which measure long and 1.3–1.4 cm ( in) wide. These are dull green with three veins, and the margin of the wedge may be red and <a href="Glossary%20of%20plant%20morphology%23crenulate">crenulated</a> (lined with small teeth). The <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is red and measures high. Seedlings have hairy stems and leaves that are oppositely arranged (arising from the stem in pairs) that are obovate with triangular-lobed serrate margins.

<a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> formally <a href="Species%20description">described</a> "Banksia caleyi" in his 1830 work "<a href="Supplementum%20primum%20Prodromi%20florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae">Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae</a>", naming it in honour of the English botanist <a href="George%20Caley">George Caley</a>. The type specimen was collected by <a href="William%20Baxter%20%28botanist%29">William Baxter</a>, inland from <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> on Western Australia's south coast, in 1829.

<a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> placed "B. caleyi" in <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">Quercinae</a>" in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus on account of its strongly <a href="Leaf%23Edge%20%28margin%29">dentate</a>, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. Meissner also described "B. caleyi" variety "sinuosa" from material collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a>, which was reviewed by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> and found to be no different from the other collections of "B. caleyi". Drummond also collected material identified as "B. caleyi" that was named as a distinct species—"<a href="Banksia%20aculeata">Banksia aculeata</a>"—in 1981. No subspecies of "B. caleyi" itself are recognised.

<a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> characters. "Banksia caleyi" was placed in section "Orthostylis". In his 1891 work "<a href="Revisio%20Generum%20Plantarum">Revisio Generum Plantarum</a>", German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. caleyi" as "Sirmuellera caleyi". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> in 1940.

In his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", Alex George placed "B. caleyi" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike shape; in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="Gynoecium">style</a>s; and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Tetragonae">"B." ser. "Tetragonae"</a> because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be "B. aculeata", which has narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">pistils</a>; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published the results of a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of "Banksia". They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's "B." ser. "Tetragonae" was found to be <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of "B. caleyi" alongside "B. aculeata".

"B. caleyi"s placement in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George, and was discarded in his 1999 revision. 
Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a>, "B. caleyi"s placement was as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of "B. aculeata" alongside "B. caleyi" in a clade corresponding closely with "B." ser. "Tetragonae".

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They have refrained from publishing a full arrangement of "Banksia" until DNA sampling of "Dryandra" is complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. caleyi" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia caleyi" is found near the southern coast of Western Australia, from <a href="South%20Stirling%2C%20Western%20Australia">South Stirling</a> to the West River and northeast to <a href="Pingrup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Pingrup</a>. Some of its population lies within <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a>. Often locally abundant, it is found in <a href="Mallee%20%28habit%29">mallee</a> woodland on white sand, gravel, and sandy clay, generally on flat or slightly undulating land. The annual rainfall is . "Banksia caleyi" is classified as Not Threatened under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia</a>.

Like many plants in <a href="south-west%20Western%20Australia">south-west Western Australia</a>, "Banksia caleyi" is adapted to an environment in which <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "B. caleyi" belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.

"Banksia caleyi" has been shown to have a low susceptibility to <a href="wikt%3Adieback">dieback</a> from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", unlike many Western Australian banksias. The fungal pathogen "<a href="Botryosphaeria%20ribis">Botryosphaeria ribis</a>" has been recovered from "B. caleyi". The caterpillar of the <a href="dryandra%20moth">dryandra moth</a> ("Carthaea saturnioides") feeds on the leaves, though it prefers to eat those of <a href="dryandra">dryandra</a> species that grow alongside it.

The upside-down flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals which are attracted to the scent. Supporting this hypothesis, the spiky leaves seem to also prevent access to foragers not at ground level. Furthermore, the individual flower structure is similar to "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">Banksia attenuata</a>", for which the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a> ("Tarsipes rostratus") is a major pollinator.

Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a> in cultivation. "Banksia caleyi" is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking four to five years to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal <a href="soil%20pH">soil pH</a> range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, "Banksia caleyi" has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts <a href="pygmy%20possum">pygmy</a> and honey possums in the garden.

Banksia dentata

Banksia dentata, commonly known as the tropical banksia, is a species of tree in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>". It occurs across northern Australia, southern <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Aru%20Islands">Aru Islands</a>. Growing as a gnarled tree to high, it has large green leaves up to long with <a href="wikt%3Adentate">dentate</a> (toothed) <a href="Leaf%23Margins%20%28edge%29">margins</a>. The cylindrical yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s (flower spikes), up to high, appear over the cooler months, attracting various species of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, <a href="sunbird">sunbird</a>s, the <a href="sugar%20glider">sugar glider</a> and a variety of insects. Flowers fall off the ageing spikes, which swell and develop <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> containing up to two viable seeds each.

"Banksia dentata" is one of four "Banksia" species collected by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a>'s original description of "Banksia". Within the genus, it is classified in the <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. <a href="Genetics">Genetic</a> studies show it is a <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> member (early offshoot) within the group. "Banksia dentata" is found in tropical grassland known as <a href="savanna">savanna</a>, associated with "<a href="Pandanus">Pandanus</a>" and "<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>". It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>.

The tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around or sometimes tall, with a rough stocky trunk, spreading <a href="Crown%20%28botany%29">crown</a>, and crooked branches. The dark grey bark is not flaky but <a href="Tessellation%23In%20nature">tesselated</a> in texture and appearance. Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away, branchlets become smooth and grey with age. The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are long and wide, <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> in shape with <a href="wikt%3Amucronate">mucronate</a> tips. The <a href="wikt%3Adentate">dentate</a> (toothed) <a href="Leaf%23Margins%20%28edge%29">margins</a> are lined irregularly with long teeth, separated by u-shaped <a href="Sinus%20%28botany%29">sinuses</a>. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the <a href="wikt%3Amidrib">midrib</a> raised underneath and depressed above. The cylindrical yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s (flower spikes), arise from one- to three-year-old branches. Appearing between November and May, they are high and wide. Newly opened flower spikes smell like <a href="maize">corn</a>. All flower parts are pale yellow; the <a href="perianth">perianth</a> is long, including a long limb. After <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, the <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">pistil</a> is long. Flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes, which develop into irregular-cylindrical <a href="infructescence">infructescence</a>s. The oval <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> are long, high and wide. Pale green and furry when young, they become smooth and pale brown with age. The follicles open spontaneously with maturity. They contain two seeds each, between which lies a woody dark brown <a href="Seed%20separator">separator</a> of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown wide membranous 'wing' and obovate seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges.

The bright green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s are obovate, measuring long by wide. At the base of each are two pointed <a href="Auricle%20%28botany%29">auricles</a> around 1.5 mm long. The cotyledons arise from a 3–4 mm high smooth <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> that is 1–1.5 mm in diameter. The subsequent seedling leaves are opposite initially, arising 3–4 mm above the cotyledons. Each is roughly linear in shape, measuring long and wide, with two to three serrations ("teeth") on the upper quarter to third of the leaf margin's length. The leaf undersurface is covered with white hair. Successive leaves become more obovate and are long and wide, with dentate margins and mucronate tips. Seedling stems are hairy.

Specimens of "Banksia dentata" were collected from the vicinity of the <a href="Endeavour%20River">Endeavour River</a> somewhere between 17 June and 3 August 1770 by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Daniel Solander</a>, naturalists on the "<a href="HM%20Bark%20Endeavour">Endeavour</a>" during Lieutenant (later Captain) <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="James%20Cook%23First%20voyage%20%281768-1771%29">first voyage</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. However, the description of the species was not published until April 1782, when <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a> described the first four "Banksia" species in his "<a href="Supplementum%20Plantarum">Supplementum Plantarum</a>". Linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus this species' dentate (toothed) leaf margins saw it given the specific name "dentata", the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective for "toothed". "Banksia dentata" is <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a>, and no subspecies are recognised. Though not closely studied, reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range.

<a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> recorded 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", and in his <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a>, placed the taxon in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. By the time <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed "B. dentata" in the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">"Quercinae"</a> (the oak-like banksias).

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> characters. "Banksia dentata" was placed in section "Eubanksia" alongside "<a href="Banksia%20marginata">B. marginata</a>" and a broadly defined "B. integrifolia".

A major disruption to "Banksia" nomenclature occurred in 1891, when <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged "Banksia" L.f. on the grounds that <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a> and his son <a href="Georg%20Forster">Georg</a> had already penned the name "Banksia" to describe a different genus of plant, and hence "Banksia" J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered "Banksia" L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all "Banksia" taxa to the new name "Sirmuellera"; thus "B. dentata" became "Sirmuellera dentata" (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by <a href="James%20Britten">James Britten</a> in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name "Isostylis", republishing "B. dentata" as "Isostylis dentata" (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> against future challenges.

Commonly known as the tropical banksia, "B. dentata" is known locally as swamp banksia, and "guibuk" by the indigenous people in <a href="Kakadu%20National%20Park">Kakadu National Park</a>. Its local name in the <a href="Nunggubuyu%20language">Nunggubuyu language</a> of eastern <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a> is "rilirdili". Other names from the same region include "Enindurrkwa" in the <a href="Enindhilyagwa%20language">Enindhilyagwa language</a> of <a href="Groote%20Eylandt">Groote Eylandt</a>, and "gulpu" in the <a href="Dhangu%20language">Rirratjingu language</a> of <a href="Yirrkala%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Yirrkala</a>. <a href="Frederick%20Manson%20Bailey">Frederick Manson Bailey</a> reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford knew it as "kabir".

The current <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> arrangement of the genus "Banksia" is based on botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>'s 1999 monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" book series. In this arrangement, "B. dentata" is placed in "Banksia" subgenus "<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>", because its inflorescences take the form of "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes, section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="carpel">styles</a>, and <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that "B. dentata" displays characteristics which are <a href="Primitive%20%28phylogenetics%29">primitive</a> within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>" on account of their similar inflorescences. In a <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis published in 1994, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> placed it in the newly described subseries "Acclives" along with "<a href="Banksia%20plagiocarpa">B. plagiocarpa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20robur">B. robur</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">B. oblongifolia</a>" within the series "Salicinae". These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to "B. robur" on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of "B. dentata", "B. robur" and "B. oblongifolia" were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the "Salicinae" was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with "B. robur", which he felt was too distinctive.
"B. dentata"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" according to "Flora of Australia" is as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Banksiinae</a>, which then comprised genera "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia dentata" resolves as an early offshoot within the Salicinae. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, "B. dentata" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

Across northern Australia, "Banksia dentata" has been recorded as far west as the <a href="King%20Leopold%20Ranges">King Leopold Ranges</a> in the western <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> through the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and extending south to <a href="Nitmiluk%20National%20Park%23Katherine%20Gorge">Katherine Gorge</a> and into Queensland, where it is found on the <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> to as far south as <a href="Cooktown%2C%20Queensland">Cooktown</a>. Off the coast, it has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the <a href="Wessel%20Islands">Wessel Islands</a>, as well as <a href="Melville%20Island%20%28Australia%29">Melville</a> and <a href="Bathurst%20Island%20%28Northern%20Territory%29">Bathurst Island</a>s. It also extends onto the <a href="Aru%20Islands">Aru Islands</a>, where it is found around <a href="Trangan">Trangan</a>, and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, where it ranges in the south from <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> east to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, and around <a href="Bulolo">Bulolo</a> and <a href="Mount%20Mau">Mount Mau</a>. It is the only "Banksia" species not <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Islands">Torres Strait Islands</a> over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.

"Banksia dentata" generally grows on sandy soils in <a href="savanna">savanna</a> woodland or shrubland, along freshwater swamps, watercourses, floodplains or other seasonally wet areas. It has also been found on rocky outcrops, of <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> or <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, to an elevation of around in Australia, and up to in New Guinea. In New Guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season.

"Banksia dentata" is often found with "<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>" and "<a href="Pandanus">Pandanus</a>" species. On Cape York, it is a dominant component in a low scrub known as "wet desert" due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate. On phosphorus-poor soils, "Banksia dentata" is found with "<a href="Melaleuca%20saligna">Melaleuca saligna</a>" and "<a href="Thryptomene%20oligandra">Thryptomene oligandra</a>". On Melville Island it is a dominant component of Banksia low woodland, forming part of a high canopy with "<a href="Melaleuca%20viridiflora">Melaleuca viridiflora</a>"; the understory is composed of sedges such as "<a href="Fimbristylis">Fimbristylis</a>", "<a href="Sorghum%20intrans">Sorghum intrans</a>", "<a href="Eriachne">Eriachne</a>", "<a href="Germainia%20grandiflora">Germainia grandiflora</a>" and the <a href="Restionaceae">restiad</a> "<a href="Dapsilanthus%20spathaceus">Dapsilanthus spathaceus</a>", as well as suckering shrubs "<a href="Lophostemon%20lactifluus">Lophostemon lactifluus</a>" and "<a href="Syzygium%20eucalyptoides">Syzygium eucalyptoides</a>". This <a href="Plant%20community">community</a> grows in wet areas, with a grey topsoil with high moisture and gravel content but low sand.

"Banksia dentata" responds to bushfire by resprouting from its woody <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> although, unlike other members of the Salicinae, it lacks dormant buds at its base. It was described by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin as resembling an "upturned parsnip". Plant communities where it is found are subject to periodic bushfires, and it can become more dominant if fires occur often.

Salkin had noted that its tropical position might mean that "B. dentata" was a key species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the <a href="leaf%23Epidermis">epidermis</a> in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a>s that are filled with a <a href="Phenols">phenolic</a> compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the <a href="Leaf%23Mesophyll">mesophyll</a>.

Numerous nectar-feeding insects are attracted to the flower spikes, which in turn attract <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, <a href="Zosterops">silvereyes</a> and <a href="sunbird">sunbird</a>s, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The <a href="sugar%20glider">sugar glider</a> ("Petaurus breviceps") forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The <a href="common%20blossom%20bat">common blossom bat</a> ("Syconycteris australis") feeds on nectar. "B. dentata" has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species "<a href="Amyema%20benthamii">Amyema benthamii</a>", "<a href="Decaisnina%20angustata">Decaisnina angustata</a>" and "<a href="Decaisnina%20signata">D. signata</a>".

The tree's gnarled bark, large green leaves, and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features. "B. dentata" is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer. It has not been able to be grown in colder climates, such as those of Canberra. Flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed. Plants can be <a href="Pruning">pruned</a> hard, and do best on a sandy slightly <a href="Soil%20pH">acid soil</a> of <a href="pH">pH</a> 5.5–6.5. They can be vulnerable to <a href="Woodboring%20beetle">borers</a>. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 32 to 40 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. "Banksia dentata" was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1822.

"Banksia dentata" is used as a nectar source in the honey bee industry. Aborigines in the Northern Territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands, these lasting for up to two hours. The nectar was consumed by indigenous people. A hot smoking flower spike was used to cauterise <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a> sores, and people suffering from <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> would squat over smoking cones in the hope this would relieve their symptoms. The thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women, and flower spikes were used as combs.

Banksia grossa

Banksia grossa, commonly known as the coarse banksia, is a species of <a href="shrub">shrub</a> in the <a href="plant">plant</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Southwest%20Australia">Southwest Australia</a>. It is one of fourteen species of <a href="banksia">banksia</a> of the <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">Abietinae</a>", all of which bear predominantly cylindrical or oval <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s. Collected in 1965, it was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> in 1981 by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>. Its thick <a href="leaf">leaves</a> and large <a href="seed">seed</a>s distinguish it from other members of the "Abietinae", and are the basis of its species name.

Found in <a href="sand">sand</a> or sand over <a href="laterite">laterite</a> among <a href="heath">heath</a> between <a href="Eneabba%2C%20Western%20Australia">Eneabba</a> and <a href="Badgingarra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Badgingarra</a> in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, it grows as a many-<a href="plant%20stem">stemmed</a> shrub to high with narrow leaves and oval brownish <a href="flower">flower</a> spikes up to high, composed of hundreds of individual flowers. Flowering occurs throughout the cooler months of March to September. Flower spikes develop woody <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> which bear the seeds. After <a href="wildfire">bushfire</a>, "Banksia grossa" regenerates from its woody <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>; bushfires also stimulate the release of seeds, which <a href="germinate">germinate</a> after <a href="disturbance%20%28ecology%29">disturbance</a>. Visitors to (and likely <a href="pollination">pollinators</a> of) inflorescences include <a href="insect">insect</a>s and a <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>, the <a href="white-tailed%20dunnart">white-tailed dunnart</a>.

"Banksia grossa" grows as a bushy shrub, generally high, or occasionally up to high. Its many stems rise from a woody <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. Young stems have a coating of woolly hairs, while older stems are covered in flaky pale brown bark. Borne on 3 to 5 mm long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>, the somewhat fleshy leaves are needle-like. Although they are between long, and only 2 to 3 mm wide, they are still thicker than those of other members of the <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">Abietinae</a>". The <a href="Leaf%23Edge%20%28margin%29">margins</a> of the leaves are straight with no teeth and rolled over, and the upper surfaces are sparsely hairy when young, but later hairless. New growth occurs over spring and early summer.

Flowers occur in a typical "Banksia" flower spike: an <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> made up of hundreds of small individual flowers, or florets, densely packed around (and completely obscuring) a woody cylindrical axis. In "B. grossa", this axis is high with a diameter of . From this, the florets radiate out laterally, giving the inflorescence a diameter of . Flowers are rusty brown to golden brown, and consist of a hairy long tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> which opens at maturity (<a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>) to release the dark red to purple <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a>. long, the style extends past the perianth and is curved at the tip. The flower spikes arise from short thick branchlets running off larger stems, though some flower spikes are terminal (located at the ends of branches and more prominently displayed in the foliage).

Flowering occurs between March and September, though early flowering in December has been recorded. It takes five to eight weeks for a flower to develop from bud to the end of flowering. About three weeks before the flowers open, they develop a strong musky smell. The opening of flowers occurs sequentially, starting at the bottom of the inflorescence and sweeping through to the top over a period of around two weeks. At anthesis the flowers produce copious quantities of <a href="nectar">nectar</a>; indeed, some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground. After flowering, the old florets wither and curl against the spike, giving it a hairy appearance. Now known as an <a href="infructescence">infructescence</a>, it is roughly ellipsoidal, 6 to 10 cm high (2.2–4 in) and wide. Up to 25 smooth, elliptical <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop on the spike, each containing up to two wide wedge-shaped <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">winged</a> seeds. One field study revealed, on average, eight follicles for each fertile cone. Initially covered in fine fur, these are long, high and jut out by . The fur rubs off and they become smooth with wear, and generally remain closed until opened by fire.

The seeds of "Banksia grossa" are the largest of all the species of the series "Abietinae". Measuring long, they are made up of a cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body, long by wide, and a wide wing. The <a href="seed%20separator">woody separator</a> is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. The bright green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s are <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> and can be either convex or concave, measuring 1.6 to 2.2 cm long by 0.9 to 1.2 cm wide. These arise from a stocky seedling stem, known as the <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a>, which is reddish and covered in short hairs. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricles</a> of the cotyledons are 2 mm long. Seedling leaves arise 0.6 to 0.8 cm beyond the cotyledons and are oppositely arranged. Linear, they are 1.4 to 1.6 cm long with recurved margins and are covered in white hair. The stem remains reddish. Subsequent leaf pairs are successively longer.

The first known specimen collection of "B. grossa" was made by botanist <a href="Fred%20Humphreys">Fred W. Humphreys</a> in 1965. <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> has expressed surprise that it was not collected by earlier visitors to the area, speculating that "perhaps they were diverted by its similarity to "<a href="Banksia%20leptophylla">B. leptophylla</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20sphaerocarpa">B. sphaerocarpa</a>"." George formally described the species in his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", based on a specimen collected by him on the <a href="Brand%20Highway">Brand Highway</a>, 76 km north of <a href="Regans%20Ford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Regans Ford</a>, on 14 May 1969. He placed it in subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its flower spike; section "<a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">Oncostylis</a>" because its styles are hooked; and the resurrected series "Abietinae", which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. It was placed in <a href="phyletic%20order">phyletic order</a> between "<a href="Banksia%20micrantha">B. micrantha</a>" and "B. leptophylla". The specific epithet is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "grossus" ("coarse") and refers to the leaves, flowers and fruit, all of which George observed were more coarse than other members of "B." ser. "Abietinae".

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">an arrangement</a> informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. "Banksia" ser. "Abietinae" was found to be very nearly <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>, and so was retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four <a href="subseries">subseries</a>. "Banksia grossa" appeared as the most basal member of the second of these:

This clade became the basis for the new subseries <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Sphaerocarpae">"Sphaerocarpae"</a>, which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in "B. micrantha"), and "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". The species other than "B. grossa" also have shouldered follicles.

Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. The placement of "B. grossa" was the same as in 1981, except that "<a href="Banksia%20telmatiaea">B. telmatiaea</a>" was moved to set between it and "B. leptophylla". The placement of "B. grossa" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. "Banksia grossa" was inferred to be sister to a <a href="polytomous">polytomous</a> clade consisting of "B. leptophylla", "B. telmatiaea", "B. scabrella" and "B. lanata":

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by merging "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>" into it, and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. grossa" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

"Banksia grossa" mainly occurs from west of <a href="Yandanooka%2C%20Western%20Australia">Yandanooka</a> in the north, south to <a href="Badgingarra%20National%20Park">Badgingarra National Park</a>, and east almost to <a href="Coorow%2C%20Western%20Australia">Coorow</a>. It grows in shallow sand over <a href="laterite">laterite</a>, in deep sand, and occasionally atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>. Around 40% of plants occur on <a href="Road%20verge%23Rural%20roadsides">road verges</a>.

"Banksia grossa" resprouts from its woody lignotuber after bushfire. Shrubs carry relatively low numbers of seeds compared with plant species that regenerate by seed after bushfire. A field study in Eneabba showed shrubs bore anywhere from 30 to 90 seeds per plant. Seeds borne on plants, however, are less likely to be eaten by animals than seed lying dormant in the soil, and hence survive to produce future seedlings. Populations of resprouting plants, like "B. grossa", benefit more from longer intervals between fires as their stored <a href="Soil%20seed%20bank">seedbank</a> takes longer to accumulate than reseeding species. The follicles generally open after bushfire, releasing seeds which <a href="germinate">germinate</a> after <a href="disturbance%20%28ecology%29">disturbance</a>. Species with persistent flowers on old spikes often require higher temperatures for follicles to open after burning; laboratory testing resulted in 50% opening after exposure to 270 °C and 90% after 400 °C.

The leaves of "B. grossa" are adapted to a dry climate. The lower surfaces are protected by the strongly <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23revolute">revolute</a> shape of the leaf, the leaf margins curling around underneath almost to the mid-vein. The <a href="trichome">trichome</a>s (leaf hairs) run along the mid-vein and the margins, further protecting the surface where the <a href="stoma">stoma</a>tes are located, thus minimising water loss. Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series "Abietinae" developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.

The inflorescences are highly attractive to insects. The rare bee species "<a href="Hylaeus%20globuliferus">Hylaeus globuliferus</a>" is a recorded visitor. Large numbers of <a href="Coccinellidae">ladybirds</a> have been reported drinking the nectar of this species, while ignoring nearby "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">Banksia attenuata</a>" inflorescences. The <a href="white-tailed%20dunnart">white-tailed dunnart</a> ("Sminthopsis granulipes") has been observed visiting flower spikes. Pollen has been found on the snouts and in the <a href="feces">scat</a> of several species of <a href="Dasyuridae">dasyurid</a> marsupials, which suggests these animals are likely pollinators of "Banksia" species in general. No pollinators of this species were recorded in "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" survey.

"Banksia grossa" is one of five closely related "Banksia" species that have highly unusual flower nectar. Whereas other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming "an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers". It was first noted by <a href="Byron%20Lamont">Byron Lamont</a> in 1980; he attributed it to <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that feed off the nectar <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had <a href="heterocyst">heterocyst</a>s, he speculated that they aid the plant by <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fixing atmospheric nitrogen</a>, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the <a href="Cluster%20root">proteoid</a> root mat. This purported <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather "a chemical phenomenon of plant origin". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, but three of these species, including "B. sphaerocarpa", have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions. The purpose of coloured nectar is unclear, especially as pollinators such as nocturnal mammals are not thought to forage by sight. However, nectar that becomes more obvious by appearance or smell as it ages might encourage pollinators to prioritise it over newer nectar. It is possible the colour change is unrelated to pollination.

"Banksia grossa" is cultivated for its attractive needle-like leaves and rusty-brown flower spikes, both of which can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or <a href="loam">loam</a>y acidic soils with a <a href="Soil%20pH">pH of 5.5 to 7</a>, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.

<a href="Plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> is by seed. The seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 14 days to germinate. This is a slow-growing plant, taking 5 to 7 years to reach maturity and begin flowering.

Banksia lemanniana

Banksia lemanniana, commonly known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It generally grows as an open shrub or small tree to five metres (15 ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicle</a>s. It occurs within and just east of the <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a> on the southern coast of the state. "Banksia lemanniana" is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.

First described by Swiss botanist <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> in 1856, it was named in honour of English botanist <a href="Charles%20Morgan%20Lemann">Charles Morgan Lemann</a>. It is one of three or four related species all with <a href="pendent">pendent</a> inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. "Banksia lemanniana" is classified as Not Threatened under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia</a>. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", and is one of the easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.

"Banksia lemanniana" grows as an open shrub or, less commonly, a small tree to 5 m (15 ft) in height, with a spreading <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>. The trunk has thin grey bark and can reach a diameter of 15 cm (6 in). Lower-growing plants that reach in height have been reported from coastal areas of <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a>. The new growth is finely hairy and predominantly seen in summer, before losing its hair and becoming glabrous (smooth) over two years. The stiff leaves are narrowly <a href="Leaf%20shape">wedge-shaped</a> or more oval (cuneate to obovate) and measure 3 to 9 cm (1.2–3.6 in) in length by 1.2–3.5 cm (0.5–1.5 in) wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring 0.1 to 0.3 cm each.

Flowering typically occurs between October and January. Unlike those of most other banksias, the cylindrical <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s hang down from branchlets and measure 5–11 cm (2–4.4 in) in length and in diameter. They are green-yellow in colour and smell of honey, and drip large amounts of nectar. The buds are a rich chocolate brown in colour until the yellow flowers push through. The inflorescences turn grey as they age, and the old flowers remain as up to 20 large woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop. Oval in shape, wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair, they can reach 4.5 cm (1.8 in) long, 3 cm (1.2 in) high, and 3 cm (1.2 in) wide.

The obovate seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is dark brown and wrinkled, while the other is black and smooth. Both surfaces sparkle slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Seedlings have cuneate (wedge-shaped) <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s which measure long and wide. These are dull green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and the margin of the wedge may be <a href="Glossary%20of%20plant%20morphology%23crenulate">crenulated</a> (lined with small teeth). The <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is red and measures 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) high and 0.25–0.3 cm (0.1 in) wide.

The first known botanical collection of "B. lemanniana" was made by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> in early 1847, during a voyage of botanical exploration through the <a href="Stirling%20Ranges">Stirling Ranges</a> to <a href="Cape%20Riche">Cape Riche</a>, in company with <a href="George%20Maxwell">George Maxwell</a>. This expedition would result in much of Drummond's renowned "Fourth Collection", including the celebrated "<a href="Hakea%20victoria">Hakea victoria</a>". On returning home, Drummond sent a report of his explorations to "<a href="The%20Inquirer%20%28Perth%29">The Inquirer</a>", which published it on 14 April. In it, Drummond states "On Mount Barren I found... a remarkable nodding yellow-flowered Banksia, with leaves and a habit so like B. Caleyii, that it can only be distinguished by the cones and flowers, which are widely different." This is now recognised as a reference to "B. lemanniana".

The name "Banksia lemanniana" first appeared in print in 1852, being included in "A List of the Proteaceae Collected in South-Western Australia by Mr James Drummond", written by <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> and published in "<a href="Hooker%27s%20Journal%20of%20Botany%20and%20Kew%20Garden%20Miscellany">Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany</a>". Four years later, Meissner published a formal <a href="species%20description">species description</a> in his chapter on the <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> for <a href="A.%20P.%20de%20Candolle">A. P. de Candolle</a>'s "<a href="Prodromus%20Systematis%20Naturalis%20Regni%20Vegetabilis">Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis</a>". Neither of Meissner's publications gives an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is now accepted as honouring the English botanist <a href="Charles%20Morgan%20Lemann">Charles Morgan Lemann</a>. It has sometimes been misspelt "lehmanniana" after being mistakenly attributed to the German botanist <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Christian%20Lehmann">Johann Lehmann</a>. Common names include yellow lantern banksia and Lemann's banksia.

Meissner placed "B.  lemanniana" in <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Quercinae">Quercinae</a>" in <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> characters. "Banksia lemanniana" was placed in section "Orthostylis". In his 1891 work "<a href="Revisio%20Generum%20Plantarum">Revisio Generum Plantarum</a>", German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. lemanniana" as "Sirmuellera lemanniana". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a>.

In his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> placed "B.  lemanniana" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike; in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="Gynoecium">style</a>s. He made it the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Tetragonae">"B." ser. "Tetragonae"</a>, the members of which are defined by their pendulous inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered it closely related to "<a href="Banksia%20aculeata">B. aculeata</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20caleyi">B. caleyi</a>", which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences.

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published the results of a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of "Banksia". They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's "B." ser. "Tetragonae" was found to be <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of "B. lemanniana" as <a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> to the pair of species "B. aculeata" and "B. caleyi".
"B. lemanniana"s placement in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George, and was discarded in his 1999 revision.
Under <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a>, "B. aculeata"s placement was as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of the three species in a <a href="clade">clade</a> corresponding closely with "B." ser. "Tetragonae".

Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B.  lemanniana" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia lemanniana" is found near the southern coast of Western Australia, most of its population protected within Fitzgerald River National Park. Outside the park, it reaches the Ravensthorpe Range to the northeast and the <a href="rabbit-proof%20fence">rabbit-proof fence</a> to the east, as well as isolated populations westwards as far as <a href="Beaufort%20Inlet">Pallinup estuary</a>. The annual rainfall is . It is found on the tops and slopes of hills as well as flatter areas on rocky or <a href="laterite">lateritic</a> soil, as well as sand, in <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee scrubland</a> or <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a>. "Banksia lemanniana" is relatively secure as much of its range lies within a National Park, and it is not a species collected for the cut flower industry. It is hence classified as Not Threatened under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia</a>.

A variety of <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s have been recorded visiting the flower spikes, including <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.

"Banksia lemanniana" is killed by <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> and regenerates from seed. It is unclear how quickly seedlings take to reach flowering in the wild, but cultivated records suggest around five or six years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.

"Banksia lemanniana" has been shown to have a low to moderate susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with "P. cinnamomi" and "<a href="Phytophthora%20citricola">P. citricola</a>" found "B. lemanniana" to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.

One of the easier Western species to grow, "Banksia lemanniana" has some horticultural potential in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes five to six years to flower from seed. It prefers a more <a href="Soil%20pH">alkaline</a> rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal <a href="pH">pH</a> range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>.

Banksia marginata

Banksia marginata, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a species of tree or woody shrub in the plant <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" found throughout much of southeastern Australia. It ranges from the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, to north of <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale, New South Wales</a>, and across <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and the islands of <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>. It grows in various habitats, including "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" forest, <a href="Shrubland">scrub</a>, <a href="heath">heath</a>land and <a href="moorland">moorland</a>. "Banksia marginata" varies widely in <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>, ranging from a small shrub, high, to a large tree, tall. The narrow leaves are <a href="leaf%20shape">linear</a> and the yellow <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s (flower spikes) occur from late summer to early winter. The flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> bearing the winged seeds. Originally described by <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> in 1800, further collections of "B. marginata" were described as several separate species by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1810. However, all were reclassified as a single species by <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> in 1870. No distinct <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been recognised by "Banksia" expert <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>, who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed.

Many species of bird, in particular <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> varies. Some populations are <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>: they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the <a href="Canopy%20seed%20bank">plant canopy</a> and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>s or <a href="Basal%20shoot">suckers</a> from lateral roots. Although it has been used for <a href="timber">timber</a>, "Banksia marginata" is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with <a href="Dwarfing">dwarf</a> forms being commercially <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagated</a> and sold.

"Banksia marginata" is a highly variable species, usually ranging from a small shrub around a metre (3 ft) tall to a tree. Unusually large trees of 15 to possibly 30 m (50–100 ft) have been reported near <a href="Beeac%2C%20Victoria">Beeac</a> in Victoria's <a href="Western%20District%20%28Victoria%29">Western District</a> as well as several locations in Tasmania, while compact shrubs limited to high have been recorded on coastal <a href="heath">heath</a>land in Tasmania (such as at <a href="Rocky%20Cape%20National%20Park">Rocky Cape National Park</a>). Shrubs reach only high in <a href="Gibraltar%20Range%20National%20Park">Gibraltar Range National Park</a>. The bark is pale grey and initially smooth before becoming finely <a href="wikt%3Atessellated">tessellated</a> with age. The new branchlets are hairy at first but lose their hairs as they mature, the new growth a pale or pinkish brown. The leaves are alternately arranged on the stems on 2–5 mm long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>, and characteristically toothed in juvenile or younger leaves ( long). The narrow adult leaves are dull green in colour and generally linear, oblong or wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure long and wide. The margins become entire with age, and the tip is most commonly <a href="wikt%3Atruncate">truncate</a> or <a href="wikt%3Aemarginate">emarginate</a>, but can be acute or <a href="wikt%3Amucronate">mucronate</a>. The cellular makeup of the leaves shows evidence of <a href="wikt%3Alignification">lignification</a>, and the leaves themselves are somewhat stiff. Leaves also have sunken <a href="stoma">stoma</a>tes. The leaf undersurface is white with a prominent <a href="wikt%3Amidrib">midrib</a> covered in brownish hairs.

The complex flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appear generally from late summer to early winter (February to June) in New South Wales and Victoria, although flowering occurs in late autumn and winter in the Gibraltar Range. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, perpendicularly from which a large number of compact floral units arise, which measure tall and wide. Pale yellow in colour, they are composed of up to 1000 individual flowers (784 recorded in the Gibraltar Range) and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old. Sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in the same flowering season. They can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud. As with most banksias, <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a> is <a href="wikt%3Aacropetal">acropetal</a>; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. Over time the flower spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the old flowers generally persist on the cone. The woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> grow in the six months after flowering, with up to 150 developing on a single flower spike. In many populations, only a few follicles develop. Small and elliptic, they measure long, high, and wide. In coastal and floodplain populations, these usually open spontaneously and release seed, while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats. Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is egg- to wedge-shaped (<a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> to <a href="wikt%3Acuneate">cuneate</a>) and composed of a dark brown wide membranous "wing" and wedge- or sickle-shaped (cuneate–<a href="wikt%3Afalcate">falcate</a>) seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often <a href="wikt%3Aglisten">glistens</a>. The resulting seedling first grows two obovate <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a> leaves, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. The cotyledons of "Banksia marginata", "<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B. paludosa</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>" are very similar in appearance.

"Banksia marginata" is commonly called the silver banksia, because the white undersides of its leaves contrast with the otherwise green foliage and give the plant a "silvery" look. Alternate common names include honeysuckle and dwarf honeysuckle. The aboriginal name in the <a href="Jardwadjali">Jardwadjali</a> language of western Victoria was "warock", while the <a href="Kaurna%20language">Kaurna</a> name from the <a href="Adelaide%20Plains">Adelaide Plains</a> was "pitpauwe" and the <a href="Tasmanian%20languages">local name</a> in the <a href="Macquarie%20Harbour">Macquarie Harbour</a> region in Tasmania was "tangan".

A widely distributed and diverse plant, "B. marginata" was described independently and given many different names by early explorers. On his <a href="Third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">third voyage</a>, Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> reported a "most common tree..about ten feet high, branching pretty much, with narrow leaves, and a large yellow cylindrical flower, consisting only of a vast number of filaments; which, being shed, leave a fruit like a pine top." in January 1777. The species was first collected by <a href="Luis%20N%C3%A9e">Luis Née</a> in 1793, from somewhere between <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Parramatta%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Parramatta</a>. In 1800, the Spanish botanist <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> gave the species the binomial name it still bears today. The species name is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "marginatus" ("bordered") and refers to appearance of the lower surface of the recurved margins of the leaves when viewed from underneath. Cavanilles also described another specimen collected by Née in the same locality as a different species, "Banksia microstachya" Cav. A smaller shrub with <a href="wikt%3Adentate">dentate</a> leaves, this turned out to be an immature plant of the same species with juvenile leaves.

<a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> described 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", including six taxa ("B. marginata" α and β plus four further species) now attributable to "B. marginata". He split the genus into two subgenera, placing these species in subgenus "Banksia verae", the "True Banksias". He described "Banksia australis" R.Br., giving the location of the collection as <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip Bay</a> in Victoria in 1802 (having crossed out <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a> 1804). Brown's other collections which were reduced to synonymy with "B. marginata" were "Banksia depressa" R.Br., a prostrate shrub from <a href="Margate%20Rivulet">Margate Rivulet</a> in southeastern Tasmania, "Banksia insularis" R.Br., from <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders</a> and <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a>, and "Banksia patula" R.Br., a shrub from the vicinity of <a href="Port%20Lincoln%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Lincoln, South Australia</a>. The French naturalist <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Bonpland">Aimé Bonpland</a> in 1816 called it "Banksia marcescens" Bonpl., deemed an "<a href="illegitimate%20name">illegitimate name</a>", as by that time the name "Banksia marginata" already had been published. Still more synonyms are "Banksia ferrea" Vent. ex Spreng. and "Banksia gunnii" Meisn.
By the time <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into "B. marginata" in series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>.

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define "B. australis", "B. depressa", "B. patula", and "B. insularis" were unable to distinguish separate <a href="Form%20%28botany%29">forms</a> as more specimens came to light, and hence declared them synonyms of "B. marginata". Meissner's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> characters. "B. marginata" was placed in section "Eubanksia" along with "B. integrifolia" and "<a href="Banksia%20dentata">B. dentata</a>".

The current <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> arrangement of the genus "Banksia" is based on botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>'s 1999 monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" book series. In this arrangement, "B. marginata" is placed in "Banksia" <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>", because its inflorescences take the form of "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes, <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="carpel">styles</a>, and <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> cladistic analysis published in 1994, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries "Integrifoliae", within the series "Salicinae". However, this subgrouping of the "Salicinae" was not supported by George. George did concede that major work is needed on "Banksia marginata", which shows such a high degree of variability over its range.
"B. marginata"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Banksiinae</a>, which then comprised genera "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia marginata" resolves as the closest relative, or "sister", to "B. saxicola", the two <a href="Taxon">taxa</a> part of a larger group containing "B. paludosa" and the three subspecies of "B. integrifolia". Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. marginata" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

<a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybridisation</a> with <a href="Banksia%20conferta%20subsp.%20penicillata">"Banksia conferta" subsp. "penicillata"</a> at the site of an old abandoned railway between <a href="Newnes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newnes</a> and <a href="Clarence%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Clarence</a> in the Blue Mountains has been recorded; a single "B. marginata" plant was surrounded by plants with intermediate features but more strongly resembling "B. conferta" subsp. "penicillata". "B. marginata" can also interbreed with "B. paludosa" where they are found together. A hybrid with "<a href="Banksia%20saxicola">B. saxicola</a>" was recorded from <a href="Mount%20William%20%28Mount%20Duwil%29">Mount William</a> during the "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">Banksia Atlas</a>" project.

A purported hybrid with "B. integrifolia", thought to be from <a href="Cape%20Paterson%2C%20Victoria">Cape Paterson</a> on Victoria's south coast, was first described by Alf Salkin and is commercially available in small quantities. It forms an attractive hardy low-growing plant to . Salkin observed an intermediate form which occurred in coastal areas where "Banksia marginata" and "B. integrifolia" are found together. Calling it the "Wilsons Promontory topodeme", he noted that it colonised sand dunes, had leaves similar to but narrower than "integrifolia", and had persisting flowers on old spikes but not as persistent as "marginata". He had collected this form from <a href="Revesby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Revesby</a> in New South Wales as well as Cape Paterson, and had received reports of similar plants at Marlo and <a href="Bemm%20River">Bemm River</a>s. Stands of plants intermediate between "B. integrifolia" and "B. marginata" have been recorded near <a href="Mallacoota">Mallacoota</a> in <a href="East%20Gippsland">East Gippsland</a>.

"Banksia marginata" is found from <a href="Baradine">Baradine</a> and <a href="Gibraltar%20Range%20National%20Park">Gibraltar Range National Park</a> in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, southwards into <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, as well as across <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. It is found on the major islands of <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>, including King, Flinders and <a href="Cape%20Barren%20Island">Cape Barren Island</a>s. There is one report of a collection from the Springbrook Mountains southwest of Southport in southeastern Queensland. It is extremely rare in southwestern New South Wales. In Victoria, it is predominantly coastal or near-coastal east of <a href="Traralgon">Traralgon</a>, but in New South Wales it is absent from coastal areas in the Sydney region. "Banksia marginata" often grew as a large tree on the basalt plains west of Melbourne, but has almost disappeared. In the vicinity of Adelaide, it was common in the western suburbs on old sand dunes behind the beach foredunes. It remains common in the Adelaide foothills. The annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from .

In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a dominant shrub of open heathland and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges. Plants here have some degree of self-compatibility. In the Sydney region, it grows in association with heath banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">Banksia ericifolia</a>"), old man banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20serrata">B. serrata</a>"), mountain devil ("<a href="Lambertia%20formosa">Lambertia formosa</a>"), lance-leaved geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20lanceolata">Persoonia lanceolata</a>") and dwarf apple ("<a href="Angophora%20hispida">Angophora hispida</a>") in heathland, and with silvertop ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">Eucalyptus sieberi</a>"), Blue Mountains ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20oreades">E. oreades</a>"), Sydney peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20piperita">E. piperita</a>"), scribbly gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20haemastoma">E. haemastoma</a>"), Blue Mountains mallee ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20stricta">E. stricta</a>"), brittle gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20mannifera">E. mannifera</a>"), snow gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pauciflora">E. pauciflora</a>") and red bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">Corymbia gummifera</a>") in forested areas.

It is widespread as an <a href="understory">understory</a> species in medium rainfall <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forests across Victoria, occurring in association with manna gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20viminalis">Eucalyptus viminalis</a>"), narrow-leaf peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20radiata">E. radiata</a>"), messmate ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">E. obliqua</a>"), swamp gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20ovata">E. ovata</a>") and brown stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20baxteri">E. baxteri</a>"). It is a common shrub, sometimes small tree, in <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heathy</a> and shrubby forests as well as coastal <a href="Shrubland">scrub</a> and heath in part of its range. In <a href="South%20Gippsland">South Gippsland</a>, it is generally a shrub which regenerates from a lignotuber or suckers after bushfire and sets few seed. It has been recorded as a low spreading shrub in <a href="Croajingolong%20National%20Park">Croajingolong National Park</a> in East Gippsland. In the <a href="Wombat%20State%20Forest">Wombat State Forest</a> west of Melbourne, it grows as a high shrub on less fertile soils, and as a large tree to on more fertile soils. Few trees remain, having been cleared for agriculture or for fuel. Similarly, further west in the <a href="Corangamite%20Catchment%20Management%20Authority">Corangamite</a> region, it is either a tree or suckering shrub.

In Tasmania, "Banksia marginata" occupies a wide range of habitats, in mixed forest (where it grows as a small tree), <a href="Gymnoschoenus%20sphaerocephalus">button grass</a> moorlands, flood plains of the Loddon, <a href="Franklin%20River">Franklin</a> and <a href="Huon%20River">Huon River</a>s, as well as coastal regions. In parts of the west and southwest of Tasmania, the species is dominant within the threatened native vegetation community known as "Banksia marginata" wet scrub. There is no macrofossil record for the species, so it is unclear whether it is a recent introduction from the mainland or has only recently evolved, although its presence on both the mainland and Tasmania suggests it has been present since the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. It grows in coastal habitats that would be occupied by "Banksia integrifolia" on the mainland.

"Banksia marginata" grows on a variety of soil types, from clay <a href="loam">loam</a>s, <a href="shale">shale</a> and <a href="peat">peat</a>y loams to sandy or rocky soils composed of <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a>, <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a> or <a href="granite">granite</a>, although sandier soils predominate. It is restricted to sandy soils in the Adelaide region. The soil types are of a wide range of <a href="pH">pH</a>, from highly <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soils</a> in the <a href="Grampians%20National%20Park">Grampians</a> to alkaline soils in South Australia. Plants have been recorded at altitudes ranging from sea level to as high as <a href="Australian%20Height%20Datum">AHD</a> at <a href="Mount%20Field%20National%20Park">Mount Field National Park</a>.

Numerous species of birds have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers; these include <a href="rainbow%20lorikeet">rainbow lorikeet</a> "(Trichoglossus haematodus"), <a href="musk%20lorikeet">musk lorikeet</a> ("Glossopsitta concinna"), <a href="purple-crowned%20lorikeet">purple-crowned lorikeet</a> ("G. porphyrocephala"), <a href="double-eyed%20fig-parrot">double-eyed fig-parrot</a> ("<a href="Cyclopsitta%20diophthalma">Cyclopsitta diophthalma</a>"), <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="little%20wattlebird">little wattlebird</a> ("A. chrysoptera"), <a href="yellow%20wattlebird">yellow wattlebird</a> ("A. paradoxa"), <a href="spiny-cheeked%20honeyeater">spiny-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("Acanthagenys rufogularis"), <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus chrysops"), <a href="singing%20honeyeater">singing honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus virescens"), <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed honeyeater</a> ("L. penicillatus"), <a href="black-chinned%20honeyeater">black-chinned honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus gularis"), <a href="brown-headed%20honeyeater">brown-headed honeyeater</a> ("M. brevirostris"), <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped honeyeater</a> ("M. lunatus"), <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("P. novaehollandiae"), <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops"), <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris"), <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a> ("Manorina melanocephala"), <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis") and <a href="Acanthiza">thornbill</a>s ("Acanthiza" species). In addition, the <a href="yellow-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">yellow-tailed black cockatoo</a> ("Calyptorhynchus funereus") feeds on the seed.

The <a href="agile%20antechinus">agile antechinus</a> ("Antechinus agilis"), <a href="bush%20rat">bush rat</a> ("Rattus fuscipes"), <a href="feathertail%20glider">feathertail glider</a> ("Acrobates pygmaeus"), and <a href="sugar%20glider">sugar glider</a> ("Petaurus breviceps") have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Both pollen and nectar are consumed by the <a href="southwestern%20pygmy%20possum">southwestern pygmy possum</a> ("Cercarteus concinnus"). Ants, bees (both native and European honeybees), blowflies and brown butterflies have been recorded as visitors to flower spikes. The wasp "<a href="Mesostoa%20kerri">Mesostoa kerri</a>" of the subfamily <a href="Mesostoinae">Mesostoinae</a> within the family <a href="Braconidae">Braconidae</a> causes stem galls on "B. marginata" in southeastern South Australia. The galls are either round to a diameter of , or cigar-shaped to . Their effect on the plant is unclear. "B. marginata" is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the buprestid beetle "<a href="Cyrioides%20imperialis">Cyrioides imperialis</a>". Much more pathological is the banksia longicorn beetle ("<a href="Paroplites%20australis">Paroplites australis</a>") which bores holes in the base of banksia plants which then weaken and fall or blow over with wind and die. Several species of fungus have been recorded growing on the foliage, including "<a href="Acrospermum%20gaubae">Acrospermum gaubae</a>", "<a href="Argopericonia%20elegans">Argopericonia elegans</a>", "<a href="Asterina%20systema-solare">Asterina systema-solare</a>", "<a href="Botryosphaeria%20banksiae">Botryosphaeria banksiae</a>", a species of "<a href="Cladosporium">Cladosporium</a>", "<a href="Cooksonomyces%20banksiae">Cooksonomyces banksiae</a>", "<a href="Dimerium%20banksiae">Dimerium banksiae</a>", "<a href="Episphaerella%20banksiae">Episphaerella banksiae</a>", a "<a href="Periconiella">Periconiella</a>" species, "<a href="Satchmopsis%20australiensis">Satchmopsis australiensis</a>", "<a href="Tryssglobulus%20aspergilloides">Tryssglobulus aspergilloides</a>", and a species of "<a href="Veronaea">Veronaea</a>".

All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>). The root system of the <a href="Basal%20shoot">suckering</a> forms of "Banksia marginata" in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root, and an extensive system of thick lateral roots below the surface. During the winter months, segments around in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers. Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to long arise from these lateral roots.
The response of "Banksia marginata" to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed. They are <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>, storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best. In <a href="Little%20Desert%20National%20Park">Little Desert National Park</a> in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia, it grows as a low shrub which suckers (shoots growing from lateral roots) after fire. Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent. A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of "Banksia marginata" plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region. Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; "Banksia marginata" tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it.

Tasmanian forms have been shown to be frost tolerant at any time of year, which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.

A trial in Western Australia showed "Banksia marginata" to be mildly sensitive to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback. At <a href="Brisbane%20Ranges%20National%20Park">Brisbane Ranges National Park</a> west of Melbourne, which was invaded by "Phytophthora cinnamomi" in the 1970s, "Banksia marginata" (along with such species as "<a href="Grevillea%20steiglitziana">Grevillea steiglitziana</a>") was part of a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.

The plant was often used by many indigenous clans and tribes throughout the east coast and used in similar fashion as a large amount as others banksia trees.

The sweet nectar from the flowers was sucked or drained by soaking in water and in some cases mixed with some wattle gum in order to make a sweet lolly

The woods was also used to make needles and the dried flowers were used to strain water for drinking

The red-hued heartwood is coarse-grained and soft. It is sometimes used for <a href="wood%20turning">turning</a>, but requires careful <a href="Wood%20drying">drying</a> before use to avoid warping. A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 as part of a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a>. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281889%29">Exposition Universelle</a> in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the <a href="Melbourne%20Museum">Melbourne Museum</a>.

"Banksia marginata" was first introduced into cultivation in England in 1802 (and was also listed as "B. australis", "B. insularis" and "B. marcescens"); it was grown at <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew</a>, <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Botanic%20Garden">Cambridge Botanic Gardens</a>, <a href="Woburn%20Abbey">Woburn Abbey</a> and private gardens in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Harringay%20%281750%E2%80%931880%29%23Harringay%20House">Haringay House</a>. One specimen grown in a glasshouse at Kew was described as a tree high with a trunk girth of two feet (60 cm) at 40 years of age.

"B. marginata" is generally fairly easy to grow in a well-drained sunny or part-shaded position in the garden. It can be leggy in shadier positions, or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun. Some varieties from drier areas seem to do poorly in areas of summer humidity. The flowers are not prominent unless they are numerous. Established plants can withstand drought, coastal exposure and temperatures as low as . <a href="Plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> of plants can be by seed or <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a>; the latter is essential if trying to replicate plants of particular habit (such as dwarf specimens). Some "Banksia marginata" seed of subalpine provenance require <a href="Stratification%20%28botany%29">stratification</a>, namely keeping at for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days. Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring. "Banksia saxicola" and "Banksia canei" seed also share this trait.

Some dwarf forms have been commercially available in Australian nurseries, although some selections do not maintain their dwarf status in cultivation. "Banksia" 'Mini Marg' is a small form selected from the northeastern coast of Tasmania which reaches high and wide. 'Mallacoota Dwarf' was selected from a natural population at <a href="Mallacoota%2C%20Victoria">Mallacoota, Victoria</a>. Alf Salkin reported a form from <a href="Kanangra-Boyd%20National%20Park">Kanangra Walls</a> with a peach-tinged limb as having horticultural potential, as well as a <a href="Prostrate%20shrub">prostrate</a> form from <a href="Cape%20Liptrap">Cape Liptrap</a> in Victoria. "Banksia marginata", and the dwarf <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> 'Mini Marg', have also been used in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>.

Banksia oblongifolia

Banksia oblongifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved, dwarf or rusty banksia, is a species in the plant <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>". Found along the eastern coast of Australia from <a href="Wollongong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wollongong, New South Wales</a> in the south to <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton, Queensland</a> in the north, it generally grows in sandy soils in <a href="heath">heath</a>, open forest or swamp margins and wet areas. A many-stemmed <a href="shrub">shrub</a> up to high, it has leathery serrated leaves and rusty-coloured new growth. The yellow flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, most commonly appear in autumn and early winter. Up to 80 <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, or seed pods, develop on the spikes after flowering. "Banksia oblongifolia" resprouts from its woody <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s, and the seed pods open and release seed when burnt, the seed <a href="germinating">germinating</a> and growing on burnt ground. Some plants grow between fires from seed shed spontaneously.

Spanish botanist <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> <a href="species%20description">described</a> "B. oblongifolia" in 1800, though it was known as "Banksia aspleniifolia" in New South Wales for many years. However, the latter name, originally coined by <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Anthony Salisbury</a>, proved <a href="valid%20name%20%28botany%29">invalid</a>, and "Banksia oblongifolia" has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. Two <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> were recognised in 1987, but these have not been generally accepted. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences. Though easily grown as a garden plant, it is not commonly seen in <a href="horticulture">horticulture</a>.

"Banksia oblongifolia" is a shrub that can reach high, though is generally less than high, with several stems growing out of a woody base known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. The smooth bark is marked with horizontal <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s, and is reddish-brown fading to greyish-brown with age. New leaves and branchlets are covered with a rusty fur. The leaves lose their fur and become smooth with maturity, and are <a href="phyllotaxis">alternately arranged</a> along the stem. Measuring in length and in width, the leathery green leaves are oblong to <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) or <a href="leaf%20shape">truncate</a> with a recessed midvein and mildly recurved <a href="Leaf%23Edge%20.28margin.29">margins</a>, which are entire at the base and serrate towards the ends of the leaves. The <a href="Sinus%20%28botany%29">sinuses</a> (spaces between the teeth) are U-shaped and teeth are 1–2 mm long. The leaf underside is whitish with a reticulated vein pattern and a raised central <a href="wikt%3Amidrib">midrib</a>. The leaves sit on 2–5 mm long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>s.

Flowering has been recorded between January and October, with a peak in autumn and early winter (April to June). The <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, or flower spikes, arise from the end of 1 to 5 year old branchlets, and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from the node or base. Measuring high and wide, the yellow spikes often have blue-grey tinged limbs in bud, though occasionally pinkish, mauve or mauve-blue limbs are seen. Opening to a pale yellow after <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, the spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to high and wide, with up to 80 <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. Covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age, the oval-shaped follicles measure long by 0.2–0.7 cm high (0.1–0.3 in) and wide. The bare swollen spike, now known as an infructescence, is patterned with short spiky persistent <a href="bract">bract</a>s on its surface where follicles have not developed. Each follicle contains one or two obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwiching a <a href="Seed%20separator">woody separator</a>. Measuring long, they are made up of an oblong to semi-elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s long and wide, which sit on a stalk, or 1 mm diameter finely hairy seedling stem, known as the <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a>, which is less than 1 cm high. The first seedling leaves to emerge are paired (oppositely arranged) and <a href="wikt%3Alanceolate">lanceolate</a> with fine-toothed margins, measuring 2.5–3 cm long and 0.4–0.5 cm wide. Subsequent leaves are more <a href="wikt%3Aoblanceolate">oblanceolate</a>, elliptic (oval-shaped) or <a href="wikt%3Alinear">linear</a>. Young plants develop a lignotuber in their first year.

"Banksia oblongifolia" can be distinguished from "<a href="Banksia%20robur">B. robur</a>", which it often co-occurs with, by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes. "B. robur" has more metallic green flower spikes, and often grows in wetter areas within the same region. "<a href="Banksia%20plagiocarpa">B. plagiocarpa</a>" has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated margins, and its flower spikes are blue-grey in bud, and later bear wedge-shaped follicles. In the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>, "<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B. paludosa</a>" also bears a superficial resemblance to "B. oblongifolia", but its leaves are more prominently <a href="wikt%3Aspatulate">spathulate</a> (spoon-shaped) and tend to point up rather than down. The leaf undersides are white and lack the prominent midrib of "B. oblongifolia", the new growth is bare and lacks the rusty fur, and the aged flower parts remain on the old spikes.

First collected by <a href="Luis%20N%C3%A9e">Luis Née</a> between March and April 1793, the fern-leaved banksia was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> in 1800 as two separate species from two collections, first as "Banksia oblongifolia" from the vicinity of <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> (Sydney), and then as "Banksia salicifolia" from around <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a>. Derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "oblongus" "oblong", and "folium" "leaf", the species name refers to the shape of the leaves. <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Anthony Salisbury</a> had published the name "Banksia aspleniifolia" in 1796 based on leaves of cultivated material.

<a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> recorded 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", and used the epithet "oblongifolia" in his <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a>, placing the taxon in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. He recognised "B. salicifolia" as the same species at this point, but was unsure whether Salisbury's "B. aspleniifolia" belonged under the same name. By the time <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He followed Brown in using the name "B. oblongifolia", and placed it in the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a>.

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. He declared "B. oblongifolia" referrable to, and a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> of, "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>". Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> characters. "B. integrifolia" was placed in section "Eubanksia".

Botanists in the 20th century recognised "B. oblongifolia" as a species in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used "Banksia oblongifolia", while New South Wales authorities used "Banksia aspleniifolia" as it was the oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that "oblongifolia" was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of "<a href="Banksia%20paludosa">B. paludosa</a>", "B. integrifolia" or even "<a href="Banksia%20marginata">B. marginata</a>".

The current <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> arrangement of the genus "Banksia" is based on botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>'s 1999 monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" book series. In this arrangement, "B. oblongifolia" is placed in "Banksia" <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>", because its inflorescences take the form of "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes, <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its straight <a href="carpel">styles</a>, and <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Salicinae"</a> because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> cladistic analysis published in 1994, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> placed it in the newly described subseries "Acclives" along with "<a href="Banksia%20plagiocarpa">B. plagiocarpa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20robur">B. robur</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20dentata">B. dentata</a>" within the series "Salicinae". However, this subgrouping of the "Salicinae" was not supported by George.
"B. oblongifolia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Banksiinae</a>, which then comprised genera "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia oblongifolia" resolves as the closest relative, or "<a href="sister%20group">sister</a>", to "B. robur", with "B. plagiocarpa" as next closest relative. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, "B. oblongifolia" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

George noted that "Banksia oblongifolia" showed considerable variation in habit, and in 1987 Conran and Clifford separated the taxon into two subspecies. In examining populations in southern Queensland, they reported that the two forms were distinct in growth <a href="habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a> and habitat, and that they did not find any intermediate forms. New South Wales botanists <a href="Joseph%20Maiden">Joseph Maiden</a> and <a href="Julius%20Henry%20Camfield">Julius Henry Camfield</a> had collected this taller form of "B. oblongifolia" in <a href="Kogarah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kogarah</a> in 1898, and given it the name "Banksia latifolia" <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "minor"—"B. latifolia" being a published name by which "B. robur" was known—before Maiden and <a href="Ernst%20Betche">Ernst Betche</a> renamed it "Banksia robur" variety "minor". This name (confusingly) thus became the name for the taller variety. They defined variety "oblongifolia" as a multistemmed shrub high, with leaves long and wide, and flower spikes high. The habitat is swamps and swamp borders, or rarely sandstone ridges. Variety "minor" is a taller shrub high with leaves up to long and spikes high. It is an <a href="understory">understory</a> plant in <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests, associated with "<a href="Eucalyptus%20signata">Eucalyptus signata</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20spinulosa">Banksia spinulosa</a>" var. "collina". Both subspecies occur throughout the range. However, George rejected the varieties, stating the variability was continuous.

"Banksia robur" and "B. oblongifolia" <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> have been recorded at several locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and <a href="Pialba%2C%20Queensland">Pialba</a> in central Queensland. Locales include <a href="Calga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Calga</a> north of Sydney, <a href="Ku-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park">Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</a>, and <a href="Upper%20Nepean%20Scheme%23Cordeaux%20Dam">Cordeaux Dam</a> near Wollongong. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between the two near <a href="Darkes%20Forest%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darkes Forest</a> on the <a href="Woronora%20Plateau">Woronora Plateau</a> south of Sydney revealed extensive hybridization in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridization. Furthermore, there were a few plants with morphology suggestive of a third species, "B. paludosa", in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. A possible hybrid between "B. oblongifolia" and "B. integrifolia" was recorded near <a href="Caloundra">Caloundra</a> by "Banksia Atlas" volunteers.

"Banksia oblongifolia" occurs along the eastern coast of Australia from <a href="Wollongong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wollongong, New South Wales</a> in the south to <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton, Queensland</a> in the north. There are isolated populations offshore on <a href="Fraser%20Island">Fraser Island</a>, and inland at <a href="Blackdown%20Tableland%20National%20Park">Blackdown Tableland National Park</a> and <a href="Crows%20Nest%2C%20Queensland">Crows Nest</a> in Queensland, and also inland incursions at the base of the <a href="Glasshouse%20Mountains">Glasshouse Mountains</a> in southern Queensland, at <a href="Grafton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Grafton</a> in northern New South Wales, and <a href="Bilpin%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bilpin</a> and <a href="Lawson%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lawson</a> in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a> west of Sydney."B. oblongifolia" grows in a range of habitats—in damp areas with poor drainage, along the edges of swamps and flats, as well as <a href="wallum">wallum</a> shrubland, or coastal plateaux. It is also found in open forest or <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, where it grows on ridges or slopes, or <a href="heath">heath</a>. Soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone-based, though granite-based and clay-<a href="loam">loam</a>s are sometimes present.

Associated species in the Sydney region include heathland species such as heath banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">Banksia ericifolia</a>"), coral heath ("<a href="Epacris%20microphylla">Epacris microphylla</a>") and mountain devil ("<a href="Lambertia%20formosa">Lambertia formosa</a>"), and tick bush ("<a href="Kunzea%20ambigua">Kunzea ambigua</a>") and prickly-leaved paperbark ("<a href="Melaleuca%20nodosa">Melaleuca nodosa</a>") in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">Eucalyptus sclerophylla</a>") and narrow-leaved apple ("<a href="Angophora%20bakeri">Angophora bakeri</a>") in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an "Endangered Ecological Community". Here "B. oblongifolia" is an <a href="understory">understory</a> plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20serrata">B. serrata</a>") as <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> trees, and wallum banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20aemula">B. aemula</a>"), variable smoke-bush ("<a href="Conospermum%20taxifolium">Conospermum taxifolium</a>"), wedding bush ("<a href="Ricinocarpos%20pinifolius">Ricinocarpos pinifolius</a>"), showy parrot-pea ("<a href="Dillwynia%20sericea">Dillwynia sericea</a>") and nodding geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20nutans">Persoonia nutans</a>") as other understory species.

"Banksia oblongifolia" plants can live for more than 60 years. They respond to <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the greatest number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in <a href="Ku-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park">Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</a> found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are <a href="Serotiny">serotinous</a>, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial <a href="Canopy%20seed%20bank">seed bank</a> in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not <a href="Seed%20dispersal">disperse</a> far from the parent plant.

Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="Lewin%27s%20honeyeater">Lewin's honeyeater</a> ("Meliphaga lewinii"), <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops"), <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus chrysops"), <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed honeyeater</a> ("L. penicillatus"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris niger"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("P. novaehollandiae"), <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a> ("Philemon corniculatus"), <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a> ("Manorina melanocephala") and <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris"). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the <a href="western%20honey%20bee">European honey bee</a> and ants. The swamp wallaby ("<a href="Wallabia%20bicolor">Wallabia bicolor</a>") eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire.

One field study found 30% of seeds were eaten by insects between bushfires. Insects recovered from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth ("<a href="Arotrophora%20arcuatalis">Arotrophora arcuatalis</a>"), younger <a href="instar">instar</a>s of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the woody axis of the spike as they get older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genera "<a href="Cryptophasa">Cryptophasa</a>" and "<a href="Xylorycta">Xylorycta</a>", as well as "<a href="Scieropepla%20rimata">Scieropepla rimata</a>", "<a href="Chalarotona%20intabescens">Chalarotona intabescens</a>" and "<a href="Chalarotona%20melipnoa">Chalarotona melipnoa</a>" and an unidentified <a href="weevil">weevil</a> species.

Like most other <a href="proteaceae">proteaceae</a>, "B. oblongifolia" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s—roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter.

A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the <a href="Myall%20Lakes">Myall Lakes</a> found "B. oblongifolia" on slopes (wet heath) and "B. aemula" grew on ridges (dry heath), and the two species did not overlap. Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that "B. oblongifolia" can grow longer roots seeking water than other wet heath species and that seedlings can establish in dry heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in dry heath as well as wet heath. Unlike similar situations with "Banksia" species in Western Australia, the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other.

<a href="Loddiges">Conrad Loddiges</a> and his sons wrote of "Banksia oblongifolia" in volume 3 of their work "The Botanical Cabinet" in 1818, reporting it had been brought into cultivation in 1792, though had been initially and incorrectly called "Banksia dentata". It flowered in November in the United Kingdom, and was grown in a greenhouse over winter.

Not commonly cultivated, it adapts readily to garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, and timing of flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking five to seven years to flower from seed. <a href="Pruning">Pruning</a> can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a> subject.

Banksia speciosa

Banksia speciosa, commonly known as the showy banksia, is a species of large shrub or small tree in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. It occurs on the south coast of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> between <a href="Hopetoun%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hopetoun</a> (33°57′ S) and the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a> (approximately 33° S 130° E), growing on white or grey sand in <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>. Reaching up to in height, it is a single-stemmed plant that has thin leaves with prominent triangular "teeth" along each margin, which are long and wide. The prominent cream-yellow flower spikes known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s appear throughout the year. As they age they develop up to 20 <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> each that store seeds until opened by fire. "Banksia speciosa". Though widely occurring, it is highly sensitive to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a> and large populations of plants have succumbed to the disease.

Collected and described by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in the early 19th century, "Banksia speciosa" is classified in the <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">Banksia</a>" within the genus. Its closest relative is "<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">B. baxteri</a>". "Banksia speciosa" plants are killed by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, and a variety of insects. In cultivation, "Banksia speciosa" grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been <a href="Grafting">grafted</a> onto "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">Banksia serrata</a>" or "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>".

"Banksia speciosa" grows as a shrub or small tree anywhere from 1 to 6 or rarely 8 m (4–26 ft) high. It has an open many-branched <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>, arising from a single stem or trunk with smooth grey bark. Unlike many banksias, it does not have a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. The plant puts on new growth, which is covered in rusty-coloured fur, in summer. The long thin leaves are linear, 20–45 cm (8–18 in) long and 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) wide. They are bordered with 20 to 42 prominent triangular lobes that have a zigzag pattern. The lobes are long and wide, while the V-shaped <a href="Sinus%20%28botany%29">sinuses</a> between intrude almost to the <a href="wikt%3Amidrib">midrib</a> of the leaf. The <a href="Leaf%23Margins%20%28edge%29">leaf margins</a> are slightly <a href="wikt%3Arecurved">recurved</a>. On the underside of each lobe, there are 3–10 <a href="Leaf%23Veins">nerves</a> converging on the lobe apex. The midrib is raised on the leaf undersurface; it is covered with white hair when new but brownish hair when mature.

The cream to yellow flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, can appear at any time of year. They arise on the ends of one- or two-year-old stems and are roughly cylindrical in shape with a domed apex, measuring high and wide at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. Each is a compound flowering structure, with a large number of individual flowers arising out of a central woody axis. A field study on the southern <a href="sandplain">sandplain</a>s revealed an average count of 1369±79 on each spike. The <a href="perianth">perianth</a> is grey-cream in bud, maturing to a more yellow or cream. The <a href="Gynoecium">style</a> is cream and the tip of the <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen-presenter</a> maroon. Ageing spikes are grey, with old flowers remaining on them, and develop up to 20 large red <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> each. Roughly oval and jutting out prominently from the spike, each follicle is long by wide and high and is covered in dense fur, red-brown initially before aging to grey. It remains closed until opened by bushfire, and contains one or two viable seeds.

The seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey and the other is dark brown; on this side the seed body protrudes and is covered with tiny filaments. The seeds are separated by a dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. It measures long and wide. The dull green <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s of seedlings are wider than they are long, measuring 1.4–1.5 cm (0.6 in) across and 1.2–1.3 cm (0.5 in) long, described by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> as "broadly <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a>". Each cotyledon has a <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at its base and has three faint nerve-like markings on its lower half. The <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a> is smooth and red. The seedling leaves emerge in an opposite arrangement and are deeply serrated into three triangular lobes on each side. The seedling stem is covered in white hair.

A variant from the <a href="Gibson%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gibson</a> area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, "Banksia speciosa" shows little variation across its range. Combined with its vigour and prominence in its habitat, this has led George to speculate that it is a recent development among its relatives.

"<a href="Banksia%20baxteri">Banksia baxteri</a>" resembles "B. speciosa" and co-occurs with it at the western edge of its range, but has shorter, wider leaves with larger lobes, shorter flower spikes and is a smaller, more open shrub.

The first botanical collection of this species may well have been <a href="Claude%20Riche">Claude Riche</a>, <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> to <a href="Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux">Bruni d'Entrecasteaux</a>'s 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Galaup%2C%20comte%20de%20La%20P%C3%A9rouse">Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse</a>. During a visit to <a href="Esperance%20Bay">Esperance Bay</a>, Riche explored an area in which "B. speciosa" is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at <a href="Lucky%20Bay">Lucky Bay</a> to be the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> in 1981. An early <a href="common%20name">common name</a> was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.

Robert Brown recorded 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", and in his <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a>, placed the taxon in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Banksia%20verae">Banksia verae</a>", the "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike. By the time <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1856 arrangement</a> of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a> in 1847, into four <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> based on leaf properties. He placed "B. speciosa" in the series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandroideae">"Dryandroideae"</a>.

<a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Bentham's arrangement</a>, the number of recognised "Banksia" species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> and pollen-presenter characters. "Banksia speciosa" was placed in section "Orthostylis".

In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged the generic name "Banksia" <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">L.f.</a>, on the grounds that the name "Banksia" had previously been published in 1775 as "Banksia" <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">J.R.Forst</a> & <a href="Georg%20Forster">G.Forst</a>, referring to the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an alternative, republishing "B. speciosa" as "Sirmuellera speciosa". The challenge failed, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a>.

Alex George published a new <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomic arrangement</a> of "Banksia" in his classic 1981 monograph <a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">"The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)"</a>. Endlicher's "Eubanksia" became <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, and was divided into three sections. "B. speciosa" was placed in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." sect. "Banksia"</a>, and this was further divided into nine series, with "B. speciosa" placed in <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Banksia">"B." ser. "Banksia"</a>.
He thought its closest relative was clearly "Banksia baxteri" based on their similar appearance, noting the two overlapped in their distribution.

<a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis yielded a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> significantly different from George's arrangement. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement</a> retained "B. speciosa" in series "Banksia", placing it in <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Cratistylis">"B." subser. "Cratistylis"</a> along with "B. baxteri" as its <a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> taxon and seven other Western Australian species. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series. "B. speciosa"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" according to "Flora of Australia" is as follows:

In 2002, a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> again showed "Banksia speciosa" and "B. baxteri" to be each other's closest relatives, but they were only distantly related to other members of the series "Banksia". Instead, their next closest relative turned out to be the distinctive "<a href="Banksia%20coccinea">Banksia coccinea</a>".

Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia" in 2005. They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subg. "Banksia". They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> of "Dryandra" was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. speciosa" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

"Banksia speciosa" occurs on coastal dunes and sandplains in the <a href="Esperance%20Plains">Esperance Plains</a> and <a href="Mallee%20%28biogeographic%20region%29">Mallee</a> <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> regions on the south coast of Western Australia, from East Mount Barren in the <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a> and the vicinity of <a href="Hopetoun%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hopetoun</a> eastwards to <a href="Israelite%20Bay">Israelite Bay</a>, generally within 50 km (31 mi) of the coast. The range extends inland to Mount Ragged and 25 km (16 mi) southwest of <a href="Grass%20Patch%2C%20Western%20Australia">Grass Patch</a>. There is an outlying population to the east at <a href="Point%20Culver">Point Culver</a> on the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a>.

"Banksia speciosa" grows on flat or gently sloping ground on deep white or grey sand. It is often the dominant shrub in shrubland, commonly found with such species as "<a href="Lambertia%20inermis">Lambertia inermis</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20pulchella">Banksia pulchella</a>", and "<a href="Banksia%20petiolaris">B. petiolaris</a>".

The prominent flower spikes are visited by many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a>, as well as the <a href="fuscous%20honeyeater">fuscous honeyeater</a>, <a href="western%20wattlebird">western wattlebird</a> and <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a>. Other birds recorded foraging include the <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey butcherbird</a> and species of <a href="Acanthiza">thornbill</a>. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles. The <a href="short-billed%20black%20cockatoo">short-billed black cockatoo</a> breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.

"Banksia speciosa" is <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>, that is, it has an <a href="Canopy%20seed%20bank">aerial seed bank</a> in its <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> in the form of the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which germinate and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed "B. speciosa" seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring "Banksia" species. Though this suggested "B. speciosa" might outcompete its <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>s, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.

"Banksia speciosa" is extremely sensitive to dieback caused by "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" and numbers in <a href="Cape%20Le%20Grand%20National%20Park">Cape Le Grand</a> and <a href="Cape%20Arid%20National%20Park">Cape Arid National Park</a>s have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an <a href="indicator%20species">indicator species</a> for the presence of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen "Phytophthora" taxon "niederhauserii".

The tiny <a href="ascomycota">sac fungus</a> "<a href="Phyllachora%20banksiae">Phyllachora banksiae</a>" subspecies "westraliensis" has been described from the leaves of "B. speciosa", its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1–3 mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25–0.75 by 0.25–1 mm appear in the centre of the spots.

A fast-growing and attractive plant, "Banksia speciosa" grows readily in a sunny location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been <a href="Grafting">grafted</a> successfully onto "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">Banksia serrata</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>" to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Garden%20Edinburgh">Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh</a> in 1830. "Banksia speciosa" is an important <a href="cut%20flower">cut flower</a> crop. It was one of several species considered for commercial cropping in <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately <a href="halotolerance">tolerant to salinity</a>.

Banksia sphaerocarpa

Banksia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the fox banksia or round-fruit banksia, is a species of <a href="shrub">shrub</a> or tree in the plant genus "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" (family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>). It is generally encountered as a high shrub, and is usually smaller in the north of its range. This species has narrow green leaves, and brownish, orange or yellow round flower <a href="raceme">spikes</a> which may be seen from January to July. It is widely distributed across the <a href="Southwest%20Botanical%20Province">southwest</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, growing exclusively in sandy soils. It is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. It is pollinated by, and is a food source for, birds, mammals, and insects.

First described in 1810 by botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>, "B. sphaerocarpa" has a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, and several <a href="Taxon">taxa</a> once classified as part of a broadly defined "B. sphaerocarpa" have since been named as species in their own right. At present, most authorities recognise five <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a>; the largest variety, <a href="Banksia%20sphaerocarpa%20var.%20dolichostyla">"B. sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla"</a> (ironcap banksia), is sometimes given species rank as "B. dolichostyla". "B. sphaerocarpa" is classified as Not Threatened under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia</a>, although two varieties have been placed on the <a href="Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List">Declared Rare and Priority Flora List</a>—var. "latifolia " has been designated a Priority Two – Poorly Known taxon, and var. "dolichostyla" falls under Declared Rare Flora. None of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation.

"Banksia sphaerocarpa" is a variable <a href="species">species</a> that differs in <a href="plant">plant</a> size, <a href="flower">flower</a> size and <a href="leaf">leaf</a> size across its range. The variability is marked enough that five <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> are recognised. This species is generally a shrub tall. Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range, and grow larger in the southeast, with var. "dolichostyla" and rarely var. "caesia" reaching in height. All varieties bear a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, a swollen starchy <a href="root%20crown">root crown</a> from which the plant resprouts after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>. The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity. The leaves are stiff, narrow and linear, and measure in length, on a petiole long. Leaves of most varieties are in width, and have a pointed tip, but var. "latifolia" has wider leaves, , and a blunter tip. The foliage is green, or a more pale blue-grey in the case of "caesia" and "dolichostyla".
The <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s are generally globular and measure in diameter, although larger forms, such as var. "dolichostyla", are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour. They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. Anthesis takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence. Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground. The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike. Up to 60 <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring long, high, and wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section. Specimens of var. "sphaerocarpa" in the <a href="Whicher%20Range">Whicher Range</a>, <a href="Jarrah%20Forest">Jarrah Forest</a> and the vicinity of <a href="Nannup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Nannup</a> have larger follicles. The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring long by wide.

Northern specimens can be quite small shrubs and may be hard to distinguish from "<a href="Banksia%20micrantha">B. micrantha</a>", which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles.

The earliest known botanical collection of "B. sphaerocarpa" occurred in December 1801, during the visit of <a href="HMS%20Investigator">HMS "Investigator"</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>. The specimen was collected from "A single plant observed between <a href="Princess%20Royal%20Harbour">Princess Royal Harbour</a> & <a href="Oyster%20Harbour">Oyster Harbour</a> on a heath", and is credited to English botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>, though it is not possible to be certain on this point, as Brown incorporated the collections of junior expedition members into his herbarium without attribution. Neither Brown nor expedition horticulturist <a href="Peter%20Good">Peter Good</a> mentions the collection in his diary.

Brown published a formal description and name for the species in his 1810 "<a href="On%20the%20Proteaceae%20of%20Jussieu">On the Proteaceae of Jussieu</a>". He did not designate a <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> (a specimen to be representative of the species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> for the species. He also did not state the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a>, but it is accepted that the name derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "sphaera-" ("round"), and "carpos" ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.

In <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Brown's arrangement of the genus</a>, "B. sphaerocarpa" was placed between "<a href="Banksia%20pulchella">B. pulchella</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20nutans">B. nutans</a>" in <a href="taxonomic%20sequence">taxonomic sequence</a>; that is, an order that places related taxa next to each other. No subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> of its own. Swiss botanist <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">a more detailed arrangement</a> in 1856, placing "B. sphaerocarpa" in <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Eubanksia">"Eubanksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed <a href="Head%20%28botany%29">head</a>, and in <a href="Series%20%28botany%29">series</a> <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">"Abietinae"</a>, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations. Meissner also published a variety, "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "glabrescens", based on specimens collected by <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a>; this is now considered a synonym of "<a href="Banksia%20incana">B. incana</a>".

<a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a>'s <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">revision of "Banksia"</a> for his 1870 "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" overturned Meissner's series; instead, "B. sphaerocarpa" was placed in a new section, "<a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">Oncostylis</a>", because of its hooked <a href="pistil">styles</a>. Two varieties were recognised: Meissner's var. "glabrescens" was retained, and var. "latifolia" was newly described by Bentham. Bentham noted further variation amongst his specimens not accounted for by his varieties, stating "It is possible therefore that two species may be here confounded, but the specimens are insufficient for their distinction."

For many years following Bentham's arrangement, the circumscription of "B. sphaerocarpa" was widely recognised as unacceptably broad. <a href="William%20Blackall">William Blackall</a> informally published two varieties, var. "pinifolia" and var. "violacea" (properly "<a href="Banksia%20violacea">Banksia violacea</a>") in his 1954 "<a href="How%20to%20Know%20Western%20Australian%20Wildflowers">How to Know Western Australian Wildflowers</a>"; and in 1966 the nurseryman <a href="Fred%20Lullfitz">Fred Lullfitz</a> predicted that there were as many as eight taxa within the species. Several of these were recognised in George's revision of the genus for 1981 "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>": "<a href="Banksia%20micrantha">B. micrantha</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20grossa">B. grossa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20lanata">B. lanata</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20scabrella">B. scabrella</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20telmatiaea">B. telmatiaea</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20leptophylla">B. leptophylla</a>" and "B. incana". George placed "B. sphaerocarpa" in subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because of its flower spike, section "Oncostylis" because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series "Abietinae", which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He reduced variety "latifolia" to <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymy</a> with variety "sphaerocarpa", but conceded the species needed further review. Alex George reported that he thought "Banksia sphaerocarpa"'s closest relatives to be "<a href="Banksia%20micrantha">Banksia micrantha</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20grossa">B. grossa</a>".

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published an <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arrangement</a> informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. "Banksia" ser. "Abietinae" was found to be very nearly <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four <a href="subseries">subseries</a>. "Banksia sphaerocarpa" appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' "grossa" clade' for its most <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> member. As with George's classification, "B. grossa" and "B. micrantha" emerged as close relatives of "B. sphaerocarpa".

This clade became the basis for new subseries <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Sphaerocarpae">"Sphaerocarpae"</a>, which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in "micrantha"), and "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". Other than the most basal "B. grossa", these species also have shouldered follicles. Having found "B. micrantha" to be more closely related than "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla" to the other varieties of "B. sphaerocarpa", they promoted var. "dolichostyla" to species rank as "Banksia dolichostyla". Morphological support for this was given by the fact that the old styles of var. "dolichostyla" are quite different from those of other varieties, being stouter, and tending not to curl around the infructescence as the others do.

Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. He added that he did not feel the characters of "dolichostyla" alone justified specific rank, being essentially merely larger in all parts than, but otherwise essentially similar to, var. "caesia". Therefore, he retained it as a variety of "B. sphaerocarpa". To date, George's 1999 arrangement remains the most recent comprehensive classification. The placement of "B. sphaerocarpa" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

A 2002 study by American botanists <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and Tom Givnish yielded a surprise when molecular analysis mapped out "dolichostyla" as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour "B. violacea", in a clade with "B. laricina" and "B. incana". "B. micrantha" and the other two varieties of "B. sphaerocarpa" form a separate clade nearby.

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by merging "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>" into it, and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. sphaerocarpa" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

In 2008, George reinstated "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "latifolia", and published the new variety "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "pumilio".

"Banksia sphaerocarpa" is a widely distributed Western Australian species with four (or five if one includes var. "dolichostyla") varieties:

"Banksia sphaerocarpa" is distributed widely across southwestern Western Australia—from <a href="Eneabba%2C%20Western%20Australia">Eneabba</a> in the north, south to the <a href="Whicher%20Range">Whicher Range</a>, Nannup, <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> and <a href="Jerramungup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Jerramungup</a>, and eastwards to the vicinity of <a href="Hyden%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hyden</a>. It is mainly found on sandy soils in flat or gently sloped areas in <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee</a> or open woodland.

As a species, "B. sphaerocarpa" is not considered to be under threat, but two of the five varieties have been placed on the <a href="Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List">Declared Rare and Priority Flora List</a>. "B sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla" has been gazetted as "Declared Rare Flora – Extant" under the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</a>. "Banksia sphaerocarpa" var. "latifolia", though not afforded legislative protection, has been identified as a "Priority Two – Poorly Known" taxon, because so few populations are known.

Various animals, including mammals, birds, and insects such as bees, wasps, ants and beetles, have been recorded visiting "Banksia sphaerocarpa" inflorescences, including the <a href="colletidae">colletid</a> bee species "<a href="Hylaeus%20sanguinipictus">Hylaeus sanguinipictus</a>". Botanist <a href="Stephen%20Hopper">Stephen Hopper</a> found pollen of "B. sphaerocarpa" on <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a>s ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae") and <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a>s ("Tarsipes rostratus") at Cheyne Beach in a <a href="field%20study">field study</a> published in 1980.

Knowledge of the <a href="breeding%20system">breeding system</a> of "B. sphaerocarpa" comes from a 2009 study of <a href="genetic%20structure">genetic structure</a> within and across <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmented</a> plant populations, which made a <a href="case%20study">case study</a> of "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "caesia" populations in the vicinity of <a href="Dongolocking%2C%20Western%20Australia">Dongolocking</a>, where the landscape has been severely fragmented by <a href="land%20clearing">land clearing</a>. Very little <a href="self-pollination">self-pollination</a> was observed. Most mating was between plants in the same population, but inter-population mating accounted for 15–33% of seed, a "very significant contribution... to overall reproductive dynamics". This figure was lowest in the smallest populations, which also exhibited lower rates of germination, smaller plants, and less genetic diversity than larger populations. One possible interpretation of this is that interpopulation mating confers a fitness advantage. There was also evidence of fine-scale genetic structure, with plants tending to be more closely related to nearby plants than to more distant plants. The authors suggest that gene flow was probably always limited in these populations, even before they were fragmented.

"Banksia sphaerocarpa" is one of five closely related "Banksia" species that have highly unusual flower <a href="nectar">nectar</a>. Whereas other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming "an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he attributed it to <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that feed off the nectar <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had <a href="heterocyst">heterocyst</a>s, he speculated that they aid the plant by <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fixing atmospheric nitrogen</a>, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the <a href="Cluster%20root">proteoid</a> root mat. This purported <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather "a chemical phenomenon of plant origin". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, but three of these species, including "B. sphaerocarpa", have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions.

Like most Western Australian "Banksia" species, "B. sphaerocarpa" is susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>". In one experiment, 43% of plants were dead within three months of inoculation, and the species was therefore rated as "moderately susceptible". In another experiment, 37% of plants were dead within three months, and 85% within a year; yet this study rated the species' susceptibility as "high". In the latter study, it took 35 to 40 days for the death rate to reach its maximum, and thereafter the death rate continued at that level throughout the year, only dipping slightly in the dry summer months.

None of the varieties of "Banksia sphaerocarpa" are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult to grow in the wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with <a href="grafting">grafting</a> have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to <a href="sowing">sowing</a>, and take 20 to 48 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>.

Banksia telmatiaea

Banksia telmatiaea, commonly known as swamp fox <a href="banksia">banksia</a> or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub that grows in marshes and swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as an upright bush up to tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in "<a href="Banksia%20sphaerocarpa">B. sphaerocarpa</a>" (fox banksia).

The shrub grows amongst <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> in seasonally wet lowland areas of the coastal sandplain between <a href="Badgingarra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Badgingarra</a> and <a href="Serpentine%2C%20Western%20Australia">Serpentine</a> in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. A little studied species, not much is known of its <a href="ecology">ecology</a> or <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation biology</a>. Reports suggest that it is pollinated by a variety of birds and small mammals. Like many members of series "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">"Abietinae"</a>", it has not been considered to have much horticultural potential and is rarely cultivated.

"B. telmatiaea" grows as an upright bush up to 2 m (7 ft) high. It has hairy stems and branchlets, and straight, narrow leaves from 1½ to 3 centimetres (½–1 inches) long and about a millimetre ( in) wide. The leaves have a green upper surface and white hairy undersurface. The new growth is pale brown, later turning green.
Flowers occur in "flower spikes", <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s made up of hundreds of flower pairs densely packed around a woody axis. Arising from short lateral branchlets off stems older than four years of age, the inflorescence of "B. telmatiaea" is roughly oval to cylindrical, with a height of 3–5 cm (1–2 in) and diameter of 4–7 cm (1–2 in). It contains between 500 and 900 golden brown to pale brown flowers, each of which consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four fused <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. The species generally flowers from April to August, although flowers have been observed as late as November. They take five to six weeks to develop from bud, then reach anthesis over a period of two weeks. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of <a href="nectar">nectar</a>; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.

The fruiting structure is a stout woody "cone", with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. Up to 70 woody <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, each of which contains a single seed, may be embedded in the cone. As with other "Banksia" species, only a small proportion of flowers go on to form follicles; in the case of "B. telmatiaea", the proportion is around 4% for those "cones" that set some fruit. About 80% of fruiting structures set no fruit at all. According to <a href="John%20K.%20Scott">John K. Scott</a>, "there [is] no obvious reason on the basis of morphology of pollination for this lack of seed set".

"B. telmatiaea" was first collected around 1840 by <a href="Ludwig%20Preiss">Ludwig Preiss</a> and <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a>. For many years it was included in "B. sphaerocarpa", but by 1980 it was recognised as a distinct species. In recognition of its distinctness from, yet affinity with, "B. sphaerocarpa", it was for a time informally referred to as "Banksia" aff. "Sphaerocarpa". It was eventually published by <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> in his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", based on a specimen collected by him on the <a href="Brand%20Highway">Brand Highway</a> about 45 kilometres (28 miles) north of <a href="Regans%20Ford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Regans Ford</a> on 14 May 1969, and labelled "A.S. George 9309". He found it most closely resembled "B. leptophylla", but regarded its preference for swampy rather than sandy soils and winter flowering as worthy of warranting species status. George gave it the specific name "telmatiaea" from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> <a href="word%20stem">stem</a> "telmat-"/τελματ- ("the mud of a pond"), in reference to its swampy habitat. Thus the full name for the species is "Banksia telmatiaea" A.S.George. Common names for "B. telmatiaea" include swamp fox banksia and marsh banksia.

George placed "B. telmatiaea" in subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike, section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">"Oncostylis"</a> because it has hooked styles, and series <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Abietinae">"Abietinae"</a> because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be "<a href="Banksia%20leptophylla">B. leptophylla</a>" (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from "B. telmatiaea" in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between "<a href="Banksia%20scabrella">B. scabrella</a>" (Burma Road Banksia) and "<a href="Banksia%20laricina">B. laricina</a>" (Rose-fruited Banksia).

In 1996, <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published the results of a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of "Banksia". They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. "B." ser. "Abietinae" was found to be very nearly <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a>, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four <a href="subseries">subseries</a>. "B. telmatiaea" appeared in the third of these:

This clade became the basis of <a href="Banksia%20subser.%20Leptophyllae">"B." subser. "Leptophyllae"</a>, which Thiele defined as containing those species with "indurated and spinescent common bracts on the infructescence axes, and densely arachnose seedling stems." In accordance with their cladogram, their arrangement placed "B. telmatiaea" next to "B. scabrella".

Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1999 arrangement</a>. "B." ser. "Abietinae" was restored to George's 1981 circumscription, and all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries were abandoned. "B. telmatiaea" was moved in the <a href="phyletic%20order">phyletic order</a> to between "<a href="Banksia%20grossa">B. grossa</a>" (Coarse Banksia) and "B. leptophylla", thus better according with the affinity with "B. leptophylla" claimed by George in 1981.

The placement of "B. telmatiaea" in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. With respect to "B. telmatiaea", Mast's results accord closely with Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, inferring a <a href="polytomous">polytomous</a> clade consisting of "B. leptophylla", "B. telmatiaea", "B. scabrella" and "B. lanata", with "<a href="Banksia%20grossa">B. grossa</a>" (Coarse Banksia) as the nearest <a href="Outgroup%20%28cladistics%29">outgroup</a>:

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by merging "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>" into it, and publishing <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. telmatiaea" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

"B. telmatiaea" grows only in the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>, <a href="Geraldton%20Sandplains">Geraldton Sandplains</a> and <a href="Jarrah%20Forest">Jarrah Forest</a> <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> regions, inland from the coast but never east of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a>. It occurs from <a href="Hill%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Hill River</a> near <a href="Badgingarra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Badgingarra</a> in the north, to <a href="Serpentine%2C%20Western%20Australia">Serpentine</a> in the south. Most populations occur north of <a href="Moore%20River">Moore River</a> or south of <a href="Cannington%2C%20Western%20Australia">Cannington</a>, there being only a few scattered populations in between.

The species favours lowland areas that are seasonally wet but never inundated, such as the margins of <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s and <a href="marshes">marshes</a>. For example, in the <a href="Yule%20Brook%20Botany%20Reserve">Yule Brook Botany Reserve</a>, where parallel sand <a href="ridge">ridge</a>s cross a clay flat, "B. telmatiaea" occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor on the tops of the ridges, where the drainage is good; but it is one of the most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.

Favoured soils are deep grey sandy loams or shallower sand overlying <a href="claypan">claypan</a>. Associated vegetation is typically <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> or <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, although moisture-loving trees such as "<a href="Banksia%20littoralis">B. littoralis</a>" (swamp banksia) or "<a href="Melaleuca%20preissiana">Melaleuca preissiana</a>" (moonah) may also be present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open <a href="woodland">woodland</a>.

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. telmatiaea" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>.

Unlike many "Banksia" species, "B. telmatiaea" lacks a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, so plants are killed by bushfire. It is adapted to release its <a href="aerial%20seed%20bank">aerial seed bank</a> following a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as <a href="serotiny">serotiny</a>, makes "B. telmatiaea" dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency may be one reason why "B. telmatiaea" does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest Australia</a>. Unlike most serotinous "Banksia" species, the seeds of "B. telmatiaea" are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a>. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.

Four species of bird have been observed visiting the flowers of "B. telmatiaea": the <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae") and the <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"). The introduced European honeybee ("<a href="Apis%20mellifera">Apis mellifera</a>") is also commonly observed, and visits by <a href="ant">ant</a>s and "<a href="Hylaeus%20%28genus%29">Hylaeus</a>" plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by <a href="nectarivore">nectarivorous</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their <a href="feces">scats</a> have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other "Banksia" species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the "B. telmatiaea" spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed in the morning and evening respectively, as opposed to <a href="insect">insect</a>s, which are most active during the day.

Reproductive success is strongly affected by insects that infest the flower spikes and fruiting structures. Infestation of the flower spikes is not as severe as in other "Banksia" species: one study found less than 10% of "B. telmatiaea" inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">B. attenuata</a>" (candlestick banksia), "B. littoralis" and "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>" (Menzies' banksia), and over 90% for "<a href="Banksia%20grandis">B. grandis</a>" (bull banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of "B. telmatiaea" was attacked only by the <a href="tortrix">tortrix</a> <a href="moth">moth</a> "<a href="Arotrophora%20arcuatalis">Arotrophora arcuatalis</a>" (banksia boring moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of spikes with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus "<a href="Xylorycta">Xylorycta</a>". These larvae burrow from follicle to follicle to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested spikes.

"B. telmatiaea" is one of five "Banksia" species, all closely related to "B. sphaerocarpa", that have highly unusual flower <a href="nectar">nectar</a>. Whereas other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion. In the case of "B. telmatiaea", it eventually becomes "an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers". This unusual nectar was first noted in 1980 by <a href="Byron%20Lamont">Byron Lamont</a>, who attributed its transformation to the <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that he observed feeding off the nectar <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had <a href="heterocyst">heterocyst</a>s, he speculated that they aid the plant by <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fixing atmospheric nitrogen</a>, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the proteoid root mat. This purported <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> was investigated in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigations in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather "a chemical phenomenon of plant origin". As of February 2007, the cause was still unknown. Chemical analysis of "B. telmatiaea" nectar has shown it to have a normal nectar sugar composition, albeit dominated by <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a>.

"B. telmatiaea" is a fairly secure species, as most populations are of more than 100 plants, and 26% of known plants are in conservation reserves. Its proximity to <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> suggests that land clearing for urban development could pose a threat, and in 1988 "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" recommended that "the species should continue to be monitored since land clearing could change the situation greatly, particularly amongst its northern populations." It is also known to be susceptible to dieback caused by the <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> plant <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", a soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> that causes root rot; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is used as an indicator species for the presence of the disease. An assessment of the potential impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to <a href="extinction">extinction</a>; but under less severe change scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas.

In 1987, George applied the Rare or Threatened Australian Plants (<a href="ROTAP">ROTAP</a>) criteria to the species, determining it to have a conservation status of "3R": a rare species found only in small populations, but not considered endangered or vulnerable. Western Australia's <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Parks and Wildlife</a> do not consider it to be rare, and have not included it on their <a href="Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List">Declared Rare and Priority Flora List</a>.

"B. telmatiaea" is rarely cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush where they are usually obscured by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it may be reluctant to flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>.

Banksia sessilis

Banksia sessilis, commonly known as parrot bush, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="shrub">shrub</a> or <a href="tree">tree</a> in the <a href="plant">plant</a> <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. It had been known as Dryandra sessilis until 2007, when the genus "<a href="Dryandra">Dryandra</a>" was sunk into "Banksia". The <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> peoples know the plant as Budjan or Butyak. Widespread throughout <a href="southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, it is found on sandy soils over <a href="laterite">laterite</a> or <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, often as an <a href="understory">understorey</a> plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow <a href="Head%20%28botany%29">flowerheads</a>. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food—both the nectar and the insects it attracts—for <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s in the cooler months, and <a href="Biodiversity">species diversity</a> is reduced in areas where there is little or no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the <a href="European%20honey%20bee">European honey bee</a> seek out and consume the nectar, while the <a href="long-billed%20black%20cockatoo">long-billed black cockatoo</a> and <a href="Australian%20ringneck">Australian ringneck</a> eat the seed. The life cycle of "Banksia sessilis" is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets.

"Banksia sessilis" has a somewhat complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history. It was collected from <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in 1801 and described by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1810 as "Dryandra floribunda", a name by which it was known for many years. However, <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28gardener%29">Joseph Knight</a> had published the name "Josephia sessilis" in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent <a href="Horticulture">horticultural</a> potential, and none of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, "B. sessilis" is valuable to the <a href="beekeeping">beekeeping</a> industry.

"Banksia sessilis" grows as an upright shrub or small tree up to high, without a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. In most varieties, new stems are covered in soft, fine hairs that are lost with maturity; but new stems of <a href="Banksia%20sessilis%20var.%20flabellifolia">"B. sessilis" var. "flabellifolia"</a> are usually hairless. Leaves are blue-green or dark green. Their shape differs by variety: in <a href="Banksia%20sessilis%20var.%20cygnorum">var. "cygnorum"</a> and var. "flabellifolia" they are wedge-shaped, with teeth only near the apex; in <a href="Banksia%20sessilis%20var.%20cordata">var. "cordata"</a> they are wedge-shaped, but with teeth along the entire margin; and in <a href="Banksia%20sessilis%20var.%20sessilis">var. "sessilis"</a> they are somewhat broader at the base, sometimes almost oblong in shape. Leaf size ranges from in length, and in width. They may be sessile (that is, growing directly from the stem without a <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>) or on a petiole up to long.

The <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s are cream or yellow, and occur in domed <a href="Head%20%28botany%29">heads</a> wide, situated at the end of a stem. Each head contains from 55 to 125 individual flowers, surrounded at the base by a whorl of short <a href="involucral%20bract">involucral bract</a>s. As with most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, individual flowers consist of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. In "B. sessilis" the perianth is straight, long, and pale yellow. The style is slightly shorter, also straight, and cream-coloured. Thus in "B. sessilis", unlike many other "Banksia" species, the release of the style at anthesis does not result in a showy flower colour change. One field study found that anthesis took place over four days, with the outer flowers opening first and moving inwards.

Flowering mostly takes place from July to November, although var. "sessilis" can start as early as May. After flowering, the flower parts wither and fall away, and up to four follicles develop in the receptable (the base of the flower head). Young follicles are covered in a fine fur, but this is lost as they mature. Mature follicles are <a href="ovoid">ovoid</a> in shape, and measure in length. Most follicles open as soon as they are ripe, revealing their contents: a woody <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> and up to two winged seeds.

Specimens of "B. sessilis" were first collected by Scottish surgeon <a href="Archibald%20Menzies">Archibald Menzies</a> during the visit of the <a href="Vancouver%20Expedition">Vancouver Expedition</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in September and October 1791. No firm location or collection date can be ascribed to Menzies' specimens, as their labels simply read "New Holland, King Georges Sound, Mr. Arch. Menzies", and Menzies' journal indicates that he collected over a wide area, visiting a different location every day from 29 September to 8 October. In addition to "B. sessilis", Menzies collected plant material of "<a href="Banksia%20pellaeifolia">B. pellaeifolia</a>", and seeds of at least four more "Banksia" species. This was therefore an important early collection for the genus, only seven species of which had previously been collected.

Menzies' seed specimens were sent to <a href="England">England</a> from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1793, but his plant material remained with him for the duration of the voyage, during which some material was lost. On his return to England in 1795, the surviving specimens were deposited into the <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> of <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a>, where they lay undescribed for many years.

The next collection was made in December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by <a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29">HMS "Investigator"</a> under the command of <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a>. On board were <a href="botanist">botanist</a> <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>, <a href="botanical%20artist">botanical artist</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a>, and gardener <a href="Peter%20Good">Peter Good</a>. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection, including specimens of "B. sessilis", although neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species. Good also made a separate seed collection, which included "B. sessilis", and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae, Bauer's original field sketch of "B. sessilis" was destroyed in a <a href="Hofburg%20fire">Hofburg fire</a> in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>.

On returning to England in 1805, Brown began preparing an account of his Australian plant specimens. In September 1808, with Brown's account still far from finished, Swedish botanist <a href="Jonas%20Dryander">Jonas Dryander</a> asked him to prepare a separate paper on the <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, so that he could use the genera erected by Brown in a new edition of "<a href="Hortus%20Kewensis">Hortus Kewensis</a>". Brown immediately began a study of the Proteaceae, and in January 1809 he read to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on the family entitled "<a href="On%20the%20Proteaceae%20of%20Jussieu">On the Proteaceae of Jussieu</a>". Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named "Josephia" in honour of Banks.

Brown's paper was approved for printing in May 1809, but did not appear in print until March the following year. In the meantime, <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28gardener%29">Joseph Knight</a> published "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", which appeared to draw heavily on Brown's unpublished material, without permission, and in most cases without attribution. It contained the first publication of Brown's "Josephia", for which two species were listed. The first, "Josephia sessilis", was based on one of Menzies' specimens: "This species, discovered by Mr. A. Menzies on the West coast of New Holland, is not unlike some varieties of "<a href="Ilex%20aquifolium">Ilex Aquifolium</a>", and now in his Majesty's collection at Kew." The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the specific epithet was not explicitly stated, but it is universally accepted that it comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "sessilis" (<a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>, stalkless), in reference to the sessile leaves of this species. Blame for the alleged <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a> largely fell on <a href="Richard%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a>, who had been present at Brown's readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight's book. Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community, which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible. By the time Brown's monograph appeared in print, Brown had exchanged the generic name "Josephia" for "Dryandra", giving the name "Dryandra floribunda" to Knight's "Josephia sessilis". As there were then no firm rules pertaining to <a href="priority%20%28botany%29">priority</a> of publication, Brown's name was accepted, and remained the current name for over a century.

Another significant early collection was the apparent discovery of the species at the <a href="Swan%20River%2C%20Western%20Australia">Swan River</a> in 1827. In that year, the colonial botanist of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> <a href="Charles%20Fraser%20%28botanist%29">Charles Fraser</a> visited the area as part of an exploring expedition under <a href="James%20Stirling%20%28Australian%20governor%29">James Stirling</a>. Among the plants that Fraser found growing on the south side of the river entrance was "a beautiful species of Dryandra", which was probably this species.

Over the course of the 19th century, the principle of priority in naming gradually came to be accepted by botanists, as did the need for a mechanism by which names in current usage could be <a href="conserved%20name">conserved</a> against archaic or obscure prior names. By the 1920s, "Dryandra" R.Br. was effectively conserved against "Josephia" Knight, although a mechanism for formal conservation was not put in place until 1933. Brown's specific name, however, was not conserved, and <a href="Karel%20Domin">Karel Domin</a> overturned "Dryandra floribunda" R.Br. by transferring Knight's name into "Dryandra" as "Dryandra sessilis" (Knight) Domin in 1924. This name was current until 2007, when all "Dryandra" species were transferred into "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" by <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a>. The full citation for the current name is thus "Banksia sessilis" (Knight) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.

The first common names for this species were literal translations of the scientific names. When published as "Josephia sessilis" in 1809, it was given the common name "sessile Josephia". Brown did not offer a common name when he published "Dryandra floribunda" in 1810, but later that year the "<a href="Hortus%20Kewensis">Hortus Kewensis</a>" translated it as "many flowered dryandra". This name was also used when the plant was featured in "<a href="Curtis%27s%20Botanical%20Magazine">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</a>" in 1813. In Australia, the names "prickly banksia" and "shaving-brush flower" were offered up by <a href="Emily%20Pelloe">Emily Pelloe</a> in 1921, the latter because "when in bud the flower very much resembles a shaving-brush". "Shaving-brush flower" was still in use as late as the 1950s. The name "holly-leaved dryandra" was used when the plant was featured as part of a series of articles in the "<a href="Western%20Mail%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Western Mail</a>" of 1933–34, and this was taken up by <a href="William%20Blackall">William Blackall</a> in 1954, and was still in use as late as 1970. Meanwhile, Gardner used the name "parrot bush" in 1959, a name derived from the observation that the blooms attract parrots., by which the species was already "well-known to bee-keepers". This name was widely adopted, and since 1970 has been in almost exclusive usage.

The only indigenous names reported for the plant are "Budjan" and "But-yak". These were published by Ian Abbott in his 1983 "Aboriginal Names for Plant Species in South-western Australia", with Abbott suggesting that the latter name should be preferred, but with the <a href="orthography">orthography</a> "Pudjak". However, Abbott sources these names to <a href="George%20Fletcher%20Moore">George Fletcher Moore</a>'s 1842 "<a href="A%20Descriptive%20Vocabulary%20of%20the%20Language%20of%20the%20Aborigines">A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines</a>", which in fact attributes these names to the species "Dryandra fraseri" (now "<a href="Banksia%20fraseri">Banksia fraseri</a>"). It is unclear whether Abbott has corrected Moore's error, or introduced an error of his own.

Brown's 1810 monograph did not include an infrageneric classification of "Dryandra", and neither did his "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus</a>", published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra">the first taxonomic arrangement of "Dryandra"</a>, placing "D. floribunda" in section "<a href="Dryandra%20verae">Dryandra verae</a>" along with most other species, because its <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> contain a single seed separator. "Dryandra verae" was renamed "Eudryandra" by <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra">a new arrangement</a>, retaining "D. floribunda" in "D." sect. "Eudryandra", and further placing it in the unranked subgroup <a href="Dryandra%20%C2%A7%20Ilicinae">§ "Ilicinae"</a>, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of "<a href="Ilex">Ilex</a>" (holly). In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra">a revised arrangement</a> in his "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". Bentham retained section "Eudryandra", but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § "Ilicinae". "D. floribunda" was instead placed in <a href="Dryandra%20ser.%20Floribundae">"D." ser. "Floribundae"</a> along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.

Bentham's arrangement stood for over a hundred years, eventually replaced in 1996 by <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra">the arrangement of</a> <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>. Section "Eudryandra" was promoted to subgenus rank, but replaced by the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Dryandra%20subg.%20Dryandra">"D." subg. "Dryandra"</a>. "D. sessilis", as this species was now called, was retained in "D." ser. "Floribundae", but alone, as the series was redefined as containing only those taxa that apparently lack floral bracts altogether. The placement of "D. sessilis" in George's arrangement, with 1999 and 2005 amendments, may be summarised as follows:

George's arrangement remained current until 2007, when <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia". They also published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the "Banksia" taxa having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s, thus redefining <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a> as comprising those that do not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing "Dryandra", so as an interim measure they transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia" at <a href="series%20%28botany%29">series</a> rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, "B. sessilis" is placed in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>, <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">ser. "Dryandra"</a>.

Four <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> are recognised:

"Banksia sessilis" is <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="Southwest%20Botanical%20Province">Southwest Botanical Province</a>, a <a href="floristic%20province">floristic province</a> renowned as a <a href="biodiversity%20hotspot">biodiversity hotspot</a>, located in the southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. "B. sessilis" occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to <a href="Cape%20Leeuwin">Cape Leeuwin</a>, east along the south coast as far as <a href="Bremer%20Bay">Bremer Bay</a>, and inland to <a href="Wongan%20Hills%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wongan Hills</a> and <a href="Kulin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kulin</a>. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the <a href="Karri%20forest">Karri forest</a> in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, "B. sessilis" var. "cordata" occurs along the coast.

The species tolerates a range of soils, requiring only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in <a href="laterite">lateritic</a> soils and gravels, although this species is also found in deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. It also occurs in a range of <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a> complexes, including coastal and <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a>, tall <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, <a href="woodland">woodland</a> and open <a href="forest">forest</a>. It is a common <a href="understory">understorey</a> plant in drier areas of <a href="Jarrah%20forest">Jarrah forest</a>, and forms <a href="thicket">thicket</a>s on limestone soils of the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>. "Banksia sessilis" sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising <a href="gravel%20pit">gravel pit</a>s in the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a>.

Nothing is known of the conditions that affect its distribution, as its <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> is as yet unstudied. An assessment of the potential impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios.

The <a href="nectar">nectar</a> of "B. sessilis" is an important component of the diet of a number of species of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>. In one study, "B. sessilis" was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris niger"), <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus superciliosus"), <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="brown-headed%20honeyeater">brown-headed honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus brevirostris"), and <a href="black%20honeyeater">black honeyeater</a> ("Certhionyx niger"). Moreover, "B. sessilis" played an important role in their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where "B. sessilis" occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where "B. sessilis" is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on "B. sessilis" include the <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="western%20wattlebird">western wattlebird</a> ("A. lunulata"), and <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in <a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">wandoo</a> woodland around <a href="Bakers%20Hill%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bakers Hill</a> found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a "Banksia sessilis" <a href="understory">understory</a>; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9 km south of Jarrahdale, where "B. sessilis" grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after anthesis, where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues.

"Banksia sessilis" is also a source of food for the <a href="Australian%20ringneck">Australian ringneck</a> ("Barnardius zonarius"), and the <a href="long-billed%20black%20cockatoo">long-billed black cockatoo</a> ("Calyptorhynchus baudinii"), which tear open the <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> and consume the seeds.

The introduced <a href="European%20honey%20bee">European honey bee</a> ("Apis mellifera") has also been observed feeding on "B. sessilis", as have seven species of <a href="Australian%20native%20bees">native bee</a>, comprising four species of "<a href="Hylaeus%20%28bee%29">Hylaeus</a>" (including the <a href="banksia%20bee">banksia bee</a> "H. alcyoneus"), two of "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>", and a "<a href="Lasioglossum">Lasioglossum</a>".

Honeyeaters are clearly the most important <a href="pollination">pollination</a> vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving from tree to tree with significant loads of "B. sessilis" pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against <a href="pollen%20presenter">pollen presenter</a>s while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.

The flowers of "B. sessilis" have a number of adaptations that serve to encourage <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a>. Firstly, they are <a href="protandry">protandrous</a>: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether <a href="autogamous">autogamous</a> or <a href="geitonogamous">geitonogamous</a>, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a <a href="mixed-mating%20system">mixed-mating system</a>.
The species is a prolific flowerer, and this, combined with the very high outcrossing rates, results in massive seed output. In one study, the average number of seeds produced per "B. sessilis" plant was 622, compared with an average of 2 for "<a href="Banksia%20dallanneyi">B. dallanneyi</a>". This exceptionally high <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a> can be understood as an adaption to regular bushfire. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a> or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark; "reseeders" are killed by fire, but populations are rapidly re-established through the recruitment of seedlings. "B. sessilis" is a reseeder, but it differs from many other reseeders in not being strongly <a href="serotinous">serotinous</a>: the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in autumn, even in the absence of fire. The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in the scientific literature: it has been treated as "serotinous", "weakly serotinous" and "non-serotinous". Regardless of the terminology used, the massive spontaneous seed output of "B. sessilis" is its primary survival strategy, and is so effective that the species has a reputation as an excellent coloniser. However, this strategy, together with its relatively long juvenile period, makes it vulnerable to overly frequent fire.

Seeds of "B. sessilis" are short-lived, and must germinate in the winter following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, and not a single seed survived one minute of boiling.

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. sessilis" has compound <a href="cluster%20root">cluster root</a>s, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the <a href="leaf%20litter">leaf litter</a>. These exude a range of <a href="carboxylate">carboxylate</a>s, including <a href="citrate">citrate</a>, <a href="malonate">malonate</a> and <a href="trans-aconitate">"trans"-aconitate</a>, that act as <a href="acid%20phosphatase">acid phosphatase</a>, allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>.

"Banksia sessilis" is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", a soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> that causes <a href="root%20rot">root rot</a>; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good <a href="indicator%20species">indicator species</a> for the presence of the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, and in the absence of hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, "B. sessilis", being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus "P. cinnamomi" survives at these sites indefinitely.

The application of <a href="phosphite">phosphite</a> inhibits growth of "P. cinnamomi" in "B. sessilis", but does not kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of "P. cinnamomi" by over 90% in plants infected with "B. sessilis" two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but has been shown to reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.

Infection of coastal stands of "B. sessilis" by the fungus "<a href="Armillaria%20luteobubalina">Armillaria luteobubalina</a>" has also been recorded. The <a href="apparent%20infection%20rate">apparent infection rate</a> of 0.31 is quite slow compared to the progress of other "<a href="Armillaria">Armillaria</a>" species through <a href="pine">pine</a> <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s.

It is not known whether the seed collection sent to the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a>, by Menzies in 1793 included seeds of "B. sessilis", but if it did then it did not germinate. The species was successfully germinated, however, from Good's seed, which was sent from Sydney on 6 June 1802 and arrived at Kew the following year. According to Brown's notes it was flowering at Kew by May 1806, and in 1810 it was reported in the second edition of "Hortus Kewensis" as flowering "most part of the Year". In 1813 a flowering specimen from the nursery of Malcolm and Sweet was featured as Plate 1581 in "<a href="Curtis%27s%20Botanical%20Magazine">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</a>".
By the 1830s the species was in cultivation in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated in the garden of <a href="Karl%20von%20H%C3%BCgel">Karl von Hügel</a> in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a> in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at <a href="Utrecht%20%28city%29">Utrecht</a> and <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a> in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae, and by the end of the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.

In Australia, there was little interest in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as <a href="wildflower">wildflower</a>s. For example, in 1933 and 1934 "<a href="Western%20Mail%20%28Western%20Australia%29">The Western Mail</a>" published a series of <a href="Edgar%20Dell">Edgar Dell</a> paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of "B. sessilis". These were subsequently republished in <a href="Charles%20Gardner">Charles Gardner</a>'s 1935 "West Australian Wild Flowers". One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in <a href="William%20Blackall">William Blackall</a>'s 1954 "<a href="How%20to%20know%20Western%20Australian%20wildflowers">How to know Western Australian wildflowers</a>", but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 "Wildflowers of Western Australia", and in the 1973 "Flowers and plants of Western Australia", but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.

Possibly the first published information on the cultivation of "Dryandra" appeared in the magazine "<a href="Australian%20Native%20Plants%20Society%20%28Australia%29%23Australian%20Plants">Australian Plants</a>" in June and September 1961. "D. sessilis" was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.

From its inception in 1962, the <a href="Kings%20Park%20and%20Botanic%20Garden">Kings Park and Botanic Garden</a> undertook extensive research into the cultivation of native plants, resulting in two early publications that mentioned the cultivation potential of "B. sessilis". In 1965, <a href="John%20Stanley%20Beard">John Stanley Beard</a> published "Descriptive catalogue of Western Australian plants", "a work of reference in which the horticultural characteristics of the plants concerned could be looked up by the staff", which described "D. sessilis" as an erect shrub with pale yellow flowers appearing from May to October, growing in sand and gravel. Five years later, Arthur Fairall published "West Australian native plants in cultivation". This presented largely the same information as Beard's "catalogue", adding only that the species flowers well in its third season.

According to current knowledge, "B. sessilis" as an extremely hardy plant that grows in a range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with <a href="Beekeeping">beekeepers</a>. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from <a href="cutting">cutting</a>s has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.

Banksia blechnifolia

Banksia blechnifolia is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>". It was first described by Victorian state botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> in 1864, and no subspecies are recognised. It gained its specific name as its leaves are reminiscent of a fern ("<a href="Blechnum">Blechnum</a>"). "B. blechnifolia" is one of several closely related species that grow as <a href="prostrate%20shrub">prostrate shrub</a>s, with horizontal stems and thick, leathery upright leaves. The red-brown flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are up to high and appear from September to November. As the spikes age, each turns grey and develops as many as 25 woody seed pods, known as <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>.

Insects such as bees, wasps, ants and flies pollinate the flowers. Found in sandy soils in the south coastal region of Western Australia in the vicinity of <a href="Lake%20King%2C%20Western%20Australia">Lake King</a>, "B. blechnifolia" is non-<a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>ous, regenerating by seed after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>. The plant adapts readily to cultivation, growing in well-drained sandy soils in sunny locations. It is suitable for <a href="Rock%20garden">rockeries</a> and as a <a href="groundcover">groundcover</a>.

"Banksia blechnifolia" is a <a href="prostrate%20shrub">prostrate shrub</a> that grows to about high and spreads to across. It has thick horizontal stems up to long and thick that lie on top of the ground. They are covered in fine rusty-brown fur, which turns grey with age. The leathery <a href="herringbone%20pattern">herringbone</a> leaves rise vertically from the stems on thick long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>, which have two narrow ribs on the undersurface. The leaves themselves are long, with 8–22 deep lobes on each leaf edge. Narrowly triangular to roughly linear in shape and long, these lobes are either oppositely or alternately <a href="phyllotaxis">arranged</a> along the leaf midline, and arise at 60–80 degrees. The leaf blade narrows for the top third of its length to a pointed apex. Flowering occurs from mid September to late November, with the flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, arising at the ends of the stems. Up to high and wide, they are overall red-brown to salmon-coloured. The individual flowers are reddish pink with a cream base, fading to light brown and then grey as they age. The <a href="perianth">perianth</a> is long, includes a 3.5–5 mm limb and is covered in fine fur. Old flowers remain on the spike, obscuring the developing seed pods known as <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. Up to 25 in number, these are covered in fur and oval, measuring long, by high, and wide.

The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) to cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed is long. It is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body (containing the <a href="Plant%20embryogenesis">embryonic</a> plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, termed the outer surface, is convex and pale greyish brown with irregular pits and the inner surface is dark brown and smooth. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. The first pair of leaves produced by seedlings, known as <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s, are wedge-shaped with a convex apical side and measure long by wide. Dark green in colour, they are faintly reticulated. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The cotyledons sit on a short thick <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a>.

Victorian state botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> first described "Banksia blechnifolia" in 1864, from material collected in 1861 by a G. Maxwell. The species name is derived from "<a href="Blechnum">Blechnum</a>" a genus of fern, and "folium" "leaf", hence "fern-leaved". Von Mueller held it to be close to , but in his 1870 <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arrangement</a>, English botanist George Bentham regarded it as <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with that species. Von Mueller wrote of it again in 1869 as a variety of "B. repens", giving it the name "Banksia pinnatisecta". The species was then mostly forgotten until 1931, when it was collected again by Western Australian botanists <a href="William%20Blackall">William Blackall</a> and <a href="Charles%20Gardner">Charles Gardner</a> near <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Middle Mount Barren</a>. As the region was opened up to agriculture, the species was collected more often during the following decades. It was informally known as "Banksia" sp. "Lake King" during this time and was brought into cultivation. No subspecies are recognized.

In his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", Australian botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> resurrected "B. blechnifolia" as a valid species, placing it in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subgenus "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike shape, in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." section "Banksia"</a> because of its straight styles, and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Prostratae">"Banksia" series "Prostratae"</a>, because of its prostrate habit, along with five other closely related species. George, like von Mueller, held it to be related to "B. repens" and . In 1996, botanists <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published an arrangement informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">This arrangement</a> maintained the species' placement in ser. "Prostratae" but found the most closely related <a href="taxon">taxon</a> to be , based on their common narrow-lobed leaves, and the next closest relative to be "B. repens". George later published an updated version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. In all three arrangements, section "Prostratae" is circumscribed with little to no differences, though its placement within the broader system differs. The placement of "B. blechnifolia" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>, which includes "Banksia". With respect to "B. blechnifolia", Mast's results have some semblance to George and Thiele's, as "B. repens", "B. chamaephyton" and "B. blechnifolia" form a closely knit group within this group, although the overall inferred <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksiinae" by publishing several new names, including subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"Spathulatae"</a> for the species of "Banksia" that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> "B." subgenus "Banksia". They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. blechnifolia" is placed in subgenus "Banksia". In a 2013 cladistics study, evolutionary scientists Marcell Cardillo and Renae Pratt found that "B. blechnifolia" diverged from a lineage that gave rise to "<a href="Banksia%20goodii">B. goodii</a>", "B. gardneri" and "B. repens".

Endemic to Western Australia, "B. blechnifolia" is found in the state's south between <a href="Jerramungup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Jerramungup</a> and <a href="Gibson%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gibson</a>, and north towards the vicinity of Lake King. It grows in flat areas, on white sands in <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> or mallee kwongan communities. It is not found within of the coast.

Like many plants in Australia's southwest, "Banksia blechnifolia" is adapted to an environment in which <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "B. blechnifolia" and the related "B. petiolaris" are in the former category—rapid growing plants killed by <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> and regenerating by <a href="seed">seed</a>—while the other prostrate species are slow growing resprouters.

Like other banksias, "B. blechnifolia" plays host to a variety of pollinators – insects such as bees, wasps, ants and flies were all recorded in the 1988 "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" survey.

Inoculation experiments found that "B. blechnifolia" is resistant to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a>. It is one of the Western Australian banksia species that adapts best to cultivation, having been readily grown in eastern states. Rusty new growth and fern-like leaves are its main horticultural features. It requires well-drained soil, preferably fairly sandy, although it can tolerate some clay. Extra water in warm weather can result in vigorous growth. Some specimens reach diameter in cultivation. It makes an attractive prostrate groundcover, especially in rockeries, though its growth is not dense enough to suppress weeds arising within it. Ample mulching minimises weed growth. It is hardy to moderate frosts.

Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. "B. blechnifolia" takes 4–5 years to flower from seed in cultivation.

The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)

The Cat and the Canary is a 1927 American <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> adaptation of <a href="John%20Willard%20%28playwright%29">John Willard</a>'s 1922 <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> play of the <a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%28play%29">same name</a>. Directed by <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> filmmaker <a href="Paul%20Leni">Paul Leni</a>, the film stars <a href="Laura%20La%20Plante">Laura La Plante</a> as Annabelle West, <a href="Forrest%20Stanley">Forrest Stanley</a> as Charles "Charlie" Wilder, and <a href="Creighton%20Hale">Creighton Hale</a> as Paul Jones. The plot revolves around the death of Cyrus West, who is Annabelle, Charlie, and Paul's uncle, and the reading of his <a href="last%20will%20and%20testament">will</a> 20 years later. Annabelle inherits her uncle's fortune, but when she and her family spend the night in his haunted mansion they are stalked by a mysterious figure. Meanwhile, a <a href="lunatic">lunatic</a> known as "the Cat" escapes from an asylum and hides in the mansion.

The film is part of a genre of <a href="List%20of%20comedy%20horror%20films">comedy horror film</a>s inspired by 1920s <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> stage plays. Paul Leni's adaptation of Willard's play blended expressionism with humor, a style Leni was notable for and critics recognized as unique. Leni's style of directing made "The Cat and the Canary" influential in the "old dark house" genre of films popular from the 1930s through the 1950s. The film was one of <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a>'s early horror productions and is considered "the cornerstone of <a href="Universal%20Monsters">Universal's school of horror</a>." The play has been filmed five other times, with the <a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%281939%20film%29">most notable</a> in 1939 starring comedic actor <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Paulette%20Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a>.

In a decaying mansion overlooking the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like "cats around a canary", causing him to become <a href="Insanity">insane</a>. West orders that his <a href="Will%20%28law%29">last will and testament</a> remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby (<a href="Tully%20Marshall">Tully Marshall</a>), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (<a href="Martha%20Mattox">Martha Mattox</a>), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.
As midnight approaches, West's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe (<a href="Arthur%20Edmund%20Carewe">Arthur Edmund Carewe</a>), Charles "Charlie" Wilder, Paul Jones, his sister Susan Sillsby (<a href="Flora%20Finch">Flora Finch</a>) and her niece Cecily Young (<a href="Gertrude%20Astor">Gertrude Astor</a>), and niece Annabelle West. Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name "West": Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (<a href="Lucien%20Littlefield">Lucien Littlefield</a>). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, "in a cage surrounded by cats."

While the family prepares for dinner, a guard (<a href="George%20Siegmann">George Siegmann</a>) barges in and announces that an escaped <a href="lunatic">lunatic</a> called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds. The guard tells Cecily, "He's a maniac who thinks he's a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!" Meanwhile, Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. Before he speaks the person's name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying Annabelle. When she explains what happened to Crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane.

Alone in her assigned room, Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn.

While Annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in <a href="Hysteria">hysteric</a>s and hitches a ride with a milkman (<a href="Joe%20Murphy%20%28actor%29">Joe Murphy</a>). Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.


"The Cat and the Canary" is the product of early 20th century German <a href="Expressionism%23In%20other%20media">expressionism</a>. According to art historian Joan Weinstein, expressionism includes the art styles of <a href="Die%20Br%C3%BCcke">Die Brücke</a> and <a href="Der%20Blaue%20Reiter">Der Blaue Reiter</a>, <a href="cubism">cubism</a>, <a href="Futurism%20%28art%29">futurism</a>, and <a href="Abstract%20art">abstraction</a>. The key element that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over <a href="verisimilitude">verisimilitude</a> to nature. Film historian Richard Peterson notes that "<a href="Cinema%20of%20Germany">German cinema</a> became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through lighting, set design and camera angles." Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes. Influential examples of German expressionist film include <a href="Robert%20Wiene">Robert Wiene</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cabinet%20of%20Dr.%20Caligari%20%281920%20film%29">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>" (1920) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni's "<a href="Waxworks%20%28film%29">Waxworks</a>" (1925) about a <a href="wax%20museum">wax figure display</a> at a fair.

"Waxworks" impressed <a href="Carl%20Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, the German-born president of <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. Laemmle was struck by Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes. Meanwhile, in the United States, <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a>'s "<a href="One%20Exciting%20Night">One Exciting Night</a>" (1922) began a <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic horror</a> film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Green">Alfred E. Green</a>'s now lost "<a href="The%20Ghost%20Breaker%20%281922%20film%29">The Ghost Breaker</a>" (1922), <a href="Frank%20Tuttle">Frank Tuttle</a>'s "<a href="Puritan%20Passions">Puritan Passions</a>" (1923), <a href="Roland%20West">Roland West</a>'s "<a href="The%20Monster%20%281925%20film%29">The Monster</a>" (1925) and "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281926%20film%29">The Bat</a>" (1926), and <a href="Alfred%20Santell">Alfred Santell</a>'s "<a href="The%20Gorilla%20%281927%20film%29">The Gorilla</a>" (1927)—all comedy horror film adaptations of <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> stage plays—proved successful.

Laemmle turned to John Willard's popular play "The Cat and the Canary", which centered on an heiress whose family tries to drive her insane to steal her inheritance. Willard hesitated in permitting Laemmle to film his play because, as historian Douglas Brode explains, "that would have exposed to virtually everyone the trick ending, ... destroying the play's potential as an ongoing moneymaker." Nevertheless, Willard was convinced and the play was adapted into a screenplay by <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Cohn">Alfred A. Cohn</a> and <a href="Robert%20F.%20Hill">Robert F. Hill</a>.

"The Cat and the Canary" features veteran silent film stars <a href="Laura%20La%20Plante">Laura La Plante</a>, <a href="Creighton%20Hale">Creighton Hale</a>, and <a href="Forrest%20Stanley">Forrest Stanley</a>. La Plante played roles in more than 50 films before starring in "The Cat and the Canary". According to film historian <a href="Gary%20Don%20Rhodes">Gary Don Rhodes</a>, her part in "The Cat and the Canary" was typical for women in horror and mystery films: "The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She has little to do, and so the question becomes 'What will be done "with" her?'" Rhodes adds, "The heroines are young and beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed—whether “stolen” by a villain or “owned” by a young hero at the films' conclusions." Following "The Cat and the Canary", La Plante maintained a career with Universal, but she is described as a "victim of <a href="Sound%20film">talkies</a>." She received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> before her death in 1996 from <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Universal chose <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> actor Creighton Hale to play hero Paul Jones, Annabelle's cousin. Hale had appeared in 64 silent films before "The Cat and the Canary", notably the 1914 <a href="Serial%20%28film%29">serial</a> "<a href="The%20Exploits%20of%20Elaine">The Exploits of Elaine</a>" and D. W. Griffith's "<a href="Way%20Down%20East">Way Down East</a>" (1920) and "<a href="Orphans%20of%20the%20Storm">Orphans of the Storm</a>" (1921). Hale's role in "The Cat and the Canary" was to provide <a href="comedic%20relief">comedic relief</a>. According to critic John Howard Reid, "He is forever backing into furniture or finding himself in a risqué position under a bed or wrestling with stray objects like falling books or enormous bed-springs." Hale had trouble finding a solid career in sound film. Many of his parts were minor and uncredited.

The villain Charles Wilder was played by Forrest Stanley, an actor who had been cast in films such as "<a href="Bavu">Bavu</a>" (1923), "<a href="Through%20the%20Dark%20%281924%20film%29">Through the Dark</a>" (1924) and "<a href="Shadow%20of%20the%20Law">Shadow of the Law</a>" (1926). After his performance in "The Cat and the Canary", Stanley played lesser roles in films such as "<a href="Show%20Boat%20%281936%20film%29">Show Boat</a>" (1936) and "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Undead">Curse of the Undead</a>" (1959) and the television series "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>", "<a href="Studio%2057">Studio 57</a>", and "<a href="Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a>".

The film contained a supporting cast referred to by one film historian as "second-rate" and "excellent" by another. <a href="Tully%20Marshall">Tully Marshall</a> played the suspicious lawyer Roger Crosby, <a href="Martha%20Mattox">Martha Mattox</a> was cast as the sinister and superstitious housekeeper Mammy Pleasant, and <a href="Gertrude%20Astor">Gertrude Astor</a> and <a href="Flora%20Finch">Flora Finch</a> played greedy relatives Cecily Young and Aunt Susan Sillsby, respectively. <a href="Lucien%20Littlefield">Lucien Littlefield</a> was cast as deranged <a href="Psychiatry">psychiatrist</a> Dr. Ira Lazar who bore an eerie resemblance to <a href="Werner%20Krauss">Werner Krauss</a>'s title character in "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari".

As Universal anticipated, director Paul Leni turned Willard's play into an expressionist film suited to an American audience. Historian Bernard F. Dick observes that "Leni reduced German expressionism, with its weird <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>, asymmetric sets, and excessive stylization, to a format compatible with American film practice." Jenn Dlugos argues that "many stage play movie adaptations [of the 1920s] fall into the trap of looking like 'a stage play taped for the big screen' with minimal emphasis on the environment and plenty of stage play overacting." This, however, was not the case for Leni's film. Richard Scheib notes that "Leni's style is something that lifts "The Cat and the Canary" up and away from being merely a filmed stage play and gives it an amazing visual dynamism."

Leni used similar camera effects found in German expressionist films such as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to set the atmosphere of "The Cat and the Canary". The film opens with a hand wiping cobwebs away to reveal the title credits. Other effects include "dramatic shadows, portentous <a href="superimposition">superimposition</a>s and moody sequences in which the camera glides through corridors with billowing curtains." Film historian Jan-Christopher Horak explains that a "<a href="Film%20transition">matched dissolve</a> from an image of the mansion and its oddly shaped towers to the oversized bottles of medicine that the dearly departed has been forced to consume functions as a double image of a prison, dwarfing the old man who sits alive with his will in a corner of the frame." Leni worked with the cast to add to the mood created by lighting and camera angles. <a href="Cinematographer">Cinematographer</a> <a href="Gilbert%20Warrenton">Gilbert Warrenton</a> recalled that Leni used a <a href="gong">gong</a> to startle the actors. Warrenton mused, "He beat that thing worse than the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> beat a drum."

While the film contains elements of horror, according to film historian Dennis L. White it "is structured with an end other than horror in mind. Some scenes may achieve horror, and some characters dramatically experience horror, but for these films conventional clues and a logical explanation, at least an explanation plausible in hindsight, are usually crucial, and are of necessity their makers' first concern."

Besides directing, Leni was a painter and set designer. The sets of the film were designed by Leni and fabricated by <a href="Charles%20D.%20Hall">Charles D. Hall</a>, who later designed the sets of "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>" (1931) and "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281931%20film%29">Frankenstein</a>" (1931). Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters. He wrote, "It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives, but the reality of the inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving than what we see through everyday eyes ..." Leni went on to direct the <a href="Charlie%20Chan">Charlie Chan</a> film "<a href="The%20Chinese%20Parrot%20%28film%29">The Chinese Parrot</a>" (1927), "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Laughs%20%281928%20film%29">The Man Who Laughs</a>" (1928), and "<a href="The%20Last%20Warning">The Last Warning</a>" (1929) before his death in 1929 from <a href="Bacteremia">blood poisoning</a>.

"The Cat and the Canary" debuted in New York City's Colony Theatre on September 9, 1927, and was a "box office success". "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" opined, "What distinguishes Universal's film version of the ... play is Paul Leni's intelligent handling of a weird theme, introducing some of his novel settings and ideas with which he became identified ... The film runs a bit overlong ... Otherwise it's a more than average satisfying feature ..." A "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" review expounded, "This is a film which ought to be exhibited before many other directors to show them how a story should be told, for in all that he does Mr. Leni does not seem to strain at a point. He does it as naturally as a man twisting the ends of his mustache in thought." Nonetheless, as film historian Bernard F. Dick points out, "[e]xponents of "Caligarisme", expressionism in the extreme ... naturally thought Leni had vulgarized the conventions [of expressionism]". Dick, however, notes that Leni had only "lighten[ed] [expressionist themes] so they could enter American cinema without the baggage of a movement that had spiraled out of control."

Modern critics address the film's impact and influence. Michael Atkinson of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" remarks, "[Leni's] adroitly atmospheric film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact"; Chris Dashiell states that "[e]verything is so exaggerated, so lacking in subtlety, that we soon stop caring what happens, despite a few mildly scary effects", although he admits that the film "had a great effect on the horror genre, and even <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> cited it as an influence." <a href="Tony%20Rayns">Tony Rayns</a> has called the film "the definitive 'haunted house' movie ... Leni wisely plays it mainly for laughs, but his prowling, <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Murnau">Murnau</a>-like camera work generates a frisson or two along the way. It is, in fact, hugely entertaining ..." John Calhoun feels that what makes the film both "important and influential" was "Leni's uncanny ability to bring out the period's <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a> elements in the story's hackneyed conventions: the sliding panels and disappearing acts are so fast paced and expertly timed that the picture looks like a first-rate door-slamming farce ... At the same time, Leni didn't short-circuit the horrific aspects ..."

Although not the first film set in a supposed <a href="haunted%20house">haunted house</a>, "The Cat and the Canary" started the pattern for the "old dark house" genre. The term is derived from English director <a href="James%20Whale">James Whale</a>'s "<a href="The%20Old%20Dark%20House">The Old Dark House</a>" (1932), which was heavily influenced by Leni's film, and refers to "films in which murders are committed by masked killers in old mansions." Supernatural events in the film are all explained at the film's conclusion as the work of a criminal. Other films in this genre influenced by "The Cat and the Canary" include "The Last Warning", "<a href="House%20on%20Haunted%20Hill">House on Haunted Hill</a>" (1959), and the monster films of <a href="Abbott%20and%20Costello">Abbott and Costello</a> and <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>.

A tinted version produced by David Shepard, film preservationist, was released on both <a href="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in 1997 and 2005 by <a href="Image%20Entertainment">Image Entertainment</a>. The 2005 "Special Edition" contains an original score by Franklin Stover. The original black-and-white version airs infrequently on the <a href="cable%20television">cable television</a> network <a href="Turner%20Classic%20Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a>.

In 2001, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> nominated this film for <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Thrills">AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills</a>.

"The Cat and the Canary" has been filmed five other times. <a href="Rupert%20Julian">Rupert Julian</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cat%20Creeps">The Cat Creeps</a>" (1930) and the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a> "<a href="La%20Voluntad%20del%20muerto">La Voluntad del muerto</a>" ("The Will of the Dead Man") directed by <a href="George%20Melford">George Melford</a> and <a href="Enrique%20Tovar%20%C3%81valos">Enrique Tovar Ávalos</a> were the first talkie versions of the play; they were produced and distributed by Universal Pictures in 1930. Although the first sound films produced by Universal, neither was as influential on the genre as the first film and "The Cat Creeps" is <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

The plot had become too familiar, as film historian Douglas Brode notes, and it "seemed likely the play would be put away in a drawer [indefinitely]." Yet <a href="Elliott%20Nugent">Elliott Nugent</a>'s film, "<a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%281939%20film%29">The Cat and the Canary</a>" (1939), proved successful. Nugent "had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs." The film was produced by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a> and starred comedic actor <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. In later years, Universal themselves <a href="EMKA%2C%20Ltd.">acquired the rights</a> to the 1939 version.

Other film adaptations include "<a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%281961%20film%29">Katten och kanariefågeln</a>" ("The Cat and the Canary"), a 1961 Swedish television film directed by <a href="Jan%20Molander">Jan Molander</a> and "<a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%281979%20film%29">The Cat and the Canary</a>" (1979), a British film directed by <a href="Radley%20Metzger">Radley Metzger</a>. The 1979 version was produced by <a href="Richard%20Gordon%20%28film%20producer%29">Richard Gordon</a>, who explains why he and Metzger made their film version: "Well, it hadn't been done since the Bob Hope version, it had never been done in colour, it was a well-known title, had a certain reputation, and it was something that logically could or in fact "should" be made in England."

The Tower House

The Tower House, 29 Melbury Road, is a late-Victorian <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a> in the <a href="Holland%20Park">Holland Park</a> district of <a href="Royal%20Borough%20of%20Kensington%20and%20Chelsea">Kensington and Chelsea</a>, London, built by the architect and designer <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a> as his home. Designed between 1875 and 1881, in the French <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style, it was described by the architectural historian <a href="J.%20Mordaunt%20Crook">J. Mordaunt Crook</a> as "the most complete example of a medieval secular interior produced by the Gothic Revival, and the last". The house is built of red brick, with <a href="Bath%20stone">Bath stone</a> dressings and green roof slates from <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, and has a distinctive cylindrical tower and conical roof. The ground floor contains a drawing room, a dining room and a library, while the first floor has two bedrooms and an armoury. Its exterior and the interior echo elements of Burges's earlier work, particularly the <a href="Park%20House%2C%20Cardiff">McConnochie House</a> in Cardiff and <a href="Castell%20Coch">Castell Coch</a>. It was designated a <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I</a> listed building in 1949.

Burges bought the lease on the plot of land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with interior decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including <a href="Thomas%20Nicholls%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Nicholls</a> and <a href="Henry%20Stacy%20Marks">Henry Stacy Marks</a>. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, <a href="Richard%20Popplewell%20Pullan">Richard Popplewell Pullan</a>. It was later sold to Colonel T. H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E. R. B. Graham. The poet <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following a period when the house stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor <a href="Richard%20Harris">Richard Harris</a> and then by the musician <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>.

The house retains most of its internal structural decoration, but much of the furniture, fittings and contents that Burges designed has been dispersed. Many items, including the <a href="Great%20Bookcase">Great Bookcase</a>, the <a href="Zodiac%20settle">Zodiac settle</a>, the <a href="Golden%20Bed">Golden Bed</a> and the <a href="The%20Red%20Bed">Red Bed</a>, are now in institutions such as <a href="The%20Higgins%20Art%20Gallery%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum</a> and the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, while others are in private collections.

The Tower House is on a corner of Melbury Road, just north of <a href="Kensington%20High%20Street">Kensington High Street</a>, in the district of <a href="Holland%20Park">Holland Park</a>. It stands opposite Stavordvale Lodge and next to <a href="Woodland%20House">Woodland House</a>, built for the artist <a href="Luke%20Fildes">Luke Fildes</a>. The development of Melbury Road in the grounds of <a href="Little%20Holland%20House">Little Holland House</a> created an <a href="art%20colony">art colony</a> in Holland Park, the <a href="Holland%20Park%20Circle">Holland Park Circle</a>. Its most prominent member, <a href="Frederic%20Leighton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Leighton">Frederic, Lord Leighton</a>, lived at <a href="Leighton%20House%20Museum">Leighton House</a>, 12 Holland Park Road, and at the time of Leighton's death in 1896 six <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academicians</a>, as well as one associate member, were living in Holland Park Road and Melbury Road.

In 1863, <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a> gained his first major architectural commission, <a href="Saint%20Fin%20Barre%27s%20Cathedral">Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral</a>, <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, at the age of 35. In the following twelve years, his architecture, metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass led Crook to claim that Burges rivaled <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Pugin</a> as "the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival". But by 1875, his short career was largely over. Although he worked to finalise earlier projects, he received no further major commissions, and the design, construction, decoration and furnishing of the Tower House occupied much of the last six years of his life. In December 1875, after rejecting plots in Victoria Road, Kensington and <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a>, Burges purchased the leasehold of the plot in Melbury Road from the <a href="Henry%20Fox-Strangways%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Ilchester">Earl of Ilchester</a>, the owner of the Holland Estate. The <a href="ground%20rent">ground rent</a> was £100 per annum. Initial drawings for the house had been undertaken in July 1875 and the final form was decided upon by the end of the year. Building began in 1876, contracted to the Ashby Brothers of Kingsland Road at a cost of £6,000.

At the Tower House Burges drew on his own "experience of twenty years learning, travelling and building", and used many of the artists and craftsmen who had worked with him on earlier buildings. An estimate book compiled by him, and now in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, contains the names of the individuals and companies that worked at the house. <a href="Thomas%20Nicholls%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Nicholls</a> was responsible for the stone carving, including the <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a>s, <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s and the chimneypieces. The <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> and marble work was contracted to Burke and Company of <a href="Regent%20Street">Regent Street</a>, while the decorative tiles were supplied by W. B. Simpson and Sons Ltd of <a href="Strand%2C%20London">the Strand</a>. John Ayres Hatfield crafted the bronze decorations on the doors, while the woodwork was the responsibility of John Walden of <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>. <a href="Henry%20Stacy%20Marks">Henry Stacy Marks</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Weekes">Frederick Weekes</a> were employed to decorate the walls with murals, and Campbell and Smith of <a href="Southampton%20Row">Southampton Row</a> had responsibility for most of the painted decoration. Marks painted birds above the <a href="frieze">frieze</a> in the library, and the illustrations of famous lovers in the drawing-room were by Weekes. They also painted the figures on the bookcases in the library. The stained glass was by <a href="William%20Gualbert%20Saunders">Saunders and Company</a> of Long Acre, with initial designs by <a href="Horatio%20Walter%20Lonsdale">Horatio Walter Lonsdale</a>.

Burges spent his first night at the house on 5 March 1878. It provided a suitable backdrop for entertaining his range of friends, "the whole gamut of <a href="Pre-Raphaelite">Pre-Raphaelite</a> London." His dogs, Dandie, Bogie and Pinkie, are immortalised in paintings on various pieces of furniture such as the Dog Cabinet and the foot of <a href="The%20Red%20Bed">The Red Bed</a>. Burges displayed his extensive collection of armour in the armoury. The decoration of his bedroom hints at another of his passions: a fondness for <a href="opium">opium</a>. Stylised poppies cover the panels of a cupboard which was set next to his bed.

In 1881, after catching a chill while overseeing work at Cardiff, Burges returned, half paralysed, to the house where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and <a href="James%20Abbott%20McNeill%20Whistler">James Whistler</a>. Burges died in the <a href="The%20Red%20Bed">Red Bed</a> on 20 April 1881, just over three years after moving into the Tower House; he was 53 years old. He was buried in <a href="West%20Norwood%20Cemetery">West Norwood Cemetery</a>.

The lease on the house was inherited by Burges's brother-in-law, <a href="Richard%20Popplewell%20Pullan">Richard Popplewell Pullan</a>. Pullan completed some of Burges's unfinished projects and wrote two studies of his work. The lease was then purchased by Colonel T. H. Minshall, author of "What to Do with Germany" and "Future Germany", and father of <a href="Merlin%20Minshall">Merlin Minshall</a>. Minshall sold his lease to Colonel E. R. B. and Mrs. Graham in 1933. The Tower House was designated a <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I</a> listed building on 29 July 1949.

<a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> was a friend of the Grahams and was given the remaining two-year lease on the house, together with some of the furniture, on Mrs. Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman, a champion of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture, was an early admirer of Burges. In 1957 the Tower House had featured in the fifth episode of his BBC television series, "An Englishman's Castle". In a radio interview of 1952 about <a href="Cardiff%20Castle">Cardiff Castle</a> Betjeman spoke of the architect and his foremost work: "a great brain has made this place. I don't see how anyone can fail to be impressed by its weird beauty ... awed into silence from the force of this Victorian dream of the Middle Ages."

Because of a potential liability for £10,000 of renovation work upon the expiry of the lease, Betjeman considered the house too costly to maintain, and subsequently vacated it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood empty and suffered vandalism and neglect. A survey undertaken in January 1965 revealed that the exterior stonework was badly decayed, dry rot had eaten through the roof and the structural floor timbers, and the attics were infested with pigeons. Vandals had stripped the lead from the water tanks and had damaged the mirrors, fireplaces and carving work. The most notable loss was the theft of the carved figure of "Fame" from the Dining Room chimneypiece. Betjeman suggested that the owner's agents had deliberately refused to let the house, and allowed it to decline, intending to demolish it and redevelop the site. Writing in <a href="Country%20Life%20%28magazine%29">"Country Life"</a> in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took a different view saying that "the <a href="Earl%20of%20Ilchester">Ilchester Estate</a>, upon which the house is situated, are anxious that it should be preserved and [have] entered into a long lease conditional upon the house being put into a state of good repair." In March 1965, the <a href="Historic%20Buildings%20Council">Historic Buildings Council</a> obtained a preservation order on the house, enabling the purchaser of the lease, Lady Jane Turnbull, daughter of <a href="William%20Grey%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford</a>, to initiate a programme of restoration the following July. These renovations were supported by grants of £4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and £3,000 from the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a>. The lease was sold in 1969.

The actor <a href="Richard%20Harris">Richard Harris</a> bought the lease for £75,000 in 1969 after discovering that the American entertainer <a href="Liberace">Liberace</a> had made an offer but had not put down a deposit. Reading of the intended sale in the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>", Harris bought it the following day, describing his purchase as the biggest gift he had ever given himself. In his autobiography, the entertainer <a href="Danny%20La%20Rue">Danny La Rue</a> recalled visiting the house with Liberace, writing, "It was a strange building and had eerie murals painted on the ceiling ... I sensed evil". Meeting La Rue later, Harris said he had found the house haunted by the ghosts of children from an orphanage that had previously occupied the site and that he had placated them by buying them toys. Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith & Company Ltd., to carry out restoration, using Burges's drawings from the Victoria and Albert Museum.

<a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>, the <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> guitarist, bought the house from Harris in 1972 for £350,000, outbidding the musician <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>. Page, an enthusiast of Burges and for the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a>, commented in an interview in 2012: "I was still finding things 20 years after being there – a little beetle on the wall or something like that; it's Burges's attention to detail that is so fascinating." In 2015 Page successfully challenged a planning application lodged by the pop star <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>, who had purchased the adjacent <a href="Woodland%20House">Woodland House</a> in 2013 and planned extensive renovations. Page argued that the alterations, particularly the intended underground excavations, would threaten the structure of the Tower House. Ongoing disagreements between Williams and Page over the former’s development plans continue to feature in Britain’s tabloid and music press.

The cultural historian Caroline Dakers wrote that the Tower House was a "pledge to the spirit of Gothic in an area given over to Queen Anne". Burges loathed the <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne style</a> prevalent in Holland Park, writing that it: "like other fashions ... will have its day, I do not call it Queen Anne art, for, unfortunately I see no art in it at all". His inspirations were <a href="French%20Gothic%20architecture">French Gothic domestic architecture</a> of the thirteenth century and more recent models drawn from the work of the nineteenth-century French architect <a href="Viollet-le-Duc">Viollet-le-Duc</a>. Architectural historians <a href="Gavin%20Stamp">Gavin Stamp</a> and Colin Amery considered that the building "sums up Burges in miniature. Although clearly a redbrick suburban house, it is massive, picturesquely composed, with a prominent tourelle for the staircase which is surmounted by a conical roofed turret." Burges's neighbour Luke Fildes described the house as a "model modern house of moderately large size in the 13th-century style built to show what may be done for 19th-century everyday wants".

The house has an L-shaped plan, and the exterior is plain, of red brick, with <a href="Bath%20stone">Bath stone</a> dressings and green roof slates from Cumberland. With a floor plan of 50 feet by square, , Burges went about its construction on a grand scale. The architect <a href="Richard%20Norman%20Shaw">R. Norman Shaw</a> remarked that the concrete foundations were suitable "for a fortress". This approach, combined with Burges's architectural skills and the minimum of exterior decoration, created a building that Crook described as "simple and massive". Following his usual pattern, Burges re-worked many elements of earlier designs, adapting them as appropriate. The frontages come from the other townhouse he designed, the <a href="Park%20House%2C%20Cardiff">McConnochie House</a> in Cardiff, although they have been reversed, with the <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcaded</a>, street front from the McConnochie House forming the garden front of the Tower House. The staircase is consigned to the conical tower, avoiding the error Burges made at the earlier house, where he placed the staircase in the middle of the hall. The cylindrical tower and conical roof derive from <a href="Castell%20Coch">Castell Coch</a>, and the interiors are inspired from examples at Cardiff Castle. The house has two main floors, with a basement below and a <a href="garret">garret</a> above. The ground floor contains a drawing room, a dining room and a library, while the first floor has two bedrooms and an armoury.
The architectural writer <a href="Bridget%20Cherry">Bridget Cherry</a> wrote that "the sturdy exterior gives little hint of the fantasy [Burges] created inside", interiors which the art historian and Burges scholar <a href="Charles%20Handley-Read">Charles Handley-Read</a> described as "at once opulent, aggressive, obsessional, enchanting, their grandeur border[ing] on grandiloquence". Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: in the hall it is Time; in the drawing room, Love; in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate <a href="Overdoor">overmantels</a> were carved and installed, described by Crook as "veritable altars of art ... some of the most amazing pieces of decoration Burges ever designed". Handley-Read considered that Burges's decorations were "unique, almost magical [and] quite unlike anything designed by his contemporaries".

A bronze-covered door, with relief panels depicting figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time the door had a letterbox, in the form of <a href="Mercury%20%28mythology%29">Mercury</a>, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H. W. Lonsdale, it resembles the "cave canem" floor at <a href="Pompei">Pompei</a>.

The interior centres on the double-height entrance hall, with the theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the <a href="astrological%20sign">astrological sign</a>s of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a> design, with the centre depicting the myth of <a href="Theseus%23The%20myth%20of%20Theseus%20and%20the%20Minotaur">Theseus slaying the Minotaur</a>. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna and Child</a>. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked the door to the garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.

The library, its walls lined with bookcases, features a sculptured mantelpiece resembling the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a>. The hooded chimneypiece represents the "dispersion of languages", with figures depicting Nimrod ruling over the elements of speech. Two trumpeters represent the pronouns, a queen embodies the verb, a porter the noun, and numerous other gilded and painted figures are displayed. The ceiling is divided into eight compartments, with depictions of the six founders of law and philosophy, Moses, St. Paul, Luther, Mahomet, Aristotle and Justinian. An illuminated alphabet frieze of architecture and the visual arts running around the bookcases completes the scheme, with the letters of the alphabet incorporated, including a letter "H" falling below the cornice. Due to <a href="Phonological%20history%20of%20English%20fricatives%20and%20affricates%23H-dropping">"H"-dropping</a> being a social taboo in Victorian times, Handley-Read described it as the "most celebrated of all Burges's jokes". Artists and craftsmen are featured at work on each lettered door of the bookcases that surround the room. In a panel in one of the glazed doors which open onto the garden, Burges is shown standing in front of a model of the Tower House. He features as Architect, the A forming the first letter of the alphabet frieze. Both the Architecture Cabinet and the Great Bookcase stood in this room. The stained glass windows in the room represent painting, architecture and sculpture, and were painted by Weekes.

On the wall opposite the library fireplace is an opening into the drawing room. Inside there are three stained glass windows which are set in ornamented marble linings. Opposite the windows stood the Zodiac Settle, which Burges moved from Buckingham Street. Love is the central decorative scheme to the room, with the ceiling painted with medieval <a href="cupid">cupid</a>s, and the walls covered with mythical lovers. Carved figures from the "<a href="Roman%20de%20la%20Rose">Roman de la Rose</a>" decorate the chimneypiece, which Crook considered "one of the most glorious that Burges and Nicholls ever produced". Echoing Crook, Charles Handley-Read wrote, "Working together, Burges and Nicholls had transposed a poem into sculpture with a delicacy that is very nearly musical. The "Roman de la Rose" has come to life."

The dining room is devoted to <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="The%20House%20of%20Fame">The House of Fame</a>" and the art of story-telling, Crook explaining that "tall stories are part of the dining room rite". The hooded chimneypiece, of Devonshire marble, contained a bronze figure above the fireplace representing the Goddess of Fame; its hands and face were made of ivory, with sapphires for eyes. It was later stolen. The tiles on the walls depict fairy stories, including "<a href="Reynard">Reynard the Fox</a>", "<a href="Jack%20and%20the%20Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Red%20Riding%20Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>". The room also shows Burges's innovative use of materials: Handley-Read observed that the Victorians had "a horror of food smells" and therefore the room was constructed using materials that did not absorb odours and could be washed. The walls are covered with Devonshire marble, surmounted by glazed picture tiles, while the ceiling is of sheet metal. The ceiling is divided into coffered compartments by square beams, and features symbols of the Sun, the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Burges designed most of the cutlery and plate used in this room, which display his skills as a designer of metalwork, including the claret jug and Cat Cup chosen by Lord and Lady Bute as mementos from Burges's collection after his death. The panels of the wine cupboard were decorated by <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>.

The windows of the stair turret represent <a href="Casket%20with%20Scenes%20of%20Romances%20%28Walters%2071264%29">"the Storming of the Castle of Love"</a>. On the first floor are two bedrooms and an armoury. Burges's bedroom, with a theme of sea creatures, overlooks the garden. Its elaborate ceiling is segmented into panels by gilded and painted beams, studded with miniature convex mirrors set in to gilt stars. Fish and eels swim in a frieze of waves painted under the ceiling, and fish are also carved in relief on the chimneypiece. On the fire-hood, a sculpted mermaid gazes into a looking-glass, with seashells, coral, seaweed and a baby mermaid also represented. Charles Handley-Read described the frieze around the Mermaid fireplace as "proto-<a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>" and noted "the debt of international art nouveau to Victorian Gothic designers, Burges included". In this room, Burges placed two of his most personal pieces of furniture, the Red Bed, in which he died, and the <a href="Narcissus%20washstand">Narcissus washstand</a>, both of which originally came from Buckingham Street. The bed is painted blood red and features a panel depicting "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>". The washstand is red and gold; its tip-up basin of marble inlaid with fishes is silver and gold.

"The Earth and its productions" is the theme of the guest room facing the street. Its ceiling is adorned with butterflies and <a href="fleurs-de-lis">fleurs-de-lis</a>, and at the crossing of the main beams is a convex mirror in a gilded surround. Along the length of the beams are paintings of frogs and mice. A frieze of flowers, once painted over, has since been restored. The Golden Bed and the Vita Nuova Washstand designed for this room are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Burges designated the final room on the first floor an armoury and used it to display his large collection of armour. The collection was bequeathed to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> upon his death. A carved chimneypiece in the armoury has three <a href="roundel">roundel</a>s carved with the goddesses <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>, <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> and <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a> in medieval attire.

The garret originally contained day and night nurseries, which the author James Stourton considers a surprising choice of arrangement for the "childless bachelor Burges". They contain a pair of decorated chimneypieces featuring the tale of "Jack and the Beanstalk" and three monkeys at play.

The garden at the rear of the house featured raised flowerbeds which Dakers described as being "planned according to those pleasances depicted in medieval romances; beds of scarlet tulips, bordered with stone fencing". On a mosaic terrace, around a statue of a boy holding a hawk, sculpted by Thomas Nicholls, Burges and his guests would sit on "marble seats or on Persian rugs and embroidered cushions." The garden, and that of the adjacent Woodland House, contain trees from the former Little Holland House.

In creating the interior of the house, Burges demonstrated his skill as a jeweller, metalworker and designer. He included some of his best pieces of furniture such as the Zodiac Settle, the Dog Cabinet and the Great Bookcase, the last of which Charles Handley-Read described as "occupying a unique position in the history of Victorian painted furniture". The fittings were as elaborate as the furniture: the tap for one of the guest washstands was in the form of a bronze bull from whose throat water poured into a sink inlaid with silver fish. Within the Tower House Burges placed some of his finest metalwork; the artist Henry Stacy Marks wrote, "he could design a chalice as well as a cathedral ... His decanters, cups, jugs, forks and spoons were designed with an equal ability to that with which he would design a castle."

Burges's furniture did not receive universal acclaim. In his major study of English domestic architecture, <a href="The%20English%20House">"Das Englische Haus"</a>, published some twenty years after Burges's death, <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a> wrote of The Tower House, "Worst of all, perhaps, is the furniture. Some of it is in the earlier manner, some of it box-like and painted all over. This style had now become fashionable, though with what historical justification it is not easy to say".

Many of the early pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were originally made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the <a href="1862%20International%20Exhibition">1862 International Exhibition</a>. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln and gave it to <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, "<a href="The%20Ordeal%20of%20Gilbert%20Pinfold">The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold</a>." Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.

Many of the decorative items Burges designed for the Tower House were dispersed following his death. Several pieces purchased by Charles Handley-Read, who was instrumental in reviving interest in Burges, were acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford. The museum also bought the Zodiac Settle from the Waugh family in 2011.

The table below lists the known pieces of furniture originally "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>", with their dates of construction and their current location where known.

Richard Popplewell Pullan described the house in detail in the second of two works he wrote about his brother-in-law, "The House of William Burges, A.R.A.", published in 1886. The book contains photographs of the interior of the house by <a href="Francis%20Bedford%20%28photographer%29">Francis Bedford</a>. In 1893, the building was the only private house to be recorded in an article in "The Builder", which gave an overview of the architecture of the previous fifty years. It was referenced again a decade latter by Muthesius, who described it as, "The most highly developed Gothic house to have been built in the 19th century (and) the last to be built in England". It was then largely ignored, James Stourton describing its early twentieth-century decline as "a paradigm of the reputation of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic Revival</a>".

A renewed understanding and appreciation of the building, and of Burges himself, began with Charles Handley-Read's essay on Burges in Peter Ferriday's collection "Victorian Architecture", published in 1963. In 1966 Handley-Read followed this with a substantial article on the house for "Country Life", "Aladdin's Palace in Kensington". His notes on Burges formed the basis of Mordaunt Crook's centenary volume, "William Burges and the High Victorian Dream", published in 1981 and revised and reissued in 2013, in which Crook wrote at length on both the Tower House and its contents.

More recent coverage was given in "London 3: North West", the revision to the "Buildings of England" guide to London written by <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> and Bridget Cherry, published in 1991 (revised 2002). The house is referenced in Matthew Williams's "William Burges" (2004), and in "Panoramas of Lost London" by Philip Davies, published in 2011, which includes some of Francis Bedford's photographs of the house from 1885. In a chapter on the building in "Great Houses of London" (2012), the author James Stourton called The Tower House "the most singular of London houses, even including the <a href="Sir%20John%20Soane%27s%20Museum">Soane Museum</a>."

Tahiti rail

The Tahiti rail, Tahitian red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail ("Gallirallus pacificus") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of <a href="Rallidae">rail</a> that lived on <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>. It was first recorded during <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second voyage</a> around the world (1772–1775), on which it was illustrated by <a href="Georg%20Forster">Georg Forster</a> and described by <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a>. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of <a href="Mehetia">Mehetia</a>. The Tahiti rail appears to have been closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the <a href="buff-banded%20rail">buff-banded rail</a>, and has also been historically confused with the <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>n subspecies of that bird.

The Tahiti rail was long, and its colouration was unusual for a rail. The underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> were white, and the upper parts were black with white dots and bands. The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless, and nested on the ground. It is said to have been seen in open areas, marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects and occasionally <a href="copra">copra</a> (coconut meat). The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. It appears to have become extinct some time after 1844 on Tahiti, and perhaps as late as the 1930s on Mehetia.

The Tahiti rail was found on the <a href="South%20Pacific%20island">South Pacific island</a> of <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> (part of the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a> <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>) by naturalists who were part of the British explorer <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second voyage</a> around the world (1772–1775). The bird was illustrated by <a href="Georg%20Forster">Georg Forster</a>, who accompanied his father, the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a>. The father and son were tasked with recording natural history during the voyage, with Georg as <a href="draughtsman">draughtsman</a>. The plate (no. 128) is life-sized, and is kept at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20in%20London">Natural History Museum in London</a>. It is inscribed with the words "Rallus pacificus. Taheitee. Oomnaoe. Oomeea keto ōw'". No specimens of this bird have been preserved, but it is presumed that Forster saw a skin. The English naturalist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> referred to this species as the "Pacific Rail" in 1785, and the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> formally named the bird "Rallus pacificus" in 1789, based on Latham's account. In 1844 the German naturalist <a href="Hinrich%20Lichtenstein">Hinrich Lichtenstein</a> published J.R. Forster's account of the discoveries made during the journey, including his description of the Tahiti rail.

J.R. Forster indicated that the Tahiti rail was called "Oomnaa" or "Eboonàa" on Tahiti and neighbouring islands, and "Oomèia-Keteòw" on <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, though he specified only Tahiti and nearby islands as being part of its range. "Tevea" also appears to have been one of the common names for the bird. In 1967 the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> wrote that the bird was said by <a href="Polynesians">Polynesians</a> to have also existed on the island of <a href="Mehetia">Mehetia</a> near Tahiti "a generation ago", as reported to Greenway by the amateur naturalist Anthony Curtiss. Greenway also suggested it may have occurred on other islands. In 1972 the ornithologist Phillip L. Bruner stated the bird was last recorded on Mehetia about fifty years earlier. In 2012 the English ornithologist and artist <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> referred to the claim that the bird lived on Mehetia as "hearsay", but regarded it a possibility that it lived there and on other outlying islands. In 2001 the English writer <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a> stated that unlike some other "<a href="hypothetical%20extinct%20species">hypothetical extinct species</a>" only known from old accounts, the Tahiti rail was sufficiently well documented for there to be no doubt that it existed.

The Tahiti rail has historically been confused with the extant Tongan subspecies of the <a href="buff-banded%20rail">buff-banded rail</a>, "Gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus", which was also illustrated and described by the Forsters. In his 1783 description of the Tongan bird (wherein it was named "Rallus eucaudata"), the English ornithologist <a href="John%20Frederick%20Miller">John Frederick Miller</a> erroneously gave its locality as Tahiti, which led the Tahiti rail to be regarded as a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of the extant bird. He based his description on Forster's illustration (plate no.127) of the Tongan bird, and Latham and Gmelin later repeated Miller's erroneous locality. The 1844 publication of Forster's description listed the Tongan bird as a variety of the Tahitian species, and similar schemes were suggested by later writers until 1953, when the New Zealand biologist <a href="Averil%20Margaret%20Lysaght">Averil Margaret Lysaght</a> pointed out Miller's locality mistake, which had been overlooked until that point, and kept the two birds separate. In spite of the clarification, the Tongan bird was placed on a list of extinct birds in the 1981 book "Endangered Birds of the World", and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was used to illustrate the <a href="Samoan%20wood%20rail">Samoan wood rail</a> ("Gallinula pacifica"), a completely different species, in the 1989 book "Le Grand Livre des Espécies Disparues".

Along with the buff-banded rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail has been placed in either the genus "<a href="Gallirallus">Gallirallus</a>" or the genus "Hypotaenidia"; the latter is considered a synonym of the former by some authorities. The specific name "pacificus" refers to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "peaceful". The genus name "Gallirallus" is a combination of the genus names "<a href="junglefowl">Gallus</a>" and "<a href="Rallus">Rallus</a>". In 1977 the American ornithologist <a href="Sidney%20Dillon%20Ripley">Sidney Dillon Ripley</a> suggested that the Tahiti rail was an isolated form of buff-banded rail, and perhaps belonged to a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with that bird and the <a href="Wake%20Island%20rail">Wake Island rail</a> ("Gallirallus wakensis"). Rails are some of the most widespread terrestrial <a href="vertebrates">vertebrates</a>, and have colonised practically all island groups, with many island species being <a href="flightless">flightless</a>. In 1973 the American ornithologist <a href="Storrs%20L.%20Olson">Storrs L. Olson</a> argued that many insular flightless species of rails were descended from still extant flighted rails, that flightlessness had <a href="Convergent%20evolution">evolved independently</a> and rapidly in many different island species, and that this feature is therefore of no taxonomic importance. Flightlessness can be advantageous (especially where food is scarce) because it conserves energy by decreasing the mass of flight muscles; the absence of predators (particularly <a href="mammalian">mammalian</a>) and a reduced need for dispersal are factors that allow this feature to develop in island birds.

J.R. Forster stated the Tahiti rail was long, which is small for a species of "Gallirallus". Its colouration was also striking and unusual for a rail, and it was described as being an attractive bird. The upper parts were black with white dots and bands (also referred to as spots and bars), and the underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> were white. The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. The sexes were presumably similar, and the immature and juvenile were not described.

Forster's original description of the bird follows below, in a translation from Latin published by the English naturalist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> in 1907:

Forster also stated that the total length to the middle toe was long, the bill was long, the <a href="tibiae">tibiae</a> (shinbones) long, and the middle toe long. The Tahiti rail was similar to the buff-banded rail in the pattern of the nape and supercilium, and its spots and bars, but was otherwise generally distinct from other "Gallirallus" species.

Forster's plate (which Fuller described as "rather crude" yet "explicit") became the basis for other depictions of the bird, by artists such as <a href="John%20Gerrard%20Keulemans">John Gerrard Keulemans</a> (1907), <a href="Fenwick%20Lansdowne">Fenwick Lansdowne</a> (1977), and Hume (2012). Keulemans' illustration was made for the 1907 book "<a href="Extinct%20Birds%20%28book%29">Extinct Birds</a>" (before Forster's original had been published) by Rothschild, who pointed out that the legs had been painted too brightly red in the new adaptation, when they should instead have been flesh-coloured. Keulemans also depicted bars on the tail covert feathers not shown in the original, according to Ripley.

The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless, and nested on the ground. Its social behaviour is unknown. Bruner claimed to have gained information about the behaviour of the species from "the few people who still remember the bird". According to Bruner, the <a href="Bird%20vocalization">call</a> of the bird was described as similar to that of other rails, though it differed in ending in a high-pitched whistle. It was said to have been seen in open areas, sometimes with other rails in marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on <a href="copra">copra</a> (coconut meat). Its broken colour pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked "shyness".

The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. The small, outlying islands off Tahiti also have rats, though there were no cats on Mehetia at the time of Greenway's writing in 1967. According to Bruner, the bird was said to have been common on Tahiti until the end of the 19th century, beginning to decline thereafter; it had disappeared from there sometime after 1844. It may have survived on the smaller, uninhabited island of Mehetia until the 1930s, perhaps due to the absence of cats. This later date is accepted by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Other extinct Tahitian birds include the <a href="Tahiti%20sandpiper">Tahiti sandpiper</a> and the <a href="black-fronted%20parakeet">black-fronted parakeet</a>, and some species have disappeared from Tahiti itself but survive on other islands. According to Olson, it is possible that hundreds of rail populations have become extinct from islands following the arrival of humans within the past 1500 years.

Mauritius blue pigeon

The Mauritius blue pigeon ("Alectroenas nitidissimus") is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="blue%20pigeon">blue pigeon</a> formerly <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> east of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It has two extinct relatives from the Mascarenes and three extant ones from other islands. It is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> of blue pigeons, "Alectroenas".

It had white <a href="hackles">hackles</a> around the head, neck and breast and blue plumage on the body, and it was red on the tail and the bare parts of the head. These colours were thought similar to those of the <a href="Dutch%20flag">Dutch flag</a>, a resemblance reflected in some of the bird's names. The males had red foreheads, and the juveniles may have been partially green. It was 30 cm (12 in) long and larger and more robust than any other blue pigeon species. It could raise its hackles into a <a href="Ruff%20%28clothing%29">ruff</a>, which it used for display. Its call sounded like "barf barf" and it also made a cooing noise. It fed on fruits, nuts, and <a href="molluscs">molluscs</a>, and was once widespread in the forests of Mauritius.

The bird was first mentioned in the 17th century and was described several times thereafter, but very few accounts describe the behaviour of living specimens. Several stuffed and at least one live specimen reached Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Only three stuffed specimens exist today, and only one bird was ever depicted when alive. The species is thought to have become extinct in the 1830s due to <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> and predation.

The first record of the Mauritius blue pigeon is two sketches in the 1601–1603 journal of the Dutch ship "Gelderland". The birds appear to have been freshly killed or stunned. The drawings were made by the Dutch artist Joris Joostensz Laerle on <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, but were not published until 1969. François Cauche in 1651 briefly mentions "white, black and red turtle doves", encountered in 1638, which is thought to be the first unequivocal mention of the bird. The next account is that of <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Charpentier%20de%20Cossigny">Jean-François Charpentier de Cossigny</a> in the mid-18th century.

The French naturalist <a href="Pierre%20Sonnerat">Pierre Sonnerat</a> described the bird in 1782, calling it "Pigeon Hollandais" (Dutch pigeon), a French <a href="vernacular%20name">vernacular name</a> that derives from its red, white, and blue colouration, which reminded him of the <a href="Dutch%20flag">Dutch flag</a> (the French flag did not yet have these colours). He had collected two specimens during a voyage in 1774. These <a href="syntype">syntype</a> specimens were deposited in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27Histoire%20naturelle">Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle</a> in Paris. By 1893, only one of them, specimen MNHN n°C.G. 2000-727, still existed, and had been damaged by <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a> in an attempt at <a href="fumigation">fumigation</a>. Since Sonnerat named and described them in French, the <a href="scientific%20naming">scientific naming</a> of the bird was left to the Tyrolean naturalist <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a>, who did not observe a specimen himself, but <a href="latinised">latinised</a> Sonnerat's description in 1786. He named the bird "Columba nitidissima", which means "most brilliant pigeon".

When German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> redescribed the bird with the species name "franciae" ("of France") in 1789, he referred to the French <a href="Flag%20of%20France">tricolour</a> which had just been flown for the first time. <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Bonnaterre">Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre</a> used the name "batavica" ("the Dutch one") in his description in 1790. In 1840 the English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> named a new <a href="genus">genus</a>, "<a href="Alectroenas">Alectroenas</a>", for the Mauritius blue pigeon; "alektruon" in Greek means <a href="domestic%20cock">domestic cock</a>, and "oinas" means <a href="dove">dove</a>. "Alectroenas nitidissima" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus, which includes all blue pigeons. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> was emended from "A. nitidissimus" to "A. nitidissima" by the <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a> in 2012.

Another skin arrived at the Paris museum in 1800, collected by Colonel M. Mathieu for the French ornithologist <a href="Louis%20Dufresne">Louis Dufresne</a>. It was sold in 1819 among other items, was sent to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, and is now in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Scotland">National Museum of Scotland</a> as specimen MU No. 624. It was not identified as a Mauritius blue pigeon until the British ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> saw it in 1879. The last specimen recorded was shot in <a href="Savanne">Savanne</a> in 1826 and given to <a href="Julien%20Desjardins">Julien Desjardins</a>, founder of the <a href="Mauritius%20Natural%20History%20Museum">Mauritius Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="Port%20Louis">Port Louis</a>, where it is still located, though in poor condition. Only these three <a href="taxidermic">taxidermic</a> specimens still exist. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains of the Mauritius blue pigeon were collected in the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> <a href="swamp">swamp</a> by Théodore Sauzier in 1889. More were collected by Etienne Thirioux around 1900. They are thought to have been found near <a href="Le%20Pouce">Le Pouce</a> mountain and <a href="Plaine%20des%20Roches">Plaine des Roches</a>.

"Alectroenas" blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in the western <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. They are <a href="allopatric">allopatric</a> and can therefore be regarded as a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>. There are three extant species: the <a href="Madagascar%20blue%20pigeon">Madagascar blue pigeon</a> ("A. madagascariensis"), the <a href="Comoros%20blue%20pigeon">Comoros blue pigeon</a> ("A. sganzini"), and the <a href="Seychelles%20blue%20pigeon">Seychelles blue pigeon</a> ("A. pulcherrima"). The three <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> islands were each home to a species, all of which are extinct: the Mauritius blue pigeon, the <a href="Rodrigues%20blue%20pigeon">Rodrigues blue pigeon</a> ("A. payandeei"), and the Réunion blue pigeon ("A." sp.). Compared with other pigeons, the blue pigeons are medium to large, stocky, and have longer wings and tails. All the species have distinct mobile <a href="hackles">hackles</a> on the head and neck. The <a href="tibiotarsus">tibiotarsus</a> is comparatively long and the <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a> short. The blue pigeons may have colonised the Mascarenes, the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> or a now submerged <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a> by "island hopping". They may have evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Their closest <a href="genetics">genetic</a> relative is the <a href="cloven-feathered%20dove">cloven-feathered dove</a> of <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> ("Drepanoptila holosericea"), from which they separated 8–9 million years ago. Their ancestral group appears to be the <a href="fruit%20doves">fruit doves</a> ("Ptilinopus") of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>.

The feathers on the head, neck and breast of the Mauritius blue pigeon were silvery white, long, stiffened and pointed, especially around the neck. A patch of bright red, naked skin surrounded the eyes, and extended across the cheeks to the beak, which was greenish with a dark tip. The plumage of the body was <a href="indigo">indigo</a>, and the back, <a href="scapular%20feathers">scapular feathers</a> and wings were metallic blue. The base of the outer <a href="rectrices">rectrices</a> was partially blackish blue. The tail feathers and tail <a href="coverts">coverts</a> were <a href="maroon%20%28color%29">maroon</a>. The legs were dark <a href="slate-grey">slate-grey</a>. The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring. The bird was 30 cm (12 in) in length, the wings were 208 mm (8.2 in), the tail was 132 mm (5.2 in), the <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> was 25 mm (1 in), and the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsals</a> were 28 mm (1.10 in). It was the largest and most robust member of its genus, and the hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons.
Unlike the three surviving skins of Mauritius blue pigeons, one of two illustrations (the other is in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a>) of a live individual kept in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> around 1790 shows a red forehead. Both sexes of the Seychelles blue pigeon also have red foreheads, and the English palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> has suggested that the image depicts a male, which was described as "infinitely more handsome" than the female by Cossigny in the mid-18th century. Hume therefore interprets the three surviving skins as belonging to female specimens. A Mauritian woman recalling observations of Mauritius blue pigeons around 1815 mentioned green as one of its colours. Juvenile Seychelles and Comoro blue pigeons have green feathers, so this may also have been the case for juvenile Mauritian pigeons.

Some depictions and descriptions have shown the legs of Mauritius blue pigeons as red, like those of the Madagascar blue pigeon. The legs of the Paris specimen were painted red when the original colour faded, presumably on the basis of such accounts. The legs of the two other surviving specimens have not been painted and have faded to a yellowish brown. This feature is not mentioned in contemporary accounts, and such depictions are thought to be erroneous. Some modern restorations of the bird have also depicted it with facial <a href="crenulation">crenulation</a>s, like those of the Seychelles blue pigeon. This feature was unknown from contemporary accounts, until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015, where he mentioned the bird's "warty face".

Few descriptions of the behaviour of Mauritius blue pigeons are known; unpublished notes by Desjardins are now lost. An individual was brought to the Netherlands around 1790, where it survived in the <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a> of <a href="William%20V%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">William V, Prince of Orange</a> for three months before dying of <a href="oedema">oedema</a>. The only two known life drawings of the species (by G. Haasbroek) depict this individual. The illustrations show a <a href="displaying">displaying</a> male raising its hackles into a <a href="ruff">ruff</a>. This is a characteristic behaviour of other blue pigeons, too, and they can also vibrate their hackles. The following description of the display behaviour and <a href="Bird%20call">call</a>s of this individual was written on the back on the coloured drawing by Arnout Vosmaer, director of the menagerie:
The Mauritius blue pigeon probably lived in pairs or small groups in humid, mountainous <a href="evergreen%20forest">evergreen forest</a>s, like their extant relatives. Subfossil remains have been found in mid-west, mid-east and south-east Mauritius, indicating that the bird was once widespread. By 1812, the French naturalist <a href="Jacques%20G%C3%A9rard%20Milbert">Jacques Gérard Milbert</a> stated that solitary individuals were found in river valleys. They probably became rarer during French rule in Mauritius (1715–1810), as lowland areas of the island were almost completely <a href="deforested">deforested</a> during this time.

Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man, so the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, forests covered Mauritius entirely, but very little remains today because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The Mauritius blue pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the <a href="dodo">dodo</a>, the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a>, the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20owl">Mauritius owl</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20coot">Mascarene coot</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20shelduck">Mauritian shelduck</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20duck">Mauritian duck</a> and the <a href="Mauritius%20night%20heron">Mauritius night heron</a>. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the <a href="saddle-backed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="domed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">domed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20giant%20skink">Mauritian giant skink</a> and the <a href="Round%20Island%20burrowing%20boa">Round Island burrowing boa</a>. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as "<a href="Casearia%20tinifolia">Casearia tinifolia</a>" and the <a href="palm%20orchid">palm orchid</a>, have also become extinct.

Fruits and nuts were probably the mainstay of the Mauritius blue pigeon's diet, and like other blue pigeons, it may have occupied the upper <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, and migrated seasonally to where food was available. Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid-18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to the French scientist <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Antoine%20Ferchault%20de%20R%C3%A9aumur">René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur</a> with a letter describing his findings. The <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> and <a href="crop">crop</a> contained four "nuts", which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either "<a href="Calophyllum%20tacamahaca">Calophyllum tacamahaca</a>" or "<a href="Labourdonnaisia%20calophylloides">Labourdonnaisia calophylloides</a>". The Comoro and Seychelles blue pigeons also feed on "C. tacamahaca", and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds. In 1812 Jacques Gérard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild:
The claim that the bird fed on river <a href="molluscs">molluscs</a> was criticised by the French zoologists <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> and <a href="Emile%20Oustalet">Emile Oustalet</a> in 1893, with the later agreement of the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> in 1967, as blue pigeons are principally <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>. It has since been pointed out that other mainly <a href="frugivorous">frugivorous</a> pigeons, such as species of "Ptilinopus" and "<a href="Gallicolumba">Gallicolumba</a>", do occasionally eat molluscs and other <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>. The two species of "<a href="Nesoenas">Nesoenas</a>" have also been reported as eating <a href="freshwater%20snails">freshwater snails</a>, and one was seen hunting tadpoles. Milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails, as extant blue pigeons rarely land on the ground. A diet of snails would have provided the birds with calcium for egg production. Pretorius attempted to keep juvenile and adult Mauritius blue pigeons in captivity, but all his specimens died. This is probably because the species was almost exclusively frugivorous, like extant blue pigeons.

The Mauritius blue pigeon coexisted with humans for 200 years. Its decline can be correlated with deforestation, which is also the main threat to extant blue pigeons. Little lowland forest was left on the island by 1859. Frugivorous birds often need a large area for foraging and move between forest types to feed on different types of food, which grow irregularly. Other blue pigeons perch on bare branches, making them vulnerable to hunters.

Cossigny noted that the bird had become rare by 1755, but were common 23 years before, and attributed the decline to deforestation and hunting by escaped slaves. On the other hand, the French naturalist <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Bonnaterre">Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre</a> stated they were still common in 1790. The Mauritius blue pigeon was not seasonally poisonous like the <a href="pink%20pigeon">pink pigeon</a>, which still survives on Mauritius today, but it was reputed to be. In spite of this, it was hunted for food, and some early accounts praised the flavour of the bird. Extant blue pigeons are also considered good food, and are heavily hunted as a result, and it appears another population of them was hunted to extinction from the <a href="Farquhar%20Atoll">Farquhar</a> and <a href="Providence%20Atoll">Providence</a> islands. The Mauritius blue pigeon was easy to catch due to <a href="island%20tameness">island tameness</a>.
The last confirmed specimen was shot in the Savanne district in 1826, but the 1832 report by Desjardins suggests that some could still be found in remote forests in the centre of the island. Convinced that the pigeon still survived, the British ornithologist <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a> interviewed two inhabitants of Mauritius about the Mauritius blue pigeon in 1863, and these accounts suggest that the bird survived until at least 1837. The first interviewee claimed he had killed two specimens when the British <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="James%20Simpson%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">James Simpson</a> stayed on the island, which was 1826–37. The second was a woman who had last seen a bird around this time, and recalled hunts of it in approximately 1815, in a swampy area near <a href="Black%20River%20Gorges">Black River Gorges</a>, south western Mauritius:
It can be concluded that the Mauritius blue pigeon became extinct in the 1830s. Apart from habitat destruction and hunting, introduced predators, mainly <a href="crab-eating%20macaque">crab-eating macaque</a>s, were probably also responsible.

Problem of religious language

The problem of religious language considers whether it is possible to talk about <a href="God">God</a> meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as <a href="Apophatic%20theology">via negativa</a>, analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The "via negativa" is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise <a href="ineffability">ineffable</a> experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume's</a> requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the <a href="logical%20positivism">logical positivist</a> movement, particularly the philosopher <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically – with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher <a href="Antony%20Flew">Antony Flew</a> proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of <a href="language-games">games</a> – most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein – has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. <a href="R.%20M.%20Hare">R. M. Hare</a> used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks" – unfalsifiable <a href="belief-in">belief</a>s according to which a worldview is established – which are not necessarily meaningless. <a href="Basil%20Mitchell%20%28academic%29">Basil Mitchell</a> used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. <a href="John%20Hick">John Hick</a> used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of <a href="eschatological%20verification">eschatological verification</a>, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher <a href="Simone%20Weil">Simone Weil</a> expressed this problem in her work "Waiting for God", in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.

The medieval doctrine of <a href="divine%20simplicity">divine simplicity</a> also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no <a href="Accident%20%28philosophy%29">accidental properties</a> – these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.

The theologian <a href="Sallie%20McFague">Sallie McFague</a> believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased <a href="secularism">secularisation</a> of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both <a href="idolatry">idolatrous</a> because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.

<a href="Jewish%20philosophy">Jewish philosopher</a> <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God. Maimonides believed that God is <a href="divine%20simplicity">simple</a> and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes. He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality". Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.

<a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly <a href="univocity">univocal</a> (has only one meaning) and partly <a href="Equivocation">equivocal</a> (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.

Philosopher <a href="Taede%20A.%20Smedes">Taede Smedes</a> argued that religious language is symbolic. Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God "pro nobis" (for us) and not "in se" (as such) or "sine nobis" (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.

In the twentieth century, <a href="Ian%20Ramsey">Ian Ramsey</a> developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by <a href="Alister%20McGrath">Alister McGrath</a>. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.

Philosopher <a href="Paul%20Tillich">Paul Tillich</a> argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.

<a href="Louis%20Dupr%C3%A9%20%28philosopher%29">Louis Dupré</a> differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign. Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived. Dupré differentiates between religious and <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a> symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.

<a href="Langdon%20Brown%20Gilkey">Langdon Brown Gilkey</a> explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.

In the <a href="Sikhism">Sikh</a> religious text the <a href="Guru%20Granth%20Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a>, religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the <a href="religious%20experience">experiences</a> they have while <a href="meditation">meditating</a> are <a href="ineffability">ineffable</a>, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous – this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised. To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.

William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "<a href="Folklore">folktale</a>s". Using the example of <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a>s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.

<a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> theologian <a href="Rudolf%20Bultmann">Rudolf Bultmann</a> proposed that the Bible contains <a href="existentialism">existential</a> content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with <a href="Naturalism%20%28philosophy%29">naturalism</a>. He offered a demythologised <a href="Christology">Christology</a>, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a> was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick believed that demythologising the <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">incarnation</a> would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.

Islamic philosopher <a href="Carl%20Ernst">Carl Ernst</a> has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.

Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making truth-claims; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals. He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses "performative", as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves – Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function. Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative. The philosopher <a href="J.%20L.%20Austin">J. L. Austin</a> argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children. He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about. Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.

British philosopher <a href="R.%20B.%20Braithwaite">R. B. Braithwaite</a> attempted to approach religious language <a href="empiricism">empirically</a> and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use". He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and <a href="parable">parable</a>s.

Professor <a href="Nathan%20Katz%20%28professor%29">Nathan Katz</a> writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> in the <a href="Lotus%20Sutra">Lotus Sutra</a>, which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.

In the conclusion of his "<a href="Enquiry%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</a>", Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.

Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.

The <a href="logical%20positivism">logical positivism</a> movement originated in the <a href="Vienna%20Circle">Vienna Circle</a> and was continued by British philosopher <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>. The Vienna Circle adopted the <a href="analytic-synthetic%20distinction">distinction between analytic and synthetic statements</a>: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a <a href="verifiability%20theory%20of%20meaning">verifiability theory of meaning</a>, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.

In 1936, Ayer wrote "<a href="Language%2C%20Truth%20and%20Logic">Language, Truth and Logic</a>", in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be <a href="logical%20truth">necessarily true</a>, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God – theistic, atheistic and agnostic – arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his "<a href="Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>" with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the "mystical", which cannot be described, as important. Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.

The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is <a href="unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a> because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, <a href="Analytic%20philosophy">analytic</a> philosopher <a href="Antony%20Flew">Antony Flew</a> argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.

Using <a href="John%20Wisdom">John Wisdom</a>'s <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Invisible%20Gardener">parable of the invisible gardener</a>, Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected. Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful. Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless. Drawing specifically on the emerging science of <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular genetics</a> (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified; "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of <a href="abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a> to get the job done."

The analogy of a game was first proposed by <a href="Hans-Georg%20Gadamer">Hans-Georg Gadamer</a> in an attempt to demonstrate the <a href="epistemology">epistemic</a> unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> teaches this to be the <a href="logos%20%28Christianity%29">divine word</a> which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative <a href="language-game">language-game</a> analogy. He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language. Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context. Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".

Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional – a confession of what someone feels and believes – rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.

<a href="Dewi%20Zephaniah%20Phillips">Dewi Zephaniah Phillips</a> defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the <a href="apologetics">apologetics</a> of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.

In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher <a href="R.%20M.%20Hare">R. M. Hare</a> told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people – religious and non-religious – hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical evidence</a>. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world. Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.

Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.

Responding to the verification principle, <a href="John%20Hick">John Hick</a> used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of <a href="eschatological%20verificationism">eschatological verificationism</a>. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death. Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in <a href="religious%20pluralism">religious pluralism</a>. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in <a href="bodily%20resurrection">bodily resurrection</a> can still be verified.
