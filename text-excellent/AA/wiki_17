Cabbage

Cabbage or headed cabbage (comprising several <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s of "<a href="Brassica%20oleracea">Brassica oleracea</a>") is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) <a href="biennial%20plant">biennial plant</a> grown as an <a href="annual%20plant">annual</a> vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage, <a href="Brassica%20oleracea">"B. oleracea" var. "oleracea"</a>, and belongs to the "<a href="cole%20crops">cole crops</a>", meaning it is closely related to <a href="broccoli">broccoli</a> and <a href="cauliflower">cauliflower</a> (var. "botrytis"); <a href="Brussels%20sprouts">Brussels sprouts</a> (var. "gemmifera"); and <a href="savoy%20cabbage">savoy cabbage</a> (var. "sabauda"). "<a href="Brassica%20rapa">Brassica rapa</a>" is commonly named Chinese, celery or napa cabbage and has many of the same uses. Cabbage is high in nutritional value.

Cabbage heads generally range from , and can be green, purple or white. Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common. Smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors are rarer. It is a multi-layered vegetable. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. , the heaviest cabbage was . 

Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD. By the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, cabbage had become a prominent part of <a href="European%20cuisine">European cuisine</a>. Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other <a href="cole%20crops">cole crops</a> to prevent <a href="cross-pollination">cross-pollination</a>. Cabbage is prone to several <a href="micronutrient%20deficiency">nutrient deficiencies</a>, as well as to multiple <a href="Pest%20%28agriculture%29">pests</a>, and bacterial and fungal diseases.

Cabbages are prepared many different ways for eating; they can be <a href="pickling">pickled</a>, <a href="fermented">fermented</a> (for dishes such as <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>), <a href="steaming">steamed</a>, <a href="stewing">stewed</a>, <a href="Saut%C3%A9ing">sautéed</a>, <a href="braising">braised</a>, or eaten <a href="Raw%20food">raw</a>. Cabbage is a good source of <a href="vitamin%20K">vitamin K</a>, <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> and <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a>. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</a> reported that world production of cabbage and other <a href="brassica">brassica</a>s for 2014 was 71.8 million metric <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s, with China accounting for 47% of the world total.

Cabbage ("Brassica oleracea" or "B. oleracea" var. "capitata", var. "tuba", var. "sabauda" or var. "acephala") is a member of the genus "<a href="Brassica">Brassica</a>" and the mustard family, <a href="Brassicaceae">Brassicaceae</a>. Several other <a href="cruciferous%20vegetables">cruciferous vegetables</a> (sometimes known as "cole crops") are considered <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s of "B. oleracea", including <a href="broccoli">broccoli</a>, <a href="collard%20greens">collard greens</a>, <a href="brussels%20sprouts">brussels sprouts</a>, <a href="kohlrabi">kohlrabi</a> and <a href="sprouting%20broccoli">sprouting broccoli</a>. All of these developed from the wild cabbage "B. oleracea" var. "oleracea", also called <a href="colewort">colewort</a> or field cabbage. This original species <a href="evolved">evolved</a> over thousands of years into those seen today, as <a href="Selective%20breeding">selection</a> resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.

The varietal <a href="botanical%20name">epithet</a> "capitata" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for "having a head". "B. oleracea" and its derivatives have hundreds of <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s throughout the world.

"Cabbage" was originally used to refer to multiple forms of "B. oleracea", including those with loose or non-existent heads. A related species, "<a href="Brassica%20rapa">Brassica rapa</a>", is commonly named Chinese, napa or celery cabbage, and has many of the same uses. It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species. These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree (a member of the genus "<a href="Andira">Andira</a>") and cabbage palms, which include several genera of <a href="palm%20tree">palms</a> such as "<a href="Mauritia">Mauritia</a>", "<a href="Roystonea%20oleracea">Roystonea oleracea</a>", "<a href="Acrocomia">Acrocomia</a>" and "<a href="Euterpe%20oenocarpus">Euterpe oenocarpus</a>".

The original family name of brassicas was "Cruciferae", which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>. The word "brassica" derives from "bresic", a <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic</a> word for cabbage. Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the <a href="Proto-Slavic%20borrowings">Celto-Slavic</a> root "cap" or "kap", meaning "head". The <a href="late%20Middle%20English">late Middle English</a> word "cabbage" derives from the word "caboche" ("head"), from the <a href="Picard%20language">Picard dialect</a> of <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a>. This in turn is a variant of the Old French "caboce". Through the centuries, "cabbage" and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items, occupations and activities. <a href="Cash">Cash</a> and <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> have both been described by the slang "cabbage", while "cabbage-head" means a fool or stupid person and "cabbaged" means to be exhausted or, vulgarly, in a <a href="vegetative%20state">vegetative state</a>.

Cabbage <a href="seedling">seedling</a>s have a thin <a href="taproot">taproot</a> and cordate (heart-shaped) <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>. The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>. Plants are tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and tall when flowering in the second year. Heads average between , with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads. Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a <a href="epicuticular%20wax">waxy bloom</a> on the leaves. Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow. About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper of soil; some <a href="lateral%20root">lateral root</a>s can penetrate up to deep.

The <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> is an unbranched and <a href="indeterminate%20growth">indeterminate</a> terminal <a href="raceme">raceme</a> measuring tall, with flowers that are yellow or white. Each flower has four <a href="petal">petal</a>s set in a perpendicular pattern, as well as four <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s, six <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s, and a <a href="superior%20ovary">superior ovary</a> that is two-celled and contains a single <a href="stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> and <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a>. Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments. The fruit is a <a href="silique">silique</a> that opens at maturity through <a href="Dehiscence%20%28botany%29">dehiscence</a> to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. <a href="Self-pollination">Self-pollination</a> is impossible, and plants are <a href="cross-pollinated">cross-pollinated</a> by insects. The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring by ; after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward.

Many shapes, colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage. Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled-leaf, loose-head savoys and smooth-leaf firm-head cabbages, while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples. Oblate, round and pointed shapes are found.

Cabbage has been <a href="selective%20breeding">selectively bred</a> for head weight and <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. <a href="Plant%20breeding">Breeding</a> objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the <a href="Genetically%20modified%20food">genetic modification</a> of "B. oleracea" crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and <a href="pesticide%20resistance">herbicide</a> resistance.

Although cabbage has an extensive history, it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as "brassicas". The wild ancestor of cabbage, "<a href="Brassica%20oleracea">Brassica oleracea</a>", originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves. According to the <a href="triangle%20of%20U">triangle of U</a> theory of the evolution and relationships between "Brassica" species, "B. oleracea" and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.

Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>ern crops such as <a href="lentil">lentil</a>s and <a href="wheat">summer wheat</a>. Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild "B. oleracea", multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, perhaps by the <a href="Celts">Celts</a> of central and western Europe. Recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a Mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas.

Unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> garden repertory.

It is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage, which is not native to the Nile valley, though a word "shaw't" in <a href="Papyrus%20Harris">Papyrus Harris</a> of the time of <a href="Ramesses%20III">Ramesses III</a>, has been interpreted as "cabbage". <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>ians knew the <a href="cole%20crops">cole crops</a> as "gramb", under the influence of Greek "krambe", which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies. By early Roman times, Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s among a wide variety of other vegetables and <a href="pulses">pulses</a>.

The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage, as mentioned by <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, although whether they were more closely related to today's cabbage or to one of the other "Brassica" crops is unknown. The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as "krambe" and to the Romans as "brassica" or "olus"; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as "raphanos" and in Latin as "caulis".

<a href="Chrysippus%20of%20Cnidos">Chrysippus of Cnidos</a> wrote a treatise on cabbage, which Pliny knew, but it has not survived. The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and <a href="grapevine">grapevine</a>s were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.

"Brassica" was considered by some Romans a table luxury, although <a href="Lucullus">Lucullus</a> considered it unfit for the senatorial table. The more traditionalist <a href="Cato%20the%20Elder">Cato the Elder</a>, espousing a simple Republican life, ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave directions for its medicinal use, which extended to the cabbage-eater's urine, in which infants might be rinsed. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> listed seven varieties, including <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> cabbage, <a href="Cumae">Cumae</a> cabbage and <a href="Sabellians">Sabellian</a> cabbage. According to Pliny, the Pompeii cabbage, which could not stand cold, is "taller, and has a thick stock near the root, but grows thicker between the leaves, these being scantier and narrower, but their tenderness is a valuable quality". The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by <a href="Columella">Columella</a> in <a href="Columella%23De%20Re%20Rustica">"De Re Rustica"</a>. <a href="Apicius">Apicius</a> gives several recipes for "cauliculi", tender cabbage shoots. The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from <a href="gout">gout</a>, headaches and the symptoms of <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous mushroom</a> ingestion. The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would enable one to avoid drunkenness. Cabbage continued to figure in the "<a href="materia%20medica">materia medica</a>" of antiquity as well as at table: in the first century AD <a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> mentions two kinds of coleworts with medical uses, the cultivated and the wild, and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in <a href="herbals">herbals</a> right through the 17th century.

At the end of Antiquity cabbage is mentioned in "De observatione ciborum" ("On the Observance of Foods") of <a href="Anthimus%20%28physician%29">Anthimus</a>, a Greek doctor at the court of <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a>, and cabbage appears among vegetables directed to be cultivated in the "<a href="Capitulare%20de%20villis">Capitulare de villis</a>", composed c. 771-800 that guided the governance of the royal estates of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>.

In Britain, the Anglo-Saxons cultivated "cawel". When round-headed cabbages appeared in 14th-century England they were called "cabaches" and "caboches", words drawn from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> and applied at first to refer to the ball of unopened leaves, the contemporaneous recipe that commences "Take cabbages and quarter them, and seethe them in good broth", also suggests the tightly headed cabbage.
<a href="Manuscript%20illumination">Manuscript illumination</a>s show the prominence of cabbage in the cuisine of the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, and cabbage seeds feature among the seed list of purchases for the use of <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">King John II of France</a> when captive in England in 1360, but cabbages were also a familiar staple of the poor: in the lean year of 1420 the "Bourgeois of Paris" noted that "poor people ate no bread, nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes, without any bread or salt". French naturalist <a href="Jean%20Ruel">Jean Ruel</a> made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise "De Natura Stirpium", referring to it as "capucos coles" ("head-coles"). <a href="Sir%20Anthony%20Ashley%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet</a>, did not disdain to have a cabbage at the foot of his monument in <a href="Wimborne%20St%20Giles">Wimborne St Giles</a>.

In Istanbul, Sultan <a href="Selim%20III">Selim III</a> penned a tongue-in-cheek ode to cabbage: without cabbage, the halva feast was not complete. Cabbages spread from Europe into <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> as a winter vegetable, and later followed <a href="trade%20routes">trade routes</a> throughout Asia and the Americas. The absence of <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> or other ancient Eastern language names for cabbage suggests that it was introduced to South Asia relatively recently. In India, cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from Portugal, who established trade routes from the 14th to 17th centuries. <a href="Carl%20Peter%20Thunberg">Carl Peter Thunberg</a> reported that cabbage was not yet known in Japan in 1775.

Many cabbage varieties—including some still commonly grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the <a href="savoy%20cabbage">savoy cabbage</a>. During the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was a food <a href="staple%20food">staple</a> in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten. <a href="Sauerkraut">Sauerkraut</a> was used by Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a> during long ship voyages.

<a href="Jacques%20Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> first brought cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, and it was probably planted by the early English colonists, despite the lack of written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a>. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the <a href="First%20Fleet">First Fleet</a>, and were planted the same year on <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the <a href="Sydney%20Markets">Sydney Markets</a>.

There are several "<a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>" entries related to cabbage. These include the heaviest cabbage, at , heaviest red cabbage, at , longest <a href="cabbage%20roll">cabbage roll</a>, at , and the largest cabbage dish, at . In 2012, Scott Robb of <a href="Palmer%2C%20Alaska">Palmer, Alaska</a>, broke the world record for heaviest cabbage at .

Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads, produced during the first year of its biennial cycle. Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a <a href="Soil%20pH">pH</a> between 6.0 and 6.8. For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a> during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves. Temperatures between prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature <a href="bolting%20%28horticulture%29">bolting</a> (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called <a href="vernalization">vernalization</a>) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period. The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about . Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.
Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being <a href="transplanting">transplanted</a> outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested. Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted deep at a soil temperature between . Growers normally place plants apart. Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity. Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use; these are generally called "flowering cabbage". They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink. Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days. Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch. They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade. The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed. Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth. Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include: growth in the compacted soils that result from <a href="no-till%20farming">no-till farming</a> practices, drought, <a href="waterlogging%20%28agriculture%29">waterlogging</a>, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.

When being grown for seed, cabbages must be isolated from other "B. oleracea" subspecies, including the wild varieties, by to prevent cross-pollination. Other "Brassica" <a href="species">species</a>, such as "<a href="Brassica%20rapa">B. rapa</a>", "<a href="Brassica%20juncea">B. juncea</a>", "<a href="Brassica%20nigra">B. nigra</a>", "<a href="Brassica%20napus">B. napus</a>" and "<a href="Raphanus%20sativus">Raphanus sativus</a>", do not readily cross-pollinate.

There are several <a href="cultivar%20group">cultivar group</a>s of cabbage, each including many cultivars:

Some sources only delineate three cultivars: savoy, red and white, with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed into the latter.

Due to its high level of nutrient requirements, cabbage is prone to <a href="micronutrient%20deficiency">nutrient deficiencies</a>, including <a href="Boron%20deficiency%20%28plant%20disorder%29">boron</a>, <a href="Calcium%20deficiency%20%28plant%20disorder%29">calcium</a>, <a href="Phosphorus%20deficiency">phosphorus</a> and <a href="Potassium%20deficiency%20%28plants%29">potassium</a>. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.

Fungal diseases include <a href="Rhizoctonia%20solani">wirestem</a>, which causes weak or dying transplants; <a href="Fusarium">"Fusarium" yellows</a>, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and <a href="Blackleg%20%28Brassica%29">blackleg</a> (see "<a href="Leptosphaeria%20maculans">Leptosphaeria maculans</a>"), which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi "<a href="Alternaria%20brassicae">Alternaria brassicae</a>" and "<a href="Alternaria%20brassicicola">A. brassicicola</a>" cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. "<a href="Rhizoctonia%20solani">Rhizoctonia solani</a>" causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.

One of the most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is <a href="black%20rot">black rot</a>, caused by "<a href="Xanthomonas%20campestris">Xanthomonas campestris</a>", which causes <a href="chlorosis">chlorotic</a> and <a href="necrosis">necrotic</a> lesions that start at the leaf margins, and <a href="wilting">wilting</a> of plants. <a href="Clubroot">Clubroot</a>, caused by the soilborne <a href="slime%20mold">slime mold</a>-like organism "Plasmodiophora brassicae", results in swollen, club-like roots. <a href="Downy%20mildew">Downy mildew</a>, a parasitic disease caused by the <a href="oomycete">oomycete</a> "<a href="Peronospora%20parasitica">Peronospora parasitica</a>", produces pale leaves with white, brownish or olive <a href="mildew">mildew</a> on the lower leaf surfaces; this is often confused with the fungal disease <a href="powdery%20mildew">powdery mildew</a>.

Pests include <a href="root-knot%20nematode">root-knot nematode</a>s and <a href="Delia%20radicum">cabbage maggot</a>s, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; <a href="harlequin%20bug">harlequin bug</a>s, which cause white and yellow leaves; <a href="thrip">thrip</a>s, which lead to leaves with white-bronze spots; <a href="striped%20flea%20beetle">striped flea beetle</a>s, which riddle leaves with small holes; and <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the "small cabbage white butterfly" ("<a href="Pieris%20rapae">Pieris rapae</a>"), commonly known in the United States as the "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large white butterfly ("<a href="Pieris%20brassicae">Pieris brassicae</a>") is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth ("<a href="Plutella%20xylostella">Plutella xylostella</a>") and the cabbage moth ("<a href="Mamestra%20brassicae">Mamestra brassicae</a>") thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. The cabbage looper ("<a href="Cabbage%20looper">Trichoplusia ni</a>") is infamous in North America for its voracious appetite and for producing frass that contaminates plants. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly ("<a href="Delia%20radicum">Delia radicum</a>") and the cabbage maggot ("<a href="Hylemya%20brassicae">Hylemya brassicae</a>"), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.

Planting near other members of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in previous years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.

In 2014, global production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 71.8 million <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s, led by China with 47% of the world total (table). Other major producers were India, Russia, and South Korea.

Cabbages sold for market are generally smaller, and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale. Those used for processing, especially sauerkraut, are larger and have a lower percentage of water. Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used, with hand-harvesting generally used for cabbages destined for market sales. In commercial-scale operations, hand-harvested cabbages are trimmed, sorted, and packed directly in the field to increase efficiency. <a href="Vacuum%20cooling">Vacuum cooling</a> rapidly refrigerates the vegetable, allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product. Cabbage can be stored the longest at with a humidity of 90–100 percent; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity. When stored under less ideal conditions, cabbage can still last up to four months.

Cabbage consumption varies widely around the world: Russia has the highest annual per capita consumption at , followed by Belgium at , the Netherlands at , and Spain at . Americans consume annually per capita.

Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or <a href="steaming">steaming</a> it, though many cuisines pickle, <a href="stewing">stew</a>, <a href="sauteing">sautée</a> or <a href="braising">braise</a> cabbage. Pickling is one of the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a> and <a href="kimchi">kimchi</a>, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage ("B. rapa"). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. <a href="Bean%20curd">Bean curd</a> and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish <a href="bubble%20and%20squeak">bubble and squeak</a> is made primarily with leftover <a href="potato">potato</a> and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage is one of the main food crops, and it features prominently in <a href="Polish%20cuisine">Polish cuisine</a>. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as <a href="bigos">bigos</a> (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) <a href="go%C5%82%C4%85bki">gołąbki</a> (stuffed cabbage) and <a href="pierogi">pierogi</a> (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of <a href="coleslaw">coleslaw</a>, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.

The characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by <a href="glucosinolate">glucosinolate</a>s, a class of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>-containing <a href="glucoside">glucoside</a>s. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages. Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor and taste. These develop when cabbage is overcooked and <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> gas is produced.

Cabbage is a rich source of <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> and <a href="vitamin%20K">vitamin K</a>, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the <a href="Daily%20Value">Daily Value</a> (DV) per 100-gram amount (right table of USDA nutrient values). Cabbage is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of <a href="vitamin%20B6">vitamin B6</a> and <a href="folate">folate</a>, with no other nutrients having significant content per 100-gram serving (table).

Basic research on cabbage <a href="phytochemicals">phytochemicals</a> is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include <a href="sulforaphane">sulforaphane</a> and other <a href="glucosinolate">glucosinolate</a>s which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes during <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against <a href="colon%20cancer">colon cancer</a>. Cabbage is a source of <a href="indole-3-carbinol">indole-3-carbinol</a>, a chemical under <a href="basic%20research">basic research</a> for its possible properties.

In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a <a href="herbalism">medicinal herb</a> for a variety of purported health benefits. For example, the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> recommended consuming the vegetable as a <a href="laxative">laxative</a>, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">mushroom poisoning</a>, for eye <a href="salve">salve</a>s, and for <a href="liniment">liniment</a>s used to help bruises heal. In "<a href="De%20Agri%20Cultura">De Agri Cultura</a>" ("On Agriculture"), <a href="Cato%20the%20Elder">Cato the Elder</a> suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure <a href="hangover">hangover</a>s. Similarly, the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.

The cooling properties of the leaves were used in Britain as a treatment for <a href="trench%20foot">trench foot</a> in World War I, and as <a href="compression%20bandage">compresses</a> for <a href="ulcer">ulcer</a>s and <a href="mastitis">breast abscesses</a>. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of <a href="breast%20engorgement">engorged breasts</a>, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European <a href="traditional%20medicine">folk medicine</a> include treatments for <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, <a href="sore%20throat">sore throat</a>, <a href="Dysphonia">hoarseness</a>, <a href="baby%20colic">colic</a>, and <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">melancholy</a>. In the United States, cabbage has been used as a hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent <a href="sunstroke">sunstroke</a>, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve <a href="croup">croup</a>. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in <a href="poultice">poultice</a>s to remove <a href="boil">boil</a>s and treat <a href="wart">wart</a>s, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>, and ulcers.

Excessive consumption of cabbage may lead to increased <a href="intestinal%20gas">intestinal gas</a> which causes <a href="bloating">bloating</a> and <a href="flatulence">flatulence</a> due to the <a href="trisaccharide">trisaccharide</a> <a href="raffinose">raffinose</a>, which the human <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a> cannot <a href="digestion">digest</a>.

Cabbage has been linked to outbreaks of some <a href="food-borne%20illness">food-borne illness</a>es, including "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>" and "<a href="Clostridium%20botulinum">Clostridium botulinum</a>". The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. "<a href="Shigella">Shigella</a>" species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.

Cabbage and other <a href="cruciferous%20vegetable">cruciferous vegetable</a>s contain small amounts of <a href="thiocyanate">thiocyanate</a>, a compound associated with <a href="goiter">goiter</a> formation when <a href="iodine%20deficiency">iodine</a> intake is deficient.

Voting Rights Act of 1965

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of <a href="federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal</a> <a href="legislation">legislation</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> that prohibits racial discrimination in <a href="voting">voting</a>. It was signed into law by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> during the height of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> on August 6, 1965, and <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the <a href="Voting%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">voting rights</a> guaranteed by the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendments</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, the Act secured the right to vote for <a href="Race%20and%20ethnicity%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial minorities</a> throughout the country, especially in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> legislation ever enacted in the country.

The Act contains numerous provisions that regulate elections. The Act's "general provisions" provide nationwide protections for voting rights. Section 2 is a general provision that prohibits every state and local government from imposing any voting law that results in discrimination against racial or language minorities. Other general provisions specifically outlaw <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>s and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities.

The Act also contains "special provisions" that apply to only certain jurisdictions. A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement, which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving preapproval from the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> or the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">U.S. District Court for D.C.</a> that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities. Another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide <a href="bilingual">bilingual</a> ballots and other election materials.

Section 5 and most other special provisions apply to jurisdictions encompassed by the "coverage formula" prescribed in Section 4(b). The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965, and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975. In "<a href="Shelby%20County%20v.%20Holder">Shelby County v. Holder</a>" (2013), the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> <a href="Judicial%20review%20in%20the%20United%20States">struck down</a> the coverage formula as unconstitutional, reasoning that it was no longer responsive to current conditions. The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without a coverage formula, Section 5 is unenforceable.

As initially ratified, the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> granted each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents. After the <a href="Civil%20War%20%28United%20States%29">Civil War</a>, the three <a href="Reconstruction%20Amendments">Reconstruction Amendments</a> were ratified and limited this discretion. The <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> (1865) prohibits <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>; the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> (1868) grants <a href="citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">citizenship</a> to anyone "born or naturalized in the United States" and guarantees every person <a href="Due%20Process%20Clause">due process</a> and <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">equal protection</a> rights; and the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a> (1870) provides that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." These Amendments also empower <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress</a> to <a href="Congressional%20power%20of%20enforcement">enforce</a> their provisions through "appropriate legislation".

To enforce the Reconstruction Amendments, Congress passed the <a href="Enforcement%20Acts">Enforcement Acts</a> in the 1870s. The Acts criminalized the obstruction of a citizen's <a href="voting%20rights">voting rights</a> and provided for federal supervision of the electoral process, including <a href="voter%20registration">voter registration</a>. However, in 1875 the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> struck down parts of the legislation as unconstitutional in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Cruikshank">United States v. Cruikshank</a>" and "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Reese">United States v. Reese</a>". After the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a> ended in 1877, enforcement of these laws became erratic, and in 1894, Congress repealed most of their provisions.

Southern states generally sought to disenfranchise racial minorities during and after Reconstruction. From 1868 to 1888, <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a> and violence throughout the South suppressed the <a href="African-American">African-American</a> vote. From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a>; they amended their <a href="State%20constitution%20%28United%20States%29">constitutions</a> and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>s, <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll taxes</a>, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and <a href="grandfather%20clause">grandfather clause</a>s that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible). During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In "<a href="Giles%20v.%20Harris">Giles v. Harris</a>" (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the <a href="federal%20judiciary%20of%20the%20United%20States">judiciary</a> did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote.

In the 1950s, the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> increased pressure on the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20government">federal government</a> to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201957">Civil Rights Act of 1957</a>. This legislation authorized the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> to sue for <a href="injunctive%20relief">injunctive relief</a> on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were denied, created the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice%20Civil%20Rights%20Division">Civil Rights Division</a> within the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the <a href="Commission%20on%20Civil%20Rights">Commission on Civil Rights</a> to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201960">Civil Rights Act of 1960</a>, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.

Although these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights, strict legal standards made it difficult for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the <a href="electoral%20roll">electoral roll</a>s, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">district court</a> judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South increased only marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.

Congress responded to rampant discrimination against racial minorities in <a href="public%20accommodations">public accommodations</a> and <a href="government%20services">government services</a> by passing the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. The Act included some voting rights protections; it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter and to accept applications that contained minor errors, and it created a <a href="rebuttable%20presumption">rebuttable presumption</a> that persons with a sixth-grade education were sufficiently literate to vote. However, despite lobbying from civil rights leaders, the Act did not prohibit most forms of voting discrimination. <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> recognized this, and shortly after the 1964 elections in which <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> gained overwhelming majorities in both chambers of Congress, he privately instructed Attorney General <a href="Nicholas%20Katzenbach">Nicholas Katzenbach</a> to draft "the goddamndest, toughest voting rights act that you can". However, Johnson did not publicly push for the legislation at the time; his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his <a href="Great%20Society">Great Society</a> reforms by angering <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a> in Congress.

Following the 1964 elections, civil rights organizations such as the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) and the <a href="Student%20Nonviolent%20Coordinating%20Committee">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC) pushed for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. Their efforts culminated in protests in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, particularly in the city of <a href="Selma%2C%20Alabama">Selma</a>, where County Sheriff <a href="Jim%20Clark%20%28sheriff%29">Jim Clark</a>'s police force violently resisted African-American voter registration efforts. Speaking about the voting rights push in Selma, <a href="James%20Forman">James Forman</a> of SNCC said:
Our strategy, as usual, was to force the U.S. government to intervene in case there were arrests—and if they did not intervene, that inaction would once again prove the government was not on our side and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks. Our slogan for this drive was "<a href="One%20Man%2C%20One%20Vote">One Man, One Vote</a>."

In January 1965, <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, <a href="James%20Bevel">James Bevel</a>, and other civil rights leaders organized several demonstrations in Selma that led to violent clashes with police. These marches received national media coverage and drew attention to the issue of voting rights. King and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on February 1 for violating an anti-parade <a href="local%20ordinance">ordinance</a>; this inspired similar marches in the following days, causing hundreds more to be arrested. On February 4, civil rights leader <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> gave a militant speech in Selma in which he said that many African Americans did not support King's nonviolent approach; he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting King. The next day, King was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights, "Letter From A Selma Jail", appeared in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". 

With the nation paying increasing attention to Selma and voting rights, President Johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation, and on February 6, he announced he would send a proposal to Congress. However, he did not reveal the proposal's content or when it would come before Congress.

On February 18 in <a href="Marion%2C%20Alabama">Marion, Alabama</a>, state troopers violently broke up a nighttime voting-rights march during which officer <a href="James%20Bonard%20Fowler">James Bonard Fowler</a> shot and killed young African-American protester <a href="Jimmie%20Lee%20Jackson">Jimmie Lee Jackson</a>, who was unarmed and protecting his mother. Spurred by this event, and at the initiation of Bevel, on March 7 SCLC and SNCC began the <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a> in which Selma residents proceeded to march to Alabama's capital, <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>, to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> with their grievances. On the first march, demonstrators were stopped by state and county police on horseback at the <a href="Edmund%20Pettus%20Bridge">Edmund Pettus Bridge</a> near Selma. The police shot <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> into the crowd and trampled protesters. Televised footage of the scene, which became known as "Bloody Sunday", generated outrage across the country.

In the wake of the events in Selma, President Johnson, addressing a televised joint session of Congress on March 15, called on legislators to enact expansive voting rights legislation. He concluded his speech with the words "<a href="we%20shall%20overcome">we shall overcome</a>", a major anthem of the Civil Rights Movement. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress two days later while civil rights leaders, now under the protection of federal troops, led a march of 25,000 people from Selma to Montgomery.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress on March 17, 1965 as S. 1564, and it was jointly sponsored by Senate Majority Leader <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Mike Mansfield</a> (D-MT) and Senate Minority Leader <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a> (R-IL), both of whom had worked with Attorney General Katzenbach to draft the bill's language. Although Democrats held two-thirds of the seats in both chambers of Congress after the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201964">1964 Senate elections</a>, Johnson worried that Southern Democrats would <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a> the legislation, as they had opposed other civil rights efforts. He enlisted Dirksen to help gain <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> support. Dirksen did not originally intend to support voting rights legislation so soon after supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but he expressed willingness to accept "revolutionary" legislation after learning about the police violence against marchers in Selma on Bloody Sunday. Given Dirksen's key role in helping Katzenbach draft the legislation, it became known informally as the "Dirksenbach" bill. After Mansfield and Dirksen introduced the bill, 64 additional Senators agreed to cosponsor it, with a total 46 Democratic and 20 Republican cosponsors.

The bill contained several special provisions that targeted certain state and local governments: a "coverage formula" that determined which jurisdictions were subject to the Act's other special provisions ("covered jurisdictions"); a "preclearance" requirement that prohibited covered jurisdictions from implementing changes to their voting procedures without first receiving approval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the changes were not discriminatory; and the suspension of "tests or devices", such as literacy tests, in covered jurisdictions. The bill also authorized the assignment of federal examiners to register voters, and of federal observers to monitor elections, to covered jurisdictions that were found to have engaged in egregious discrimination. The bill set these special provisions to expire after five years.

The scope of the coverage formula was a matter of contentious Congressional debate. The coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if: (1) the jurisdiction maintained a "test or device" on November 1, 1964, and (2) less than 50% of the jurisdiction's voting-age residents either were registered to vote on November 1, 1964 or cast a <a href="ballot">ballot</a> in the November 1964 presidential election. This formula reached few jurisdictions outside the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>. To appease legislators who felt that the bill unfairly targeted Southern jurisdictions, the bill included a general prohibition on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide. The bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to "bail out" of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a "test or device" for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Additionally, the bill included a "bail in" provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non-covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in the special provisions.

The bill was first considered by the <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, whose chair, Senator <a href="James%20Eastland">James Eastland</a> (D-MS), opposed the legislation with several other Southern Senators on the committee. To prevent the bill from dying in committee, Mansfield proposed a <a href="Motion%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">motion</a> to require the Judiciary Committee to report the bill out of committee by April 9, which the Senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13. During the committee's consideration of the bill, Senator <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> (D-MA) led an effort to amend the bill to prohibit poll taxes. Although the <a href="Twenty-fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-fourth Amendment</a>—which banned the use of poll taxes in federal elections— was ratified a year earlier, Johnson's administration and the bill's sponsors did not include a provision in the voting rights bill banning poll taxes in "state" elections because they feared courts would strike down the legislation as unconstitutional. Additionally, by excluding poll taxes from the definition of "tests or devices", the coverage formula did not reach <a href="Texas">Texas</a> or <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, mitigating opposition from those two states' influential <a href="congressional%20delegation">congressional delegation</a>s. Nonetheless, with the support of <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a> committee members, Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9-4 vote. In response, Dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from the coverage formula any state that had at least 60% of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed the national average in the preceding presidential election. This amendment, which effectively exempted all states from coverage except <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent. Dirksen offered to drop the amendment if the poll tax ban were removed. Ultimately, the bill was reported out of committee on April 9 by a 12-4 vote without a recommendation.

On April 22, the full Senate started debating the bill. Dirksen spoke first on the bill's behalf, saying that "legislation is needed if the unequivocal mandate of the Fifteenth Amendment ... is to be enforced and made effective, and if the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> is to be made truly meaningful." Senator <a href="Strom%20Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> (R-SC) retorted that the bill would lead to "despotism and tyranny", and Senator <a href="Sam%20Ervin">Sam Ervin</a> (D-NC) argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under to establish voter qualifications and because the bill's special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions. On May 6, Ervin offered an amendment to abolish the coverage formula's automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration. This amendment overwhelmingly failed, with 42 Democrats and 22 Republicans voting against it. After lengthy debate, Ted Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49-45 on May 11. However, the Senate agreed to include a provision authorizing the Attorney General to sue any jurisdiction, covered or non-covered, to challenge its use of poll taxes. An amendment offered by Senator <a href="Robert%20Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a> (D-NY) to enfranchise English-illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth-grade education in a non-English-speaking school also passed by 48-19. Southern legislators offered a series of amendments to weaken the bill, all of which failed.

On May 25, the Senate voted for <a href="cloture">cloture</a> by a 70-30 vote, thus overcoming the threat of filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.

<a href="Emanuel%20Celler">Emanuel Celler</a> (D-NY), Chair of the <a href="House%20Judiciary%20Committee">House Judiciary Committee</a>, introduced the Voting Rights Act in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee was the first committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, <a href="William%20Moore%20McCulloch">William McCulloch</a> (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, but it did not file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="John%20William%20McCormack">John McCormack</a>'s support. The bill was next considered by the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Rules">Rules Committee</a>, whose chair, <a href="Howard%20W.%20Smith">Howard W. Smith</a> (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.

To defeat the Voting Rights Act, McCulloch introduced an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It would have allowed the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, and it would have imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by <a href="House%20Minority%20Leader">House Minority Leader</a> <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to the Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after <a href="William%20M.%20Tuck">William M. Tuck</a> (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).

The chambers appointed a <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a> to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach enlisted the help of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee. The House approved this <a href="conference%20report">conference report</a> version of the bill on August 3 by a 328-74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20), and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79-18 vote (Democrats 49-17, Republicans 30-1). On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>, <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28Georgia%20politician%29">John Lewis</a>, and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.

Congress enacted major amendments to the Act in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006. Each amendment coincided with an impending expiration of some or all of the Act's special provisions. Originally set to expire by 1970, Congress repeatedly reauthorized the special provisions in recognition of continuing voting discrimination. Congress extended the coverage formula and special provisions tied to it, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006. In 1970 and 1975, Congress also expanded the reach of the coverage formula by supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates. Coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when Congress expanded the meaning of "tests or devices" to encompass any jurisdiction that provided English-only election information, such as ballots, if the jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of the jurisdiction's voting-age citizens. These expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage, including many outside of the South. To ease the burdens of the reauthorized special provisions, Congress liberalized the bailout procedure in 1982 by allowing jurisdictions to escape coverage by complying with the Act and affirmatively acting to expand minority <a href="political%20participation">political participation</a>.

In addition to reauthorizing the original special provisions and expanding coverage, Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act. For instance, Congress expanded the original ban on "tests or devices" to apply nationwide in 1970, and in 1975, Congress made the ban permanent. Separately, in 1975 Congress expanded the Act's scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination. Congress defined "language minority" to mean "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage." Congress amended various provisions, such as the preclearance requirement and Section 2's general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws, to prohibit discrimination against language minorities. Congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in Section 203, which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions with large numbers of English-illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information in the language of the language minority group. Originally set to expire after 10 years, Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years, expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years, and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years. The bilingual election requirements have remained controversial, with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that the bilingual election requirements constitute costly <a href="unfunded%20mandate">unfunded mandate</a>s.

Several of the amendments responded to judicial rulings with which Congress disagreed. In 1982, Congress amended the Act to overturn the Supreme Court case "<a href="Mobile%20v.%20Bolden">Mobile v. Bolden</a>" (1980), which held that the general prohibition of voting discrimination prescribed in Section 2 prohibited only "purposeful" discrimination. Congress responded by expanding Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory "effect", regardless of whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. The creation of this "results test" shifted the majority of vote dilution litigation brought under the Act from preclearance lawsuits to Section 2 lawsuits. In 2006, Congress amended the Act to overturn two Supreme Court cases: "<a href="Reno%20v.%20Bossier%20Parish%20School%20Board">Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</a>" (2000), which interpreted the Section 5 preclearance requirement to prohibit only voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a "retrogressive" discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and "<a href="Georgia%20v.%20Ashcroft">Georgia v. Ashcroft</a>" (2003), which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. In 2014, the Voting Rights Amendments Act was introduced in Congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions in response to the Supreme Court case "<a href="Shelby%20County%20v.%20Holder">Shelby County v. Holder</a>" (2013), which struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional. It was referred to the Constitution and Civil Justice congressional subcommittee on February 11, 2015, but no action was taken on it, and it expired.

The Act contains two types of provisions: "general provisions", which apply nationwide, and "special provisions", which apply to only certain states and local governments. Most provisions are designed to protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities. The term "language minority" means "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage." The Act's provisions have been colored by numerous judicial interpretations and congressional amendments.

Section 2 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a "voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure ... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race," color, or language minority status. The Supreme Court has allowed private <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a>s to sue to enforce this prohibition. In "Mobile v. Bolden" (1980), the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965, Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were "intentionally" enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. In 1982, Congress amended Section 2 to create a "results" test, which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. The 1982 amendments provided that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>.

When determining whether a jurisdiction's election law violates this general prohibition, courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments ("Senate Factors"), including:
The report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive, allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion.

Section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination: "vote denial", in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and "vote dilution", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished. Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's <a href="redistricting">redistricting</a> plan or use of <a href="at-large">at-large</a>/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates. An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction. Redistricting plans can be <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>ed to dilute votes cast by minorities by "packing" high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or "cracking" minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts.

In "<a href="Thornburg%20v.%20Gingles">Thornburg v. Gingles</a>" (1986), the Supreme Court used the term "vote dilution through submergence" to describe claims that a jurisdiction's use of an at-large/multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes, and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2. Under the "Gingles" test, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions:
The first precondition is known as the "compactness" requirement and concerns whether a <a href="majority-minority%20district">majority-minority district</a> can be created. The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the "racially polarized voting" or "racial bloc voting" requirement, and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other. If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist, then the plaintiff must additionally show, using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence, that under the "<a href="totality%20of%20the%20circumstances">totality of the circumstances</a>", the jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice.

Subsequent litigation further defined the contours of "vote dilution through submergence" claims. In "<a href="Bartlett%20v.%20Strickland">Bartlett v. Strickland</a>" (2009), the Supreme Court held that the first "Gingles" precondition can be satisfied "only" if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of "crossover" votes from some members of the majority group. In contrast, the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the "Gingles" preconditions as a coalition, and lower courts have split on the issue.

The Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the "totality of the circumstances" test in "<a href="Johnson%20v.%20De%20Grandy">Johnson v. De Grandy</a>" (1994). The Court emphasized that the existence of the three "Gingles" preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three "Gingles" preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional "opportunity" to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election "results", which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.

An issue regarding the third "Gingles" precondition remains unresolved. In "Gingles", the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A <a href="plurality%20opinion">plurality</a> of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a "results" test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in "racial" discrimination. Since "Gingles", lower courts have split on the issue.

Although most Section 2 litigation has involved claims of vote dilution through submergence, courts also have addressed other types of vote dilution under this provision. In "<a href="Holder%20v.%20Hall">Holder v. Hall</a>" (1994), the Supreme Court held that claims that minority votes are diluted by the small size of a governing body, such as a one-person <a href="county%20commission">county commission</a>, may not be brought under Section 2. A plurality of the Court reasoned that no uniform, non-dilutive "benchmark" size for a governing body exists, making relief under Section 2 impossible. Another type of vote dilution may result from a jurisdiction's requirement that a candidate be elected by a <a href="majority%20vote">majority vote</a>. A majority-vote requirement may cause a minority group's candidate of choice, who would have won the election with a simple <a href="plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a> of votes, to lose after a majority of voters unite behind another candidate in a <a href="two-round%20system">runoff election</a>. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether such claims may be brought under Section 2, and lower courts have reached different conclusions on the issue.

In addition to claims of vote dilution, courts have considered vote denial claims brought under Section 2. The Supreme Court, in "<a href="Richardson%20v.%20Ramirez">Richardson v. Ramirez</a>" (1974), held that <a href="felony%20disenfranchisement">felony disenfranchisement</a> laws cannot violate Section 2 because, among other reasons, Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment permits such laws. A federal district court in Mississippi held that a "dual registration" system that requires a person to register to vote separately for state elections and local elections may violate Section 2 if the system has a racially disparate impact in light of the Senate Factors. Starting in 2013, lower federal courts began to consider various challenges to <a href="voter%20ID%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">voter ID laws</a> brought under Section 2.

The Act contains several specific prohibitions on conduct that may interfere with a person's ability to cast an effective vote. One of these prohibitions is prescribed in Section 201, which prohibits any jurisdiction from requiring a person to comply with any "test or device" to register to vote or cast a ballot. The term "test or device" is defined as literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting. Before the Act's enactment, these devices were the primary tools used by jurisdictions to prevent racial minorities from voting. Originally, the Act suspended tests or devices temporarily in jurisdictions covered by the Section 4(b) coverage formula, but Congress subsequently expanded the prohibition to the entire country and made it permanent. Relatedly, Section 202 prohibits jurisdictions from imposing any "durational residency requirement" that requires persons to have lived in the jurisdiction for more than 30 days before being eligible to vote in a presidential election.

Several further protections for voters are contained in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under <a href="color%20of%20law">color of law</a> from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address <a href="voter%20fraud">voter fraud</a>: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.

Finally, under Section 208, a jurisdiction may not prevent anyone who is English-illiterate or has a <a href="disability">disability</a> from being accompanied into the ballot box by an assistant of the person's choice. The only exceptions are that the assistant may not be an <a href="Law%20of%20agency">agent</a> of the person's employer or union.

Section 3(c) contains a "bail-in" or "pocket trigger" process by which jurisdictions that fall outside the coverage formula of Section 4(b) may become subject to preclearance. Under this provision, if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters in violation of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, a court may order the jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government. Because courts have interpreted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to prohibit only intentional discrimination, a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if the plaintiff proves that the jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate.

Section 3(c) contains its own preclearance language and differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction until such time as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long as the court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.

During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) was little used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, including 16 local governments and the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in "Shelby County v. Holder" (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following "Shelby County", courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in <a href="Evergreen%2C%20Alabama">Evergreen, Alabama</a>.

A more narrow bail-in process pertaining to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, a federal court may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) are not subject to preclearance.

Section 4(b) contains a "coverage formula" that determines which states and local governments may be subjected to the Act's other special provisions (except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirements, which fall under a different formula). Congress intended for the coverage formula to encompass the most pervasively discriminatory jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is covered by the formula if:


As originally enacted, the coverage formula contained only November 1964 triggering dates; subsequent revisions to the law supplemented it with the additional triggering dates of November 1968 and November 1972, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage. For purposes of the coverage formula, the term "test or device" includes the same four devices prohibited nationally by Section 201—literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting—and one further device defined in Section 4(f)(3): in jurisdictions where more than 5% of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group, any practice or requirement by which registration or election materials are provided only in English. The types of jurisdictions that the coverage formula applies to include states and "political subdivisions" of states. Section 14(c)(2) defines "political subdivision" to mean any county, parish, or "other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting."

The 1965 coverage formula included the whole of Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia; and some subdivisions (usually counties) in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, and North Carolina. The 1968 coverage resulted in the partial coverage of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Wyoming. Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, and Wyoming filed successful "bailout" lawsuits, as also provided by section 4. The 1972 coverage formula covered the whole of Alaska, Arizona, and Texas, and parts of California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota. The special provisions of the Act were due to expire in 1970, and Congress renewed them for another five years. In 1975, the Act's special provisions were extended for another seven years. In 1982, the coverage formula was extended again, this time for 25 years, but no changes were made to the coverage, and in 2006, the coverage formula was again extended for 25 years.

Throughout its history, the coverage formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, most of which were in the Deep South. In "Shelby County v. Holder" (2013), the Supreme Court declared the coverage formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> and <a href="Federalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">federalism</a>. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.

Section 5 requires that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval, known as "preclearance", before implementing changes to their election laws. A covered jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race or language minority status; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden, the federal government will deny preclearance and the jurisdiction's change will not go into effect. The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5's scope in "<a href="Allen%20v.%20State%20Board%20of%20Election">Allen v. State Board of Election</a>" (1969), holding that any change in a jurisdiction's voting practices, even if minor, must be submitted for preclearance. The Court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared, private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff's local district court before a three-judge panel. In these Section 5 "enforcement actions", a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change, and if so, whether the change has been precleared. If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance, then the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change. However, the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved.

Jurisdictions may seek preclearance through either an "administrative preclearance" process or a "judicial preclearance" process. If a jurisdiction seeks administrative preclearance, the Attorney General will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change, the Attorney General has 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the Attorney General interposes an objection, then the change is not precleared and may not be implemented. The Attorney General's decision is not subject to <a href="Judicial%20review%20in%20the%20United%20States">judicial review</a>, but if the Attorney General interposes an objection, the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance, and the court may disregard the Attorney General's objection at its discretion. If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance, it must file a <a href="declaratory%20judgment">declaratory judgment</a> action against the Attorney General in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">U.S. District Court for D.C.</a> A three-judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect, and the losing party may appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Private parties may <a href="intervention%20%28law%29">intervene</a> in judicial preclearance lawsuits.

In several cases, the Supreme Court has addressed the meaning of "discriminatory effect" and "discriminatory purpose" for Section 5 purposes. In "<a href="Beer%20v.%20United%20States">Beer v. United States</a>" (1976), the Court held that for a voting change to have a prohibited discriminatory effect, it must result in "retrogression" (backsliding). Under this standard, a voting change that causes discrimination, but does not result in "more" discrimination than before the change was made, cannot be denied preclearance for having a discriminatory effect. For example, replacing a poll tax with an equally expensive voter registration fee is not a "retrogressive" change because it causes equal discrimination, not more. Relying on the Senate report for the Act, the Court reasoned that the retrogression standard was the correct interpretation of the term "discriminatory effect" because Section 5's purpose is " 'to insure that [the gains thus far achieved in minority political participation] shall not be destroyed through new [discriminatory] procedures' ". The retrogression standard applies irrespective of whether the voting change allegedly causes vote denial or vote dilution.

In 2003, the Supreme Court held in "Georgia v. Ashcroft" that courts should not determine that a new redistricting plan has a retrogressive effect solely because the plan decreases the number of minority-majority districts. The Court emphasized that judges should analyze various other factors under the "totality of the circumstances", such as whether the redistricting plan increases the number of "influence districts" in which a minority group is large enough to influence (but not decide) election outcomes. In 2006, Congress overturned this decision by amending Section 5 to explicitly state that "diminishing the ability [of a protected minority] to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of" Section 5. Uncertainty remains as to what this language precisely means and how courts may interpret it.

Before 2000, the "discriminatory purpose" prong of Section 5 was understood to mean "any" discriminatory purpose, which is the same standard used to determine whether discrimination is unconstitutional. In "<a href="Reno%20v.%20Bossier%20Parish">Reno v. Bossier Parish</a>" ("Bossier Parish II") (2000), the Supreme Court extended the retrogression standard, holding that for a voting change to have a "discriminatory purpose" under Section 5, the change must have been implemented for a "retrogressive" purpose. Therefore, a voting change intended to discriminate against a protected minority was permissible under Section 5 so long as the change was not intended to increase existing discrimination. This change significantly reduced the number of instances in which preclearance was denied based on discriminatory purpose. In 2006, Congress overturned "Bossier Parish II" by amending Section 5 to explicitly define "purpose" to mean "any discriminatory purpose."

Until the 2006 amendments to the Act, Section 6 allowed the appointment of "federal examiners" to oversee certain jurisdictions' voter registration functions. Federal examiners could be assigned to a covered jurisdiction if the Attorney General certified that
Federal examiners had the authority to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.

Under the Act's original framework, in any jurisdiction certified for federal examiners, the Attorney General could additionally require the appointment of "federal observers". By 2006, the federal examiner provision was used solely as a means to appoint federal observers. When Congress repealed the federal examiner provision in 2006, Congress amended Section 8 to allow for the assignment of federal observers to jurisdictions that satisfied the same certification criteria that had been used to appoint federal examiners.

Federal observers are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate the ballots. The goal of the federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process, such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot, intimidation or harassment of voters on <a href="election%20day">election day</a>, or improper vote counting. Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits. Between 1965 and the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in "Shelby County v. Holder" to strike down the coverage formula, the Attorney General certified 153 local governments across 11 states. Because of time and resource constraints, federal observers are not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election. Separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to "bail out" of its certification.

Under Section 4(a), a covered jurisdiction may seek exemption from coverage through a process called "bailout." To achieve an exemption, a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of the District Court for D.C. that the jurisdiction is eligible to bail out. As originally enacted, a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail out if it had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Therefore, a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed to prove that it had not misused a test or device since at least 1962. Until 1970, this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before the Act was enacted five years earlier in 1965, making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out. However, Section 4(a) also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner, discriminatory or otherwise; hence, under the original Act, a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement. But in the course of amending the Act in 1970 and 1975 to extend the special provisions, Congress also extended the period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years, respectively. These extensions continued the effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before the Act's enactment in 1965.

In 1982, Congress amended Section 4(a) to make bailout easier to achieve in two ways. First, Congress provided that if a state is covered, local governments in that state may bail out even if the state is ineligible to bail out. Second, Congress liberalized the eligibility criteria by replacing the 17-year requirement with a new standard, allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out by proving that in the 10 years preceding its bailout request:
Additionally, Congress required jurisdictions seeking bailout to produce evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and in comparison to the registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.

The 1982 amendment to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in "<a href="Northwest%20Austin%20Municipal%20Utility%20District%20No.%201%20v.%20Holder">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder</a>" (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters have the ability to bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in "Shelby County v. Holder" (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.

Separate provisions allow a covered jurisdiction that has been certified to receive federal observers to bail out of its certification alone. Under Section 13, the Attorney General may terminate the certification of a jurisdiction if 1) more than 50% of the jurisdiction's minority voting age population is registered to vote, and 2) there is no longer reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination. Alternatively, the District Court for D.C. may order the certification terminated.

Two provisions require certain jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials related to an election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.

Section 4(f)(4) applies to any jurisdiction encompassed by the Section 4(b) coverage formula where more than 5% of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group. Section 203(c) contains a formula that is separate from the Section 4(b) coverage formula, and therefore jurisdictions covered solely by 203(c) are not subject to the Act's other special provisions, such as preclearance. The Section 203(c) formula encompasses jurisdictions where the following conditions exist:

Section 203(b) defines "limited-English proficient" as being "unable to speak or understand English adequately enough
to participate in the electoral process". Determinations as to which jurisdictions satisfy the Section 203(c) criteria occur once a decade following completion of the decennial census; at these times, new jurisdictions may come into coverage while others may have their coverage terminated. Additionally, under Section 203(d), a jurisdiction may "bail out" of Section 203(c) coverage by proving in federal court that no language minority group within the jurisdiction has an English illiteracy rate that is higher than the national illiteracy rate. After the 2010 census, 150 jurisdictions across 25 states were covered under Section 203(c), including statewide coverage of California, Texas, and Florida.

After its enactment in 1965, the law immediately decreased racial discrimination in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and the assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for high numbers of racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), and a majority of African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate states</a> increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.

After the Act's initial success in combating tactics designed to deny minorities access to the polls, the Act became predominately used as a tool to challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory <a href="annexation">annexation</a>s, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and they were more likely to succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.

By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act facilitated a <a href="political%20realignment">political realignment</a> of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate <a href="Southern%20politics">Southern politics</a>. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began to vote for liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the <a href="Southern%20strategy">Southern strategy</a>. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.

A 2016 study in the "American Journal of Political Science" found "that members of Congress who represented jurisdictions subject to the preclearance requirement were substantially more supportive of civil rights–related legislation than legislators who did not represent covered jurisdictions." A 2018 study in "The Journal of Politics" found that Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act "increased black voter registration by 14–19 percentage points, white registration by 10–13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10–19 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites."

Early in the Act's enforcement history, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In "<a href="Katzenbach%20v.%20Morgan">Katzenbach v. Morgan</a>" (1966), the Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Although the Court had earlier held in "<a href="Lassiter%20v.%20Northampton%20County%20Board%20of%20Elections">Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections</a>" (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in "Morgan" the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such as the right to vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in "<a href="Oregon%20v.%20Mitchell">Oregon v. Mitchell</a>" (1970).

Also in "Oregon v. Mitchell", the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the <a href="Twenty-sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-sixth Amendment</a> the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in "Oregon v. Mitchell", and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.

The constitutionality of Section 2, which contains a general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws, has not been definitively explained by the Supreme Court. As amended in 1982, Section 2 prohibits any voting practice that has a discriminatory effect, irrespective of whether the practice was enacted or is administered for the purpose of discriminating. This "results test" contrasts with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, both of which directly prohibit only purposeful discrimination. Given this disparity, whether the Supreme Court would uphold the constitutionality of Section 2 as appropriate legislation passed to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and under what rationale, remains unclear.

In "Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks" (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, without a written opinion, a lower court's decision that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning was that the case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court is more likely to disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to "Brooks", the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.

The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Section 5 preclearance requirement in three cases. The first case was "<a href="South%20Carolina%20v.%20Katzenbach">South Carolina v. Katzenbach</a>" (1966), which was decided about five months after the Act's enactment. The Court held that Section 5 constituted a valid use of Congress's power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment, reasoning that "exceptional circumstances" of pervasive racial discrimination, combined with the inadequacy of case-by-case litigation in ending that discrimination, justified the preclearance requirement. The Court also upheld the constitutionality of the 1965 coverage formula, saying that it was "rational in both practice and theory" and that the bailout provision provided adequate relief for jurisdictions that may not deserve coverage.

The Supreme Court again upheld the preclearance requirement in "<a href="City%20of%20Rome%20v.%20United%20States">City of Rome v. United States</a>" (1980). The Court held that because Congress had explicit constitutional power to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments "by appropriate legislation", the Act did not violate principles of federalism. The Court also explicitly upheld the "discriminatory effect" prong of Section 5, stating that even though the Fifteenth Amendment directly prohibited only intentional discrimination, Congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate the risk that jurisdictions may engage in intentional discrimination. Finally, the Court upheld the 1975 extension of Section 5 because of the record of discrimination that continued to persist in the covered jurisdictions. The Court further suggested that the temporary nature of the special provisions was relevant to Section 5's constitutionality.

The final case in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was "<a href="Lopez%20v.%20Monterey%20County">Lopez v. Monterey County</a>" ("Lopez II") (1999). In "Lopez II", the Court reiterated its reasoning in "Katzenbach" and "Rome", and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement, even if the parent state was not itself a covered jurisdiction.

The 2006 extension of Section 5 was challenged before the Supreme Court in "<a href="Northwest%20Austin%20Municipal%20Utility%20District%20No.%201%20v.%20Holder">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder</a>" (2009). The lawsuit was brought by a municipal water district in Texas that elected members to a <a href="water%20board">water board</a>. The District wished to move a voting location from a private home to a public school, but that change was subject to preclearance because Texas was a covered jurisdiction. The District did not register voters, and thus it did not appear to qualify as a "political subdivision" eligible to bail out of coverage. Although the Court indicated in <a href="dicta">dicta</a> (a non-binding part of the court's opinion) that Section 5 presented difficult constitutional questions, it did not declare Section 5 unconstitutional; instead, it interpreted the law to allow any covered local government, including one that does not register voters, to obtain an exemption from preclearance if it meets the bailout requirements.

On November 9, 2012, the Supreme Court granted <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a> in the case of "<a href="Shelby%20County%20v.%20Holder">Shelby County v. Holder</a>" limited to the question of "whether Congress' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) ... exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, thus violating the <a href="Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a> and <a href="Article%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article IV of the United States Constitution</a>". On June 25, 2013, the Court struck down Section 4(b) as unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the coverage formula violates the constitutional principles of "equal sovereignty of the states" and federalism because its disparate treatment of the states is "based on 40 year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day", which makes the formula unresponsive to current needs. The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction may be subject to Section 5 preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. After the decision, several states that were fully or partially covered—including Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina—implemented laws that were previously denied preclearance. This prompted new legal challenges to these laws under other provisions unaffected by the Court's decision, such as Section 2.

While Section 2 and Section 5 prohibit jurisdictions from drawing electoral districts that dilute the votes of protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the <a href="justiciability">justiciability</a> of affirmative "racial gerrymandering" claims in "<a href="Shaw%20v.%20Reno">Shaw v. Reno</a>" (1993). In "<a href="Miller%20v.%20Johnson">Miller v. Johnson</a>" (1995), the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the "predominant factor" in determining how to draw district lines. For race to "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include "compactness, contiguity, [and] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests." If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated, then the redistricting plan is considered "racially gerrymandered" and must be subjected to <a href="strict%20scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a>, meaning that the redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional only if it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. In "<a href="Bush%20v.%20Vera">Bush v. Vera</a>" (1996), a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests, and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering.

Belgrade

Belgrade ( ; / Београд, meaning 'white city', ; ) is the <a href="Capital%20city">capital</a> and <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Serbia">largest city</a> of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. It is located at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> rivers, where the <a href="Pannonian%20Basin">Pannonian Plain</a> meets the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. The urban area of the City of Belgrade has a population of 1.23 million, while nearly 1.7 million people live within its administrative limits.

One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the <a href="Vin%C4%8Da%20culture">Vinča culture</a>, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, <a href="Thracians">Thraco</a>–<a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> inhabited the region, and after 279 BC, <a href="Celts">Celts</a> conquered the city, naming it "<a href="Singidunum">Singidūn</a>". It was <a href="Roman%20Serbia">conquered by the Romans</a> during the reign of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, and awarded <a href="Town%20privileges">city rights</a> in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a href="Frankish%20Empire">Frankish Empire</a>, the <a href="Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> before it became the seat of the <a href="List%20of%20Serbian%20monarchs">Serbian king</a> <a href="Stefan%20Dragutin%20of%20Serbia">Stephen Dragutin</a> (ruled 1282–1316). In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and became the seat of the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Smederevo">Sanjak of Smederevo</a>. It frequently passed from Ottoman to <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the <a href="Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe">Austro-Ottoman wars</a>. Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. <a href="Zemun">Northern Belgrade</a> remained the southernmost <a href="Austria-Hungary">Habsburg</a> post until 1918, when the city was reunited. As a strategic location, the city was battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times. Belgrade was the capital of <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> from its <a href="Creation%20of%20Yugoslavia">creation</a> in 1918 to its <a href="Montenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%202006">dissolution</a> in 2006.

Belgrade has a special <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Serbia">administrative status</a> within Serbia and it is one of the five statistical regions of Serbia. Its metropolitan territory is divided into <a href="Belgrade%23Municipalities">17 municipalities</a>, each with its own local council. The city of Belgrade covers 3.6% of Serbia's territory, and around 24% of the country's population lives within its administrative limits. It is classified as a Beta-<a href="Global%20city">Global City</a>.

<a href="Lithic%20reduction">Chipped stone tools</a> found in <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a> show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by <a href="hunter-gatherer">nomadic foragers</a> in the <a href="Palaeolithic">Palaeolithic</a> and <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> eras. Some of these tools belong are of <a href="Mousterian">Mousterian industry</a>, which are associated with <a href="Neanderthals">Neanderthals</a> rather than modern humans. <a href="Aurignacian">Aurignacian</a> and <a href="Gravettian">Gravettian</a> tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.

The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="Star%C4%8Devo%20culture">Starčevo culture</a>, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of <a href="Star%C4%8Devo">Starčevo</a>. The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the <a href="Vin%C4%8Da%20culture">Vinča culture</a> (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (<a href="Vin%C4%8Da-Belo%20Brdo">Vinča-Belo Brdo</a>). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest <a href="List%20of%20cities%20by%20time%20of%20continuous%20habitation">settlements by continuous habitation</a> and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe; anthropomorphic figurines such as the <a href="Lady%20of%20Vin%C4%8Da">Lady of Vinča</a>; the earliest known <a href="Copper%20Age">copper metallurgy</a> in Europe; and a <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a> form developed prior to the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ians and <a href="Minoans">Minoans</a>, known as the <a href="Old%20European%20script">Old European script</a>, dating back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.

Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from ancient myths and legends. The rock overlooking the confluence of the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> rivers has been identified as one of the places in the story of <a href="Jason">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>. <a href="Prehistory%20of%20Southeastern%20Europe">Paleo-Balkan tribes</a> of <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a> and <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> ruled this area prior to the Roman conquest. Belgrade was inhabited by a Thraco-Dacian tribe "Singi"; after the <a href="Gallic%20invasion%20of%20Balkans">Celtic invasion</a> in 279 BC, the <a href="Scordisci">Scordisci</a> took the city, naming it "Singidūn" ("dūn", fortress). In 34–33 BC, the Roman army, led by <a href="Silanus">Silanus</a>, reached Belgrade. It became the <a href="Roman%20Empire">romanised</a> "<a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a>" in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a "<a href="municipium">municipium</a>" by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged "<a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">colonia</a>" (highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor of Rome</a> —<a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a>, also known as <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>—was born in the territory of <a href="Naissus">Naissus</a> in southern Serbia, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, ending the brief revival of <a href="Religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">traditional Roman religions</a> under his predecessor <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian the Apostate</a>. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of <a href="Zemun">Taurunum (Zemun)</a>; the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.

In 442, the area was ravaged by <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun">Attila the Hun</a>. In 471, it was taken by <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a>, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Greece. As the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> left for Italy, another Germanic tribe, the <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a>, took over the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a>, pillaging cities and settling down. The <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, under <a href="Bayan%20I">Bayan I</a> conquered the whole region by 582. According to Byzantine chronicle "<a href="De%20Administrando%20Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>", the <a href="White%20Serbs">White Serbs</a> had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> (610–641). In 829 <a href="Khan%20Omurtag">Khan Omurtag</a> was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.

The first record of the name "Belograd" appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal letter to <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian ruler</a> <a href="Boris%20I">Boris I</a>. Later, this name appeared in several variants: Alba Bulgarica, Griechisch Weissenburg (High German for 'white fortress') , Nándorfehérvár (Hungarian for 'great Bulgarian white city'), Castelbianco (Venetian for 'white fortress'), among other names. For about four centuries, the city remained a battleground between the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the medieval <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a>. <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> (976–1025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First</a> and the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a>, but, while passing through during the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a> and his 190,000 <a href="Third%20Crusade">crusaders</a> saw Belgrade in ruins.

King <a href="Stefan%20Dragutin%20of%20Serbia">Stefan Dragutin</a> (r. 1276–1282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, <a href="Stephen%20V%20of%20Hungary">Stephen V of Hungary</a> in 1284, and it served as the capital of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Syrmia">Kingdom of Syrmia</a>, a vassal state to the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: "Dragutin István") is regarded as the first <a href="List%20of%20Serbian%20monarchs">Serbian king</a> to rule over Belgrade.

Following the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Maritsa">Maritsa (1371)</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kosovo">Kosovo field (1389)</a>, Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began its final fall to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The northern sections of what is now Serbia resisted as the <a href="Serbian%20Despotate">Serbian Despotate</a>, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under <a href="Stefan%20Lazarevi%C4%87">Stefan Lazarević</a>, the son of Serbian prince <a href="Lazar%20Hrebeljanovi%C4%87">Lazar Hrebeljanović</a>. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the <a href="Despot%20Stefan%20Tower">Despot's tower</a> and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist the Ottomans for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population of between 40,000 to 50,000 people.

In 1427, Stefan's successor <a href="%C4%90ura%C4%91%20Brankovi%C4%87">Đurađ Branković</a> had to return Belgrade to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian king</a>, and <a href="Smederevo%20fortress">Smederevo</a> became the new capital. Although the Ottomans captured most of the <a href="Serbian%20Despotate">Serbian Despotate</a>, Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár in Hungarian, was <a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281440%29">unsuccessfully besieged in 1440</a> and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers <a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281456%29">besieged it in 1456</a>, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The "<a href="noon%20bell">noon bell</a>" ordered by <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20III">Pope Callixtus III</a> commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.

Seven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> Sultan <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> and his 250,000 soldiers and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> to an area that has since become known as the "<a href="Belgrade%20forest">'</a>"<a href="Belgrade%20forest">Belgrade forest</a>""'. Belgrade was made the seat of the <a href="Pashalik%20of%20Belgrade">Pashalik of Belgrade</a> (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Ottoman rule introduced <a href="Ottoman%20architecture">Ottoman architecture</a>, including numerous mosques, and the city was revived with <a href="Oriental">Oriental</a> influences. In 1594, a major <a href="Banat%20Uprising">Serb rebellion</a> was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, <a href="Grand%20vizier">Grand Vizier</a> <a href="Sinan%20Pasha">Sinan Pasha</a> ordered the <a href="relic">relic</a>s of <a href="Saint%20Sava">Saint Sava</a> to be publicly torched on the <a href="Vra%C4%8Dar%20plateau">Vračar plateau</a>; in the 20th century, the <a href="Temple%20of%20Saint%20Sava">Temple of Saint Sava</a> was built to commemorate this event.

Occupied by the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburgs</a> three times (<a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281688%29">1688–1690</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia%20%281718%E2%80%9339%29">1717–1739</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281789%29">1789–1791</a>), headed by the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Princes</a> <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian of Bavaria</a> and <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Eugene of Savoy</a>, and <a href="field%20marshal">field marshal</a> <a href="Baron%20Ernst%20Gideon%20von%20Laudon">Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon</a> respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two <a href="Great%20Serbian%20Migrations">Great Serbian Migrations</a>, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two <a href="Serbian%20Patriarchs">Serbian Patriarchs</a>, retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> and <a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a>.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture, —such as mosques and bazaas, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century, several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.

During the <a href="First%20Serbian%20Uprising">First Serbian Uprising</a>, the Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the <a href="Second%20Serbian%20Uprising">Second Serbian Uprising</a> in 1815, Serbia reached semi-independence, which was formally recognized by the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Porte</a> in 1830.

The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of <a href="Neoclassicism">neoclassicist</a> and <a href="baroque">baroque</a> buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by <a href="St.%20Michael%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Belgrade">St Michael's Cathedral</a> (Serbian: "Saborna crkva)", completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an <a href="Eclecticism">eclecticist</a> style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

In 1841, Prince <a href="Mihailo%20Obrenovi%C4%87">Mihailo Obrenović</a> moved the capital of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Serbia">Principality of Serbia</a> from <a href="Kragujevac">Kragujevac</a> to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815–1839), Prince Miloš Obrenović pursued the creation of new settlements, the colonization of new population and the aim to make Belgrade a centre of administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (čaršija) was less successful. The new Abadžijska čaršija couldn't compete against the already well-established market places of the city of Belgrade. Trade was still conducted in the centuries-old Donja čaršija and Gornja čaršija. New construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters and not so much for the Muslim ones. Until 1863 the number of Belgrade quarters decreases continuously, mainly as a consequence of the reduction of Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from that year counts only 9 quarters (mahale). The names of only five are known today: Ali-pašina mahala, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pašina, Bajram-begova and Laz Hadži-Mahmudova mahala.

On 18 April 1867 the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from the <a href="Belgrade%20fortress">Belgrade fortress</a>. The only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's "de facto" independence dates from this event. The urban planner Emilijan Josimović had a significant impact on the urbanism of Belgrade in the last third of the 19th century. He conceptualised a regulation plan for Belgrade in 1867, where he proposed an alternation of the town's crooked streets with rectangular ones. Of great importance was also the construction of political and cultural institutions as well as parks. When it comes to Josimović's work, Serbian scholars have often pointed out that it represented an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul – the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia officially still belonged – at the same time underwent quite similar processes of urbanisation.

In May 1868, Prince Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin <a href="Anka%20Konstantinovi%C4%87">Anka Konstantinović</a> while riding in a carriage through the park of his country residence

With the <a href="Principality%20of%20Serbia">Principality</a>'s full independence in 1878, and its transformation into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a> in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to <a href="Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a>, Serbia's second city, and in 1900 the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Yet by 1905 the population had grown to more than 80,000, and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, not counting <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a> which then belonged to <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>.

The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade, in June 1896 by Andre Carr, a representative of the <a href="Auguste%20and%20Louis%20Lumi%C3%A8re">Lumière brothers</a>. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved.

The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian</a> <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a> shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> under General <a href="Oskar%20Potiorek">Oskar Potiorek</a> on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by <a href="Serbian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Serbian troops</a> under Marshal <a href="Radomir%20Putnik">Radomir Putnik</a>. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, between 6 and 9 October 1915, Belgrade fell to <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German</a> and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal <a href="August%20von%20Mackensen">August von Mackensen</a> on 9 October 1915. The city was liberated by Serbian and <a href="French%20Army">French troops</a> on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal <a href="Louis%20Franchet%20d%27Esp%C3%A8rey">Louis Franchet d'Espèrey</a> of France and <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a>. Since Belgrade was decimated as the front-line city, <a href="Subotica">Subotica</a> overtook the title of the largest city in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom</a> for a short while.

After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new "Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes", renamed the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> in 1929. The Kingdom was split into <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">banovinas</a>, and Belgrade, together with <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a> and <a href="Pan%C4%8Devo">Pančevo</a>, formed a separate administrative unit.

During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (incorporating the town of Zemun, formerly in Austria-Hungary), and 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year. In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The <a href="Pan%C4%8Devo%20Bridge">Pančevo Bridge</a>, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while <a href="King%20Alexander%20Bridge">King Alexander Bridge</a> over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first <a href="Belgrade%20Grand%20Prix">Belgrade Grand Prix</a>, the last <a href="Grand%20Prix%20motor%20racing">Grand Prix motor racing</a> race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Belgrade Fortress</a> and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was <a href="Tazio%20Nuvolari">Tazio Nuvolari</a>.

On 25 March 1941, the government of <a href="regent">regent</a> <a href="Prince%20Paul%20of%20Yugoslavia">Crown Prince Paul</a> signed the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>, joining the <a href="Axis%20powers%20of%20World%20War%20II">Axis powers</a> in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> led by Air Force commander General <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Simovi%C4%87">Dušan Simović</a>, who proclaimed <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Yugoslavia">King Peter II</a> to be of age to rule the realm. Consequently, the city was <a href="Bombing%20of%20Belgrade%20in%20World%20War%20II%23German%20bombing">heavily bombed</a> by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a>, <a href="Hungary%20between%20the%20two%20world%20wars">Hungarian</a>, and <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Bulgaria%20during%20World%20War%20II">Bulgarian</a> forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer <a href="Fritz%20Klingenberg">Fritz Klingenberg</a> pretending to be a larger force, accepted the surrender of the city. Belgrade was then occupied by the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> later the same month and Belgrade became the seat of the puppet <a href="Nedi%C4%87%20regime">Nedić regime</a>, headed by General <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a>.

During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Serbia">Jewish community</a> were subject to mass shootings at the order of General <a href="Franz%20B%C3%B6hme">Franz Böhme</a>, the German Military Governor of Serbia. Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major <a href="%C5%BDarko%20Todorovi%C4%87">Žarko Todorović</a> from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.

Just like <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, which was devastated twice, by both German and Allied bombing, <a href="Allied%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia%20in%20World%20War%20II%231944%20Easter%20bombing">Belgrade was bombed</a> once more during World War II, this time by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christian</a> <a href="Orthodox%20Easter">Easter</a>. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> and the Communist <a href="Partisans%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Partisans</a>. On 29 November 1945, Marshal <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> proclaimed the <a href="Federal%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> in Belgrade (later to be renamed to <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.

When the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the <a href="SFR%20Yugoslavia">renewed Yugoslavia</a>, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of <a href="New%20Belgrade">New Belgrade</a> started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Countries</a> was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, <a href="Belgrade%20Nikola%20Tesla%20Airport">Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport</a> was built. In 1968, <a href="1968%20student%20demonstrations%20in%20Belgrade">major student protests</a> led to several street clashes between students and the police.

On 9 March 1991, <a href="March%209%2C%201991%20protest">massive demonstrations</a> led by <a href="Vuk%20Dra%C5%A1kovi%C4%87">Vuk Drašković</a> were held in the city against <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a>. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. <a href="1996%E2%80%931997%20protests%20in%20Serbia">Further protests</a> were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections. These protests brought <a href="Zoran%20%C4%90in%C4%91i%C4%87">Zoran Đinđić</a> to power, the first <a href="mayor%20of%20Belgrade">mayor of Belgrade</a> since World War II who did not belong to the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">League of Communists of Yugoslavia</a> or its later offshoot, the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Party of Serbia</a>.

In 1999, during the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>, <a href="Operation%20Allied%20Force">NATO bombing</a>s caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the <a href="Radio%20Television%20of%20Serbia">RTS</a> building, several hospitals, the <a href="Hotel%20Jugoslavija">Hotel Jugoslavija</a>, the <a href="U%C5%A1%C4%87e%20Tower">Central Committee building</a>, the <a href="Avala%20Tower">Avala Tower</a>, and the <a href="NATO%20Bombing%20of%20the%20Chinese%20embassy%20in%20Belgrade">Chinese embassy</a>.

After the <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 presidential elections</a>, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the <a href="Overthrow%20of%20Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">ousting of president Milošević</a>.

In 2014, <a href="Belgrade%20Waterfront">Belgrade Waterfront</a>, an urban renewal project, has been initiated headed by the <a href="Government%20of%20Serbia">Government of Serbia</a> aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy by revitalizing the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected stretch of land on the right bank of the Sava river, between the <a href="Belgrade%20Fair">Belgrade Fair</a> and <a href="Belgrade%20Main%20railway%20station">Belgrade Main railway station</a>. Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as controversial, since there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as ots chosen architectural solutions.

The city is currently under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of <a href="New%20Belgrade">Novi Beograd</a>, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction.

Belgrade lies <a href="Above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a> and is located at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and <a href="Sava">Sava</a> rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Kalemegdan</a>, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, <a href="New%20Belgrade">New Belgrade</a> was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like <a href="Krnja%C4%8Da">Krnjača</a>, <a href="Kote%C5%BE">Kotež</a> and <a href="Bor%C4%8Da">Borča</a>, also merged with the city, while <a href="Pan%C4%8Devo">Pančevo</a>, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of , while together with its metropolitan area it covers .
On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is <a href="Torlak%20%28Belgrade%29">Torlak hill</a> at . The mountains of <a href="Avala">Avala</a> () and <a href="Kosmaj">Kosmaj</a> () lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of <a href="alluvial%20plain">alluvial plain</a>s and <a href="loam">loessial</a> <a href="plateau">plateau</a>s.

One of the characteristics of the city terrain is <a href="mass%20wasting">mass wasting</a>. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the "high risk". They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. <a href="Downhill%20creep">Downhill creep</a>s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the <a href="clay">clay</a> or <a href="loam">loam</a> soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in <a href="Karaburma">Karaburma</a>, <a href="Zvezdara">Zvezdara</a>, <a href="Vi%C5%A1njica%2C%20Serbia">Višnjica</a>, <a href="Vin%C4%8Da">Vinča</a> and <a href="Ritopek">Ritopek</a>, in the Danube valley, and <a href="Umka">Umka</a>, and especially its neighborhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire <a href="Terazijska%20Terasa">Terazije slope</a> above the Sava (Kalemegdan, <a href="Savamala">Savamala</a>), which can be seen by the inclination of the <a href="Pobednik">Pobednik</a> monument and the tower of the <a href="St.%20Michael%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Belgrade">Cathedral Church</a>, and the Voždovac section, between <a href="Banjica">Banjica</a> and <a href="Autokomanda">Autokomanda</a>.
Landslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial <a href="loess">loess</a> hills of Zemun: <a href="Gardo%C5%A1">Gardoš</a>, <a href="%C4%86ukovac">Ćukovac</a> and <a href="Kalvarija%20%28Zemun%29">Kalvarija</a>. However, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of <a href="Mirijevo">Mirijevo</a> is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.

Belgrade has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a> ("Cfa"), according to <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from in January to in July, with an annual mean of . There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above , and 95 days when the temperature is above . Belgrade receives about of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.

The highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was on 24 July 2007, while on the other end, the lowest temperature was on 10 January 1893.
Belgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.

The <a href="Belgrade%20local%20election%2C%202014">2014 Belgrade local elections</a> were won by the <a href="Serbian%20Progressive%20Party">Serbian Progressive Party</a>, which formed a ruling coalition with the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Party of Serbia</a>. These elections ended the long-time rule of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29">Democratic Party</a>, which was in power from 2004 to 2013.

As the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities – <a href="executive%20%28government%29">executive</a>, <a href="legislative">legislative</a>, <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a>, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s. This includes the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Serbia%29">National Assembly</a>, the Presidency, the <a href="Government%20of%20Serbia">Government of Serbia</a> and all the ministries, <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Serbia%29">Supreme Court of Cassation</a> and the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Serbia">Constitutional Court</a>.

The city is divided into 17 municipalities. Previously, they were classified into 10 "urban" (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 "suburban" municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns. With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Surčin) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.

Most of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and <a href="Sava">Sava</a> rivers, in the <a href="%C5%A0umadija">Šumadija</a> region. Three municipalities (<a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>, <a href="New%20Belgrade">Novi Beograd</a> ("New Belgrade"), and <a href="Sur%C4%8Din">Surčin</a>), are on the northern bank of the Sava, in the <a href="Syrmia">Syrmia</a> region, and the municipality of <a href="Palilula%20%28Belgrade%29">Palilula</a>, spanning the Danube, is in both the Šumadija and <a href="Banat">Banat</a> regions.

Being on the main route connecting Europe and Asia, numerous travelers always visited Belgrade. In the 19th century, before hotels in Belgrade were founded, various khans existed in the city. Oriental variant of the roadside inn, they provided travelers with food, drink and resting facilities. One of the largest in Belgrade at the time was the Turkish Khan (Turski han), located where the modern <a href="Studentski%20Trg%23Faculty%20of%20Philosophy%20Plateau">Faculty of Philosophy Plateau</a> is. Other well known khans were the Paranos Khan (modern <a href="Hotel%20Bristol%2C%20Belgrade">Hotel Bristol</a>), Davičo Khan, Batal Mosque Khan (<a href="House%20of%20the%20National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Serbia">House of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia</a>), etc. However, the khans lacked comfort as the visitors mostly slept on the ground, on the mats they would bring themselves. They mostly provided shelter from the rain, but not always from the wind. Because of that, certain <a href="kafana">kafana</a>s began adapting the floors above the dining areas into the rooms for the lodgers.

In 1843 in Dubrovačka Street (today Kralja Petra), reigning prince Mihajlo Obrenović built a large edifice, which became the first hotel in Belgrade, called "Kod jelena" ("Deer's") in the neighborhood of <a href="Kosan%C4%8Di%C4%87ev%20Venac">Kosančićev Venac</a>. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, but it soon became the gathering point of the wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the "Staro Zdanje", or the "Old Edifice". It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the "Staro Zdanje", numerous other hotels were soon built in the second half of the 19th century: "Nacional" and "Grand", also in Kosančićev Venac, "Srpski Kralj", "Srpska Kruna" and "<a href="Gr%C4%8Dka%20Kraljica">Grčka Kraljica</a>" near Kalemegdan, "Balkan" and "Pariz" in <a href="Terazije">Terazije</a>, "<a href="London%2C%20Belgrade">London</a>", etc.

As the Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew, so new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala hotels "Bosna" and "Bristol" were open. Other hotels included "Solun" and "Orient", which was built near the <a href="Financial%20Park">Financial Park</a>. Tourists which arrived by the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a> mostly stayed at the "Petrograd" Hotel on the <a href="Savamala%23Sava%20Square">Wilson Square</a>.

Tourist income in 2016 amounted to nearly one billion <a href="euro">euro</a>s; with a visit of almost a million registered tourists. Of those, more than 70,000 arrived by 550 river cruisers. Average annual growth is between 13% and 14%.

As of 2018, there are three officially designated <a href="camp%20grounds">camp grounds</a> in Belgrade. The oldest one is located in <a href="Batajnica">Batajnica</a>, along the Batajnica Road. Named "Dunav", it is one of the most visited campsites in the country. Second one is situated within the complex of the ethno-household "Zornić's House" in the village of <a href="Ba%C4%87evac">Baćevac</a>, while the third is located in <a href="Ripanj">Ripanj</a>, on the slopes of the Avala mountain. In 2017 some 15,000 overnights were recorded in camps.
Belgrade has a reputation for offering a vibrant nightlife; many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognizable nightlife features of Belgrade are the barges ("splav"), spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers.
Many weekend visitors—particularly from <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that of their own capitals, due to a perceived friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, and the lack of restrictive night life regulation.
Famous alternative clubs include Akademija and the <a href="Klub%20Studenata%20Tehnike%20%28KST%29">KST ("Klub Studenata Tehnike")</a>, located in the basement of the <a href="University%20of%20Belgrade%20Faculty%20of%20Electrical%20Engineering">University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering</a>. One of the most famous sites for alternative cultural happenings in the city is the SKC (Student Cultural Centre), located right across from Belgrade's highrise landmark, the <a href="Beogra%C4%91anka">Belgrade Palace tower</a>. Concerts featuring famous local and foreign bands are often held at the centre. SKC is also the site of various art exhibitions, as well as public debates and discussions.

A more traditional Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as "<a href="Starogradska%20muzika">Starogradska</a>" (roughly translated as "Old Town Music"), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in <a href="Skadarlija">Skadarlija</a>, the city's old <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade gathered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called <a href="kafana">kafana</a>s in Serbian), which date back to that period. At one end of the neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded in the first half of the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the <a href="Znak%20pitanja">Znak pitanja</a> ("?").

"<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported that Europe's best nightlife can be found in Belgrade. In the <a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a> "1000 Ultimate Experiences" guide of 2009, Belgrade was placed at the 1st spot among the top 10 party cities in the world.

There are approximately one-thousand sports facilities in Belgrade, many of which are capable of serving all levels of sporting events. Belgrade has hosted several major sporting events recently, including <a href="EuroBasket%202005">EuroBasket 2005</a>, the <a href="2005%20European%20Volleyball%20Championship">2005 European Volleyball Championship</a>, the 2006 <a href="European%20Water%20Polo%20Championship">European Water Polo Championship</a>, the <a href="European%20Youth%20Olympic%20Festival">European Youth Olympic Festival</a> 2007, and the <a href="Universiade">2009 Summer Universiade</a>.

Belgrade has two state universities and several private institutions of higher education. The <a href="University%20of%20Belgrade">University of Belgrade</a>, founded in 1808 as the "Great School" or <a href="Grandes%20%C3%A9coles">Grandes écoles</a> in French, is the oldest institution of higher learning in Serbia. Having developed with the city in the 19th century, quite a few University buildings are a constituent part of Belgrade's architecture and <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a>. With enrollment of nearly 90,000 students, the University is one of the Europe's largest.

There are also 195 primary (elementary) schools and 85 secondary schools. Of the primary schools, there are 162 regular, 14 special, 15 art, and 4 adult schools.

Belgrade has an extensive public transport system based on buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es (8 lines), <a href="S-train">S-train</a> (2 lines) and <a href="Beovoz">Beovoz</a> <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter rail</a> (6 lines). Buses, trolleybuses and trams are run by <a href="GSP%20Beograd">GSP Beograd</a> and <a href="Lasta%20Beograd">SP Lasta</a>, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The <a href="S-train">S-train</a> network, <a href="BG%20Voz">BG Voz</a>, run by city government in cooperation with <a href="Serbian%20Railways">Serbian Railways</a>, is a part of the integrated transport system, and currently has two lines (Batajnica-Ovča and Belgrade-centre-Resnik). The <a href="BusPlus">BusPlus</a> ticketing system based on <a href="contactless%20smart%20card">contactless smart card</a>s began operating in February 2012. Daily connections link the capital to other towns in Serbia and many other European destinations through the <a href="Belgrade%20Bus%20Station">central bus station</a>.

<a href="Beovoz">Beovoz</a> was the <a href="regional%20rail">suburban/commuter railway</a> network that provided <a href="mass-transit">mass-transit</a> services in the city, similar to Paris's <a href="R%C3%A9seau%20Express%20R%C3%A9gional">RER</a> and Toronto's <a href="GO%20Transit">GO Transit</a>. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by <a href="Serbian%20Railways">Serbian Railways</a>. However, this system was abolished back in 2013, mostly due to introduction of more efficient BG Voz. Belgrade is one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro or subway or other <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system. <a href="Belgrade%20Metro">Belgrade Metro</a> is in planning.
<a href="Belgrade%20Main%20railway%20station">The main railway station</a> is the main hub for international trains, while the new and (at the present moment unfinished) <a href="Belgrade%20Centre%20railway%20station">Belgrade Centre railway station</a> is used as a terminus for most national intercity trains.
The city is placed along the <a href="Pan-European%20corridors">Pan-European corridors</a> <a href="Pan-European%20Corridor%20X">X</a> and VII.

Further, an "inner magistral semi-ring" is almost done and include a new <a href="Ada%20Bridge">Ada Bridge</a> across the Sava river and <a href="Pupin%20Bridge">Pupin Bridge</a> across Danube river, which eased <a href="commuting">commuting</a> within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge traffic.
The <a href="Port%20of%20Belgrade">Port of Belgrade</a> is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river. The city is also served by <a href="Belgrade%20Nikola%20Tesla%20Airport">Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport</a>, west of the city centre, near <a href="Sur%C4%8Din">Surčin</a>. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s. Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005, over 2.6 million passengers in 2008, reaching over 3 million passengers. All-time peak, with over 4 million passengers, was accomplished in 2014, when Belgrade <a href="Nikola%20Tesla%20Airport">Nikola Tesla Airport</a> became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe.

Tourette syndrome

Tourette syndrome (TS or simply Tourette's) is a common <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor <a href="tic">tic</a>s and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a>.
Tourette's is defined as part of a <a href="spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a> of <a href="tic%20disorder">tic disorder</a>s, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.
In most cases, medication for tics is not necessary. Education is an important part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in <a href="tertiary%20care">specialty clinics</a>, <a href="attention-deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD) and <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.
About 1% of school-age children and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre <a href="syndrome">syndrome</a>, most often associated with <a href="coprolalia">coprolalia</a> (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette's. The condition was named by <a href="Jean-Martin%20Charcot">Jean-Martin Charcot</a> (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, <a href="Georges%20Gilles%20de%20la%20Tourette">Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette</a> (1857–1904), a French physician and <a href="neurology">neurologist</a>, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.

<a href="Tic">Tic</a>s are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) that involve discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.

Tourette's was classified by the fourth version of the "<a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>" (<a href="DSM-IV-TR">DSM-IV-TR</a>) as one of several <a href="tic%20disorder">tic disorder</a>s "usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence" according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorders consisted of multiple motor tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months. Chronic tic disorder was either single or multiple, motor or phonic tics (but not both), which were present for more than a year. Tourette's is diagnosed when multiple motor tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year. The fifth version of the DSM (<a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>), published in May 2013, reclassified Tourette's and tic disorders as <a href="motor%20disorder">motor disorder</a>s listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category, and replaced transient tic disorder with provisional tic disorder, but made few other significant changes.

Tic disorders are defined only slightly differently by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a>; code F95.2 is for combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [de la Tourette].

Although Tourette's is the more severe expression of the <a href="spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a> of tic disorders, most cases are mild and many individuals with TS do not come to clinical attention. The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette's, and mild cases may be undetected.

Tics are movements or sounds "that occur intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity", having the appearance of "normal behaviors gone wrong". The tics associated with Tourette's change in number, frequency, severity and anatomical location. Waxing and waning—the ongoing increase and decrease in severity and frequency of tics—occurs differently in each individual. Tics may also occur in "bouts of bouts", which vary for each person.

<a href="Coprolalia">Coprolalia</a> (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. <a href="Echolalia">Echolalia</a> (repeating the words of others) and <a href="palilalia">palilalia</a> (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.

In contrast to the abnormal movements of other <a href="movement%20disorder">movement disorder</a>s (for example, <a href="chorea%20%28disease%29">choreas</a>, <a href="dystonia">dystonia</a>s, <a href="myoclonus">myoclonus</a>, and <a href="dyskinesia">dyskinesia</a>s), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible, nonrhythmic, and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge. Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette's are aware of an urge, similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they consciously choose to release, as if they "had to do it" to relieve the sensation or until it feels "just right". Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as "premonitory <a href="sensory%20phenomena">sensory phenomena</a>" or premonitory urges. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or ""unvoluntary"", rather than specifically "involuntary"; they may be experienced as a "voluntary", suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core <a href="symptom">symptom</a> of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.
While individuals with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so often results in tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or there may be a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.

Although there is no such thing as a "typical" case of Tourette syndrome, the condition follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven. A 1998 study published by <a href="James%20F.%20Leckman">Leckman</a> and colleagues from the <a href="Yale%20Child%20Study%20Center">Yale Child Study Center</a> showed that the ages of highest tic severity are eight to twelve (average ten), with tics steadily declining for most patients as they pass through adolescence. The most common, first-presenting tics are eye blinking, facial movements, sniffing and throat clearing. Initial tics present most frequently in midline body regions where there are many muscles, usually the head, neck and facial region. This can be contrasted with the stereotyped movements of other disorders (such as <a href="stimming">stims</a> and <a href="stereotypy%20%28psychiatry%29">stereotypies</a> of the <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a>s), which typically have an earlier age of onset, are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral, and involve the extremities (e.g., flapping the hands). Tics that appear early in the course of the condition are frequently confused with other conditions, such as <a href="allergies">allergies</a>, <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, and vision problems: pediatricians, allergists and ophthalmologists are typically the first to see a child with tics.

Most cases of Tourette's in older individuals are mild and almost unrecognizable. Adults with TS presenting in clinics are atypical and represent a biased sample. When symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics, <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) and <a href="attention-deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD) are often associated with Tourette's. In children with tics, the additional presence of ADHD is associated with functional impairment, disruptive behavior, and tic severity. Compulsions resembling tics are present in some individuals with OCD; "tic-related OCD" is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD, distinguished from non-tic related OCD by the type and nature of obsessions and compulsions. Not all persons with Tourette's have ADHD or OCD or other <a href="comorbid">comorbid</a> conditions, although in clinical populations, a high percentage of patients presenting for care do have ADHD. One author reports that a ten-year overview of patient records revealed about 40% of people with Tourette's have "TS-only" or "pure TS", referring to Tourette syndrome in the absence of ADHD, OCD and other disorders. Another author reports that 57% of 656 patients presenting with tic disorders had uncomplicated tics, while 43% had tics plus comorbid conditions. People with "full-blown Tourette's" have significant comorbid conditions in addition to tics.

The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. <a href="Genetic%20epidemiology">Genetic epidemiology</a> studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as "<a href="tourettism">tourettism</a>".

A person with Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one of his or her children, but Tourette's is a condition of <a href="Expressivity%20%28genetics%29">variable expression</a> and <a href="penetrance">incomplete penetrance</a>. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.

Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> factors—while not causing Tourette's—can influence its severity. <a href="Autoimmune">Autoimmune</a> processes may affect tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a team at the US <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health">National Institute of Mental Health</a> proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a <a href="streptococcus">poststreptococcal</a> autoimmune process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (<a href="PANDAS">PANDAS</a>). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven. 

Some forms of OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette's. A subset of OCD is thought to be causally related to Tourette's and may be a different expression of the same factors that are important for the expression of tics. The genetic relationship of ADHD to Tourette syndrome, however, has not been fully established.

The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette's has not been established, and the precise cause is unknown. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical regions, the <a href="Human%20thalamus">thalamus</a>, <a href="basal%20ganglia">basal ganglia</a> and <a href="frontal%20lobe">frontal cortex</a>. <a href="Neuroanatomy">Neuroanatomic</a> models implicate failures in circuits connecting the brain's cortex and subcortex, and <a href="Neuroimaging">imaging techniques</a> implicate the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. After 2010, the role of <a href="histamine">histamine</a> and the <a href="Histamine%20H3%20receptor">H3-receptor</a> came into focus in the pathophysiology of TS, as "key modulators of striatal circuitry". A reduced level of histamine in the H3-receptor may disrupt other neurotransmitters, causing tics.

According to the fifth edition of the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (<a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>), Tourette’s may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred before the age of 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as <a href="autism%20spectrum">autism</a> or other causes of <a href="tourettism">tourettism</a>—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.

There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.

The diagnosis is made based on observation of the individual's symptoms and family history, and after ruling out <a href="tourettism">secondary causes of tic disorders.</a> In patients with a typical onset and a family history of tics or obsessive–compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.

There is no requirement that other <a href="comorbid">comorbid</a> conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, but if a physician believes that there may be another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and <a href="seizure">seizure</a> activity exists, which would call for an <a href="Electroencephalography">EEG</a>, or if there are symptoms that indicate an <a href="MRI">MRI</a> to rule out brain abnormalities. <a href="Thyroid-stimulating%20hormone">TSH</a> levels can be measured to rule out <a href="hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</a>, which can be a cause of tics. <a href="Brain%20imaging">Brain imaging</a> studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a <a href="urine%20drug%20screen">urine drug screen</a> for <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="stimulants">stimulants</a> might be necessary. If a family history of <a href="liver%20disease">liver disease</a> is present, serum copper and <a href="ceruloplasmin">ceruloplasmin</a> levels can rule out <a href="Wilson%27s%20disease">Wilson's disease</a>. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.

Secondary causes of tics (not related to inherited Tourette syndrome) are commonly referred to as <a href="tourettism">tourettism</a>. <a href="Dystonia">Dystonia</a>s, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include <a href="developmental%20disorder">developmental disorder</a>s, <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a>s, and <a href="stereotypic%20movement%20disorder">stereotypic movement disorder</a>; <a href="Sydenham%27s%20chorea">Sydenham's chorea</a>; <a href="idiopathic">idiopathic</a> dystonia; and genetic conditions such as <a href="Huntington%27s%20disease">Huntington's disease</a>, <a href="neuroacanthocytosis">neuroacanthocytosis</a>, <a href="pantothenate%20kinase-associated%20neurodegeneration">pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration</a>, <a href="Duchenne%20muscular%20dystrophy">Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a>, Wilson's disease, and <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>, <a href="Klinefelter%20syndrome">Klinefelter syndrome</a>, <a href="XYY%20syndrome">XYY syndrome</a> and <a href="fragile%20X%20syndrome">fragile X syndrome</a>. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a>, <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, and <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a>. The symptoms of <a href="Lesch-Nyhan%20syndrome">Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</a> may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.

Although not all people with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's patients presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), <a href="learning%20disabilities">learning disabilities</a> and <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disorder</a>s. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may be accounted for by the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD do not appear to be associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.

Because comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics. "It is critical to note that the comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder," according to Samuel Zinner, MD. The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD. Undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in functional impairment, and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning. Complications may include <a href="clinical%20depression">depression</a>, <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep problems</a>, social discomfort, <a href="self-harm">self-injury</a>, <a href="Anxiety%20disorder">anxiety</a>, <a href="personality%20disorder">personality disorder</a>s, <a href="oppositional%20defiant%20disorder">oppositional defiant disorder</a>, and <a href="conduct%20disorder">conduct disorder</a>s.

The treatment of Tourette's focuses on identifying and helping the individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require <a href="Pharmacology">pharmacological</a> treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, can be divided into those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.

There is no cure for Tourette's and no medication that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, <a href="behavior">behavior</a>al and <a href="psychology">psychological</a> therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or <a href="cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>) may help to avoid or ameliorate <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.
Medication is available to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—<a href="Typical%20antipsychotics">typical</a> and <a href="Atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical</a> <a href="Antipsychotic">neuroleptics</a> including <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> (trade name Risperdal), <a href="ziprasidone">ziprasidone</a> (Geodon), <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a> (Haldol), <a href="pimozide">pimozide</a> (Orap) and <a href="fluphenazine">fluphenazine</a> (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term <a href="Adverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29">adverse effects</a>. The <a href="antihypertensive">antihypertensive</a> agents <a href="clonidine">clonidine</a> (trade name Catapres) and <a href="guanfacine">guanfacine</a> (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. <a href="Stimulants">Stimulants</a> and other medications may be useful in <a href="Treatment%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome%23Treatment%20of%20ADHD%20in%20the%20presence%20of%20tic%20disorders">treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders.</a> Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), <a href="atomoxetine">atomoxetine</a> (Strattera) and <a href="tricyclic%20antidepressant">tricyclic antidepressant</a>s. <a href="Clomipramine">Clomipramine</a> (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">SSRIs</a>—a class of <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s including <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a> (Prozac), <a href="sertraline">sertraline</a> (Zoloft), and <a href="fluvoxamine">fluvoxamine</a> (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.

Because children with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, and because of the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often. Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms: it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.

<a href="Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT) is a useful treatment when OCD is present, and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of <a href="Habit%20reversal%20training">habit reversal</a> (HRT) in the treatment of tics. There is evidence that HRT reduces tic severity, but there are methodological limitations in the studies, and a need for more trained specialists and better large-scale studies.

<a href="Relaxation%20technique">Relaxation technique</a>s, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may be useful in relieving the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and <a href="biofeedback">biofeedback</a>, with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's. <a href="Deep%20brain%20stimulation">Deep brain stimulation</a> has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.

Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The majority of cases are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, to the extent that casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.

Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette's have a normal <a href="Life%20expectancy">life span</a>. Although the symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, the condition is not <a href="Degeneration%20%28medical%29">degenerative</a> or life-threatening. <a href="intelligence%20%28trait%29">Intelligence</a> is normal in those with Tourette's, although there may be learning disabilities. Severity of tics early in life does not predict tic severity in later life, and prognosis is generally favorable, although there is no reliable means of predicting the outcome for a particular individual. The gene or genes associated with Tourette's have not been identified, and there is no potential "cure". A higher rate of <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s than the general population and <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disturbances</a> are reported.

Several studies have demonstrated that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.
Many people with TS may not realize they have tics; because tics are more commonly expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It is not uncommon for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.

Children with Tourette's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as "bizarre". If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> or school accommodations can be helpful. Because <a href="comorbid">comorbid</a> conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics, a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant.

A supportive environment and family generally gives those with Tourette's the skills to manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome%23Notable%20individuals">Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals</a> from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.

Tourette syndrome is found among all social, racial and ethnic groups and has been reported in all parts of the world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.

Up to 1% of the overall population experiences <a href="tic%20disorder">tic disorder</a>s, including chronic tics and transient tics of childhood. Chronic tics affect 5% of children, and transient tics affect up to 20%. Prevalence rates in special education populations are higher.

The reported prevalence of TS varies "according to the source, age, and sex of the sample; the ascertainment procedures; and diagnostic system", with a range reported between .4% and 3.8% for children ages 5 to 18. Robertson (2011) says that 1% of school-age children have Tourette's. According to Lombroso and Scahill (2008), the emerging consensus is that .1 to 1% of children have Tourette's, with several studies supporting a tighter range of .6 to .8%. Bloch and Leckman (2009) and Swain (2007) report a range of prevalence in children of .4 to .6%, Knight et al. (2012) estimate .77% in children, and Du et al. (2010) report that 1 to 3% of "Western" school-age children have Tourette's.

Singer (2011) states the prevalence of TS in the overall population at any time is .1% for impairing cases and .6% for all cases, while Bloch and colleagues (2011) state the overall prevalence as between .3 and 1%. Robertson (2011) also suggests that the rate of Tourette's in the general population is 1%. Using year 2000 census data, a prevalence range of .1 to 1% yields an estimate of 53,000–530,000 school-age children with Tourette's in the US, and a prevalence estimate of .1% means that in 2001 about 553,000 people in the UK age 5 or older would have Tourette's.

Tourette syndrome was once thought to be rare: in 1972, the US <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States, and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. However, multiple studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher than previously thought. Discrepancies across current and prior prevalence estimates come from several factors: ascertainment bias in earlier <a href="Sampling%20%28statistics%29">samples</a> drawn from clinically referred cases, assessment methods that may fail to detect milder cases, and differences in diagnostic criteria and thresholds. There were few broad-based community studies published before 2000 and until the 1980s, most epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome were based on individuals referred to <a href="tertiary%20care">tertiary care</a> or specialty clinics. Individuals with mild symptoms may not seek treatment and physicians may not confer an official diagnosis of TS on children out of concern for stigmatization; children with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics, so prevalence studies have an inherent <a href="biased%20sample">bias</a> towards more severe cases. Studies of Tourette syndrome are vulnerable to error because tics vary in intensity and <a href="Penetrance">expression</a>, are often intermittent, and are not always recognized by clinicians, patients, family members, friends or teachers; approximately 20% of persons with Tourette syndrome do not recognize that they have tics. Newer studies—recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect—use direct classroom observation and multiple informants (parent, teacher, and trained observers), and therefore record more cases than older studies relying on referrals. As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases, the result is an increase in estimated prevalence.

Tourette's is associated with several comorbid conditions, or co-occurring diagnoses, which are often the major source of impairment for an affected child. Most individuals with tics do not seek medical attention, so <a href="Epidemiological%20study">epidemiological studies</a> of TS "reflect a strong <a href="ascertainment%20bias">ascertainment bias</a>", but among those who do warrant medical attention, the majority have other conditions, and up to 50% have ADHD or OCD.

The first presentation of Tourette syndrome is thought to be in the book, "<a href="Malleus%20Maleficarum">Malleus Maleficarum</a>" ("Witch's hammer") by Jakob Sprenger and Heinrich Kraemer, published in the late 15th century and describing a priest whose tics were "believed to be related to possession by the devil". A French doctor, <a href="Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard">Jean Marc Gaspard Itard</a>, reported the first case of Tourette syndrome in 1825, describing Marquise de Dampierre, an important woman of nobility in her time. Jean-Martin Charcot, an influential French physician, assigned his resident Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, a French physician and neurologist, to study patients at the <a href="Piti%C3%A9-Salp%C3%AAtri%C3%A8re%20Hospital">Salpêtrière</a> Hospital, with the goal of defining an illness distinct from <a href="hysteria">hysteria</a> and from <a href="Chorea%20%28disease%29">chorea</a>.
In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette published an account in "Study of a Nervous Affliction" describing nine persons with "convulsive tic disorder", concluding that a new clinical category should be defined. The eponym was later bestowed by Charcot after and on behalf of Gilles de la Tourette.

Little progress was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an <a href="organic%20disease">organic origin</a> was raised when an <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a> <a href="epidemic">epidemic</a> from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.

During the 1960s and 1970s, as the beneficial effects of <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a> (Haldol) on tics became known, the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned. The turning point came in 1965, when <a href="Arthur%20K.%20Shapiro">Arthur K. Shapiro</a>—described as "the father of modern tic disorder research"—treated a Tourette’s patient with haloperidol, and published a paper criticizing the psychoanalytic approach.

Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, in which biological vulnerability and adverse environmental events are seen to interact. In 2000, the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.

Findings since 1999 have advanced TS science in the areas of genetics, <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="neurophysiology">neurophysiology</a>, and <a href="neuropathology">neuropathology</a>. Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome, and how closely Tourette's is related to other movement disorders or <a href="psychiatry">psychiatric</a> disorders. Good <a href="epidemiologic">epidemiologic</a> data is still lacking, and <a href="Treatment%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome">available treatments</a> are not risk free and not always well tolerated. High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as <a href="deep%20brain%20stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a>, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.

Not everyone with Tourette's wants treatment or a "cure", especially if that means they may "lose" something else in the process. Researchers Leckman and <a href="Donald%20J.%20Cohen">Cohen</a>, and former US <a href="Tourette%20Association%20of%20America">Tourette Syndrome Association</a> (TSA) national board member Kathryn Taubert, believe that there may be latent advantages associated with an individual's genetic vulnerability to developing Tourette syndrome, such as a heightened awareness and increased attention to detail and surroundings that may have adaptive value. There is evidence to support the clinical lore that children with "TS-only" (Tourette's in the absence of <a href="comorbid">comorbid</a> conditions) are unusually gifted: neuropsychological studies have identified advantages in children with TS-only. Children with TS-only are faster than the average for their age group on timed tests of <a href="motor%20coordination">motor coordination</a>.
<a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome%23Notable%20individuals">Notable individuals with Tourette syndrome</a> are found in all walks of life, including musicians, athletes, media figures, teachers, physicians, and authors. The best-known example of a person who may have used obsessive–compulsive traits to advantage is <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, the 18th-century English man of letters, who likely had Tourette syndrome as evidenced by the writings of <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a>. Johnson wrote "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">A Dictionary of the English Language</a>" in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic. <a href="Tim%20Howard">Tim Howard</a>, described by the "Chicago Tribune" as the "rarest of creatures – an American soccer hero" and by the TSA as the "most notable individual with Tourette Syndrome around the world" says that his neurological makeup gave him an enhanced perception and an ability to hyper-focus that contributed to his success on the field.

Although it has been <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome%23Speculation%20about%20notable%20individuals">speculated that Mozart had Tourette's</a>, no Tourette's expert or organization has presented credible evidence to support such a conclusion, and there are problems with the arguments supporting the diagnosis: tics are not transferred to the written form, as is supposed with Mozart's scatological writings; the medical history in retrospect is not thorough; side effects due to other conditions may be misinterpreted; "it is not proven whether written documents can account for the existence of a vocal tic" and "the evidence of motor tics in Mozart's life is doubtful."
Pre-dating Gilles de la Tourette's 1885 publication, likely portrayals of TS or tic disorders in fictional literature are Mr. Pancks in "<a href="Little%20Dorrit">Little Dorrit</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and Nikolai Levin in "<a href="Anna%20Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>" by <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>. The entertainment industry has been criticized for <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20Tourette%20syndrome%23References%20in%20the%20entertainment%20industry">depicting those with Tourette syndrome</a> as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and in the British media.

Anne of Denmark (; 12 December 1574 – 2 March 1619) was <a href="Queen%20consort">Queen consort</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> by marriage to <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James VI and I</a>.

The second daughter of King <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Denmark">Frederick II of Denmark</a>, Anne married James in 1589 at age 15 and bore him three children who survived infancy, including the future <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. She demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Henry</a> and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.

In England, Anne shifted her energies from factional politics to patronage of the arts and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a> in Europe. After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have been a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> at the time of her death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> sometime in her life.

Historians have traditionally dismissed Anne as a lightweight queen, frivolous and self-indulgent. However, recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne's assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a patron of the arts during the <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobean age</a>.

Anne was born on 12 December 1574 at the castle of <a href="Skanderborg">Skanderborg</a> on the <a href="Jutland%20Peninsula">Jutland Peninsula</a> in the <a href="Denmark%E2%80%93Norway">Kingdom of Denmark</a>. Her birth came as a blow to her father, King <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Denmark">Frederick II of Denmark</a>, who was desperately hoping for a son. But her mother, <a href="Sophie%20of%20Mecklenburg-G%C3%BCstrow">Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow</a>, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future <a href="Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Christian IV of Denmark</a>.

With her older sister, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Denmark%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Brunswick">Elizabeth</a>, Anne was sent to be raised at <a href="G%C3%BCstrow">Güstrow</a> by her maternal grandparents, the <a href="Ulrich%20III%20of%20Mecklenburg-G%C3%BCstrow">Duke</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Denmark%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Mecklenburg">Duchess of Mecklenburg</a>. Compared with the roving Danish court, where King Frederick was notorious for gargantuan meals, heavy drinking and restless behaviour (including marital infidelity), Güstrow provided Anne with a frugal and stable life during her early childhood. Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow but two years later, in 1579, the <a href="Rigsraadet">Rigsraad</a> (Danish Privy Council) successfully requested his removal to Denmark, and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.

Anne enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself. Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including <a href="James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a>, who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.

James' other serious possibility, though 8 years his senior, was <a href="Catherine%20of%20Navarre%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Lorraine">Catherine</a>, sister of the <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20Navarre">Henry III of Navarre</a> (future Henry IV of France), who was favoured by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>. Scottish ambassadors had at first concentrated their suit on the oldest daughter, but Frederick betrothed Elizabeth to <a href="Henry%20Julius%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick</a>, promising the Scots instead that "for the second [daughter] Anna, if the King did like her, he should have her."

The constitutional position of Sophie, Anne's mother, became difficult after Frederick's death in 1588, when she found herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the <a href="dowry">dowry</a> and the status of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, she sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne herself seems to have been thrilled with the match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy <a href="Thomas%20Fowler%20%28courtier%29">Thomas Fowler</a> reported that Anne was "so far in love with the King's Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt in no way to requite." Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fiancé while three hundred tailors worked on her wedding dress.

Whatever the truth of the rumours, James required a royal match to preserve the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuart</a> line. "God is my witness", he explained, "I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were a barren stock." On 20 August 1589, Anne was <a href="Proxy%20marriage">married by proxy</a> to James at <a href="Kronborg%20Castle">Kronborg Castle</a>, the ceremony ending with James' representative, <a href="George%20Keith%2C%205th%20Earl%20Marischal">George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal</a>, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.

Anne set sail for Scotland within 10 days, but her fleet was beset by a series of misadventures, finally being forced back to the coast of <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, from where she travelled by land to <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> for refuge, accompanied by the Earl Marischal and others of the Scottish and Danish embassies.

On 12 September, Lord Dingwall had landed at <a href="Leith">Leith</a>, reporting that "he had come in company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas." Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, kept watch on the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> for Anne's arrival, wrote several songs, one comparing the situation to the plight of <a href="Hero%20and%20Leander">Hero and Leander</a>, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: "Only to one who knows me as well as his own reflection in a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked ...". Informed in October that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, and in what Willson calls "the one romantic episode of his life", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally, arriving in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from <a href="Flekkefjord">Flekkefjord</a> via <a href="T%C3%B8nsberg">Tønsberg</a>. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, "with boots and all", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.

Anne and James were formally married at the <a href="Old%20Bishop%27s%20Palace%20in%20Oslo">Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo</a> on 23 November 1589, "with all the splendour possible at that time and place." So that both bride and groom could understand, Leith minister David Lindsay conducted the ceremony in French, describing Anne as "a Princess both godly and beautiful ... she giveth great contentment to his Majesty." A month of celebrations followed; and on 22 December, cutting his entourage to fifty, James visited his new relations at <a href="Kronborg%20Castle">Kronborg Castle</a> in <a href="Elsinore">Elsinore</a>, where the newlyweds were greeted by Queen Sophie, twelve-year-old <a href="Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark">King Christian IV</a>, and Christian's four regents. The couple moved on to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> on 7 March and attended the wedding of Anne's older sister Elizabeth to <a href="Henry%20Julius%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick</a>, sailing two days later for Scotland in a patched up "Gideon". They arrived in the <a href="Water%20of%20Leith">Water of Leith</a> on 1 May. After a welcoming speech in French by <a href="James%20Elphinstone%2C%201st%20Lord%20Balmerino">James Elphinstone</a>, Anne stayed in the <a href="John%20Chisholm%20%28soldier%29">King's Wark</a> and James went alone to hear a sermon by <a href="Patrick%20Galloway">Patrick Galloway</a> in the <a href="South%20Leith%20Parish%20Church">Parish Church</a>. Five days later, Anne made her state entry into Edinburgh in a solid silver coach brought over from Denmark, James riding alongside on horseback.

Anne was crowned on 17 May 1590 in the <a href="Holyrood%20Abbey">Abbey Church</a> at <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood</a>, the first Protestant coronation in Scotland. During the seven-hour ceremony, her gown was opened by the <a href="Countess%20of%20Mar">Countess of Mar</a> for presiding minister Robert Bruce to pour "a bonny quantity of oil" on "parts of her breast and arm", so anointing her as queen. (<a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Kirk</a> ministers had objected vehemently to this element of the ceremony as a <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> and <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> ritual, but James insisted that it dated from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>.) The king handed the crown to Chancellor Maitland, who placed it on Anne's head. She then affirmed an oath to defend the true religion and worship of God and to "withstand and despise all <a href="papist">papist</a>ical superstitions, and whatsoever ceremonies and rites contrary to the word of God".

By all accounts, James was at first entranced by his bride, but his infatuation evaporated quickly and the couple often found themselves at loggerheads, though in the early years of their marriage James seems always to have treated Anne with patience and affection. Between 1593 and 1595, James was romantically linked with <a href="Anne%20Lyon%2C%20Countess%20of%20Kinghorne">Anne Murray</a>, later Lady Glamis, whom he addressed in verse as "my mistress and my love"; and Anne herself was also occasionally the subject of scandalous rumours. In "<a href="Basilikon%20Doron">Basilikon Doron</a>", written 1597–1598, James described marriage as "the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can come to a man".

From the first moment of the marriage, Anne was under pressure to provide James and Scotland with an heir, but the passing of 1591 and 1592 with no sign of a pregnancy provoked renewed Presbyterian libels on the theme of James' fondness for male company and whispers against Anne "for that she proves not with child". As a result, there was great public relief when on 19 February 1594 Anne gave birth to her first child, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick</a>.

Anne soon learned that she would have no say in her son's care. James appointed as head of the nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James' own oak cradle. Most distressingly for Anne, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of <a href="John%20Erskine%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mar%20%281558%E2%80%931634%29">John Erskine</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Mar">Earl of Mar</a> at <a href="Stirling%20Castle">Stirling Castle</a>, in keeping with Scottish royal tradition.

In late 1594, she began a furious campaign for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, <a href="John%20Maitland%2C%201st%20Lord%20Maitland%20of%20Thirlestane">John Maitland of Thirlestane</a>. Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from his own mouth, "because in the surety of my son consists my surety", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even in the event of his own death. Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it. After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue, Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage. Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, <a href="John%20Colville%20%28c.%201540%E2%80%931605%29">John Colville</a> wrote: "There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other." Nevertheless, the Queen had six more children by James.

Anne saw a belated opportunity to gain custody of Henry in 1603 when James left for London with the Earl of Mar to assume the English throne following the death of <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a>. Pregnant at the time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of "well-supported" nobles, intent on removing the nine-year-old Henry, whom she had hardly seen for five years; but <a href="Marie%20Stewart%2C%20Countess%20of%20Mar">Mar's wife</a> and son would allow her to bring no more than two attendants with her into the castle. The obduracy of Henry's keepers sent Anne into such a fury that she suffered another miscarriage: according to <a href="David%20Calderwood">David Calderwood</a>, she "went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of May."

When the Earl of Mar returned with James' instructions that Anne join him in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>, she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry. This "forceful maternal action", as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for "<a href="wikt%3Afroward">froward</a> womanly apprehensions" and described her behaviour in a letter to Mar as "wilfulness". After a brief convalescence from the <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>, Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry, their progress causing a sensation in England. <a href="Lady%20Anne%20Clifford">Lady Anne Clifford</a> recorded that she and her mother killed three horses in their haste to see the Queen, and that when James met Anne near <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor</a>, "there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court as I think I shall never see the like again."

Observers regularly noted incidents of marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called <a href="Gowrie%20conspiracy">Gowrie conspiracy</a> of 1600, in which the young <a href="John%20Ruthven%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Gowrie">Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven</a>, and his brother <a href="Alexander%20Ruthven">Alexander Ruthven</a> were killed by James' attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were "in chiefest credit." The Queen, who was five months pregnant, refused to get out of bed unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated her because she was not the Earl of Gowrie. James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue. In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household; in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of £200.

In 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that "his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously." In turn, Anne took exception to James' drinking: in 1604 she confided to the French envoy that "the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result."

A briefer confrontation occurred in 1613 when Anne shot and killed James' favourite dog during a hunting session. After his initial rage, James smoothed things over by giving her a £2,000 diamond in memory of the dog, whose name was Jewel.

In London, Anne adopted a cosmopolitan lifestyle, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in <a href="Royston%2C%20Hertfordshire">Royston</a>. Anne's chaplain, <a href="Godfrey%20Goodman">Godfrey Goodman</a>, later summed up the royal relationship: "The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him <a href="wikt%3Auxorious">uxorious</a>; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together." Anne moved into <a href="Greenwich%20Palace">Greenwich Palace</a> and then <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a>, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together, by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne's decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.

The death of their son Henry in 1612 at the age of eighteen, probably from <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a>, and the departure for <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> of their daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a> in April 1613, after marrying <a href="Frederick%20V%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Frederick V, Elector Palatine</a>, further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James. Henry's death hit Anne particularly hard; the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her "because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs". From this time forward, Anne's health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known <a href="masque">masque</a> in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court. Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.

Although James had always adopted male <a href="favourite">favourite</a>s among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of her husband's English reign, <a href="Robert%20Carr%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Somerset">Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset</a>, and <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">George Villiers</a>, the future Duke of Buckingham. She detested Carr, but she encouraged the rise of Villiers, whom James knighted in her bedchamber; and she developed friendly relations with him, calling him her "dog". Even so, Anne found herself increasingly ignored after Buckingham's rise and became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.

A further source of difference between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, but she may have discreetly converted to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish <a href="Kirk">Kirk</a> and caused suspicion in Anglican England.

Queen Elizabeth had certainly been worried about the possibility and sent messages to Anne warning her not to listen to <a href="papist">papist</a> counsellors and requesting the names of anyone who had tried to convert her; Anne had replied that there was no need to name names because any such efforts had failed. Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping Henrietta Gordon, wife of the exiled Catholic <a href="George%20Gordon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Huntly">George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly</a>, as a confidante; after Huntly's return in 1596, the <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> minister David Black called Anne an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> and remarked in a sermon that "the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped."

When former intelligencer Sir Anthony Standen was discovered bringing Anne a rosary from <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VIII">Pope Clement VIII</a> in 1603, James imprisoned him in the Tower for ten months. Anne protested her annoyance at the gift, but eventually secured Standen's release.

Like James, Anne later supported a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence with the potential bride, <a href="Maria%20Anna%20of%20Spain">the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna</a>, included a request that two <a href="friar">friar</a>s be sent to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to pray for her and the King. The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a> advised a nuncio: "Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that she might be a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement."

In Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited court factionalism for her own ends, in particular by supporting the enemies of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Mar">Earl of Mar</a>. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. <a href="Henry%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">Henry Howard</a>, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, <a href="Eve%23Eve%20in%20Christianity">Eve</a> was corrupted by the <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">serpent</a>. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends.

In England, Anne largely turned from political to social and artistic activities. Though she participated fully in the life of James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuart dynasty</a> and its <a href="House%20of%20Oldenburg">Danish connections</a>.

The <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> envoy, Nicolo Molin, wrote this description of Anne in 1606: 

Anne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasised her triviality and extravagance. Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th century, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court the origins of the <a href="English%20civil%20war">English civil war</a>. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: "Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife." The 19th-century biographer <a href="Agnes%20Strickland">Agnes Strickland</a> condemned Anne's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: "It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she ... preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare."

However, the reassessment of James in the past two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least for as long as the royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.

Anne shared with James the fault of extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her considerable dowry. She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobean</a> London, where she created a "rich and hospitable" cultural climate at the royal court, became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish <a href="masque">masque</a>s. <a href="Walter%20Cope">Sir Walter Cope</a>, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother <a href="Ulrik%20of%20Denmark%20%281578%E2%80%931624%29">Ulrik of Holstein</a>'s visit, wrote, "Burbage is come and says there is no new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called "<a href="Love%27s%20Labour%27s%20Lost">Love's Labour's Lost</a>" which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly." Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle, were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that "in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches".

Anne's masques were responsible for almost all the courtly female performance in the first two decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In "<a href="The%20Vision%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Goddesses">The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses</a>" of 1604, she played <a href="Athena">Pallas Athena</a>, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in "<a href="The%20Masque%20of%20Blackness">The Masque of Blackness</a>" of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as "blackamores". Letter writer <a href="Dudley%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dorchester">Dudley Carleton</a> reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand "though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips". Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> and <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>.

Jones, a gifted architect steeped in the latest European taste, also designed the <a href="Queen%27s%20House">Queen's House</a> at Greenwich for Anne, one of the first true <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> buildings in England; and the Dutch inventor <a href="Salomon%20de%20Caus">Salomon de Caus</a> laid out her gardens at Greenwich and Somerset House. Anne particularly loved music and patronised the lutenist and composer <a href="John%20Dowland">John Dowland</a>, previously employed at her brother's court in Denmark, as well as "more than a good many" French musicians.

Anne also commissioned artists such as <a href="Paul%20van%20Somer%20I">Paul van Somer</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Oliver">Isaac Oliver</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Mytens">Daniel Mytens</a>, who led English taste in visual arts for a generation. Under Anne, the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a> began once more to expand, a policy continued by Anne's son, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles</a>. Historian Alan Stewart suggests that many of the phenomena now seen as peculiarly <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobean</a> can be identified more closely with Anne's patronage than with James, who "fell asleep during some of England's most celebrated plays".

By late 1617, Anne's bouts of illness had become debilitating; the letter writer <a href="John%20Chamberlain%20%28letter%20writer%29">John Chamberlain</a> recorded: "The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body." In January 1619, royal physician Sir <a href="Theodore%20de%20Mayerne">Theodore de Mayerne</a> instructed Anne to saw wood to improve her blood flow, but the exertion served to make her worse. James visited Anne only three times during her last illness, though their son <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles</a> often slept in the adjoining bedroom at <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a> and was at her bedside during her last hours, when she had lost her sight. With her until the end was her personal maid, Anna Roos, who had arrived with her from Denmark in 1590. Queen Anne died aged 44 on 2 March 1619, of a dangerous form of <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a>.

Despite his neglect of Anne, James was emotionally affected by her death. He did not visit her during her dying days or attend her funeral, being himself sick, the symptoms, according to Sir Theodore de Mayerne, including "fainting, sighing, dread, incredible sadness ...". The inquest discovered Anne to be "much wasted within, specially her liver". After a prolonged delay, she was buried in <a href="Henry%20VII%20Lady%20Chapel">King Henry's Chapel</a>, <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, on 13 May 1619. The <a href="catafalque">catafalque</a>, designed by <a href="Maximilian%20Colt">Maximilian Colt</a>, placed over her grave was destroyed during the <a href="English%20civil%20war">civil war</a>.

As he had done before he ever met her, James turned to verse to pay his respects:

<poem>So did my Queen from hence her court remove
And left off earth to be enthroned above.
She's changed, not dead, for sure no good prince dies,
But, as the sun, sets, only for to rise.</poem>

Anne gave birth to seven children who survived beyond childbirth, four of whom died in infancy or early childhood; she also suffered at least three miscarriages. Her second son succeeded James as <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a>. Her daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a> was the "Winter Queen" of Bohemia and the grandmother of <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George I of Great Britain</a>.

Anne was portrayed in "". <a href="Finola%20Hughes">Finola Hughes</a> was the voice actress for her.

Anne was portrayed in the BBC tv mini-series "<a href="Gunpowder%2C%20Treason%20%26amp%3B%20Plot">Gunpowder, Treason & Plot</a>" in 2004. She was portrayed by danish actress Sira Stampe.

Casablanca (film)

Casablanca is a 1942 American <a href="Romance%20film">romantic drama</a> film directed by <a href="Michael%20Curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a> based on <a href="Murray%20Burnett">Murray Burnett</a> and <a href="Joan%20Alison">Joan Alison</a>'s unproduced stage play "<a href="Everybody%20Comes%20to%20Rick%27s">Everybody Comes to Rick's</a>". The film stars <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Henreid">Paul Henreid</a>; it also features <a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a>, <a href="Conrad%20Veidt">Conrad Veidt</a>, <a href="Sydney%20Greenstreet">Sydney Greenstreet</a>, <a href="Peter%20Lorre">Peter Lorre</a>, and <a href="Dooley%20Wilson">Dooley Wilson</a>. Set during contemporary <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it focuses on an American expatriate who must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her husband, a <a href="Czech%20resistance%20to%20Nazi%20occupation">Czech Resistance</a> leader, escape from the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy</a>-controlled city of <a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a> to continue his fight against the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a>.

<a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> story editor <a href="Irene%20Diamond">Irene Diamond</a> convinced producer <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> to purchase the <a href="film%20rights">film rights</a> to the play in January 1942. Brothers <a href="Julius%20J.%20Epstein">Julius</a> and <a href="Philip%20G.%20Epstein">Philip G. Epstein</a> were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s "<a href="Why%20We%20Fight">Why We Fight</a>" series early in 1942. <a href="Howard%20Koch%20%28screenwriter%29">Howard Koch</a> was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros. Studios</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, <a href="California">California</a> with the exception of one sequence at <a href="Van%20Nuys%20Airport">Van Nuys Airport</a> in <a href="Van%20Nuys%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Van Nuys, Los Angeles</a>.

Although "Casablanca" was an <a href="A-list">A-list</a> film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to be anything other than one of the hundreds of ordinary pictures produced by <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> that year. "Casablanca" was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the <a href="Operation%20Torch">Allied invasion of North Africa</a> a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.

Exceeding expectations, "Casablanca" went on to win the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, while Curtiz was selected as <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for writing the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>. Its reputation gradually improved, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and <a href="As%20Time%20Goes%20By%20%28song%29">pervasive theme song</a> have all become famous and it consistently ranks near the top of <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">lists of the greatest films in history</a>.

In December 1941, American <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in <a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>. "Rick's Café Américain" attracts a varied clientele, including <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> and German officials, <a href="Refugee%23World%20War%20II%20and%20UNHCR">refugees</a> desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he <a href="Gunrunning">ran guns</a> to <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> during <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">its war with Italy</a> and fought on the <a href="Republican%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Loyalist</a> side in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of "letters of transit" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around <a href="German-occupied%20Europe">German-occupied Europe</a> and to neutral <a href="Portugal%20in%20World%20War%20II">Portugal</a>, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy <a href="Prefecture%20of%20Police">prefect of police</a>. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.

Then the reason for Rick's bitterness—former lover Ilsa Lund—enters his establishment. Spotting Rick's friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play "<a href="As%20Time%20Goes%20By%20%28song%29">As Time Goes By</a>." Rick storms over, furious that Sam disobeyed his order never to perform that song, and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned fugitive <a href="Czech%20resistance%20to%20Nazi%20occupation">Czech Resistance</a> leader. They need the letters to escape to America to continue his work. German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to see that Laszlo fails.

When Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Privately, Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing ""<a href="Die%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Die Wacht am Rhein</a>"" ("The Watch on the Rhine"). Laszlo orders the house band to play ""<a href="La%20Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a>"". When the band looks to Rick, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Strasser demands Renault close the club, which he does on the pretext of suddenly discovering there is gambling on the premises.

Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted café. When he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>. While preparing to flee with Rick from the imminent <a href="Battle%20of%20France">fall of the city</a> to the German army, she learned Laszlo was alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick's bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting her believe she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.

When the police arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America.

When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed—"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life." Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. When policemen arrive, Renault pauses, then orders them to "round up the usual suspects." He suggests to Rick that they join the <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> in <a href="Brazzaville">Brazzaville</a>. As they walk away into the fog, Rick says, "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship".

The play's cast consisted of 16 speaking parts and several extras; the film script enlarged it to 22 speaking parts and hundreds of extras. The cast is notably international: only three of the credited actors were born in the United States (Bogart, Dooley Wilson, and Joy Page). The top-billed actors are:

The second-billed actors are:

Also credited are:

Notable uncredited actors are:

Much of the emotional impact of the film has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and refugees who were extras or played minor roles (in addition to leading actors Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre): such as <a href="Louis%20V.%20Arco">Louis V. Arco</a>, <a href="Trude%20Berliner">Trude Berliner</a>, <a href="Ilka%20Gr%C3%BCnig">Ilka Grünig</a>, , <a href="Richard%20Ryen">Richard Ryen</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20St%C3%B6ssel">Ludwig Stössel</a>, <a href="Hans%20Heinrich%20von%20Twardowski">Hans Heinrich von Twardowski</a>, and <a href="Wolfgang%20Zilzer">Wolfgang Zilzer</a>. A witness to the filming of the "duel of the anthems" sequence said he saw many of the actors crying and "realized that they were all real refugees". Harmetz argues that they "brought to a dozen small roles in "Casablanca" an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting". They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films, even though many were <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>.

The comedian <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a> may have had an unbilled cameo role, as was claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement and in the "Casablanca" press book. When asked in his column "Movie Answer Man", critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> first replied, "It looks something like him. That's all I can say". In a later column, he responded to a follow-up commenter, "I think you're right. The Jack Benny Fan Club can feel vindicated".

The film was based on <a href="Murray%20Burnett">Murray Burnett</a> and <a href="Joan%20Alison">Joan Alison</a>'s unproduced play "<a href="Everybody%20Comes%20to%20Rick%27s">Everybody Comes to Rick's</a>". The <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> story analyst who read the play, Stephen Karnot, called it (approvingly) "sophisticated hokum" and story editor <a href="Irene%20Diamond">Irene Diamond</a>, who had discovered the script on a trip to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> in 1941, convinced producer <a href="Hal%20Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> to buy the rights in January 1942 for $20,000, the most anyone in Hollywood had ever paid for an unproduced play. The project was renamed "Casablanca", apparently in imitation of the 1938 hit "<a href="Algiers%20%28film%29">Algiers</a>". Although an initial filming date was selected for April 10, 1942, delays led to a start of production on May 25. Filming was completed on August 3, and the production cost $1,039,000 ($75,000 over budget), above average for the time. Unusually, the film was shot in sequence, mainly because only the first half of the script was ready when filming began.

The entire picture was shot in the studio, except for the sequence showing Major Strasser's arrival, which was filmed at <a href="Van%20Nuys%20Airport">Van Nuys Airport</a>, and a few short clips of stock footage views of Paris. The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, "<a href="The%20Desert%20Song%20%281943%20film%29">The Desert Song</a>", and <a href="Set%20dresser">redressed</a> for the Paris <a href="flashback%20%28literary%20technique%29">flashbacks</a>.

The background of the final scene, which shows a <a href="Lockheed%20Model%2012%20Electra%20Junior">Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior</a> airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using <a href="Dwarfism">little person</a> <a href="extra%20%28actor%29">extras</a> and a proportionate cardboard plane. Fog was used to mask the model's unconvincing appearance. Nevertheless, the <a href="Disney%27s%20Hollywood%20Studios">Disney's Hollywood Studios</a> theme park in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a> purchased a Lockheed 12A for its <a href="Great%20Movie%20Ride">Great Movie Ride</a> attraction, and initially claimed that it was the actual plane used in the film.

Film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called <a href="Hal%20Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> the "key creative force" for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real parrot in the Blue Parrot bar).

The difference between Bergman's and Bogart's height caused some problems. She was two inches (5 cm) taller than Bogart, and claimed Curtiz had Bogart stand on blocks or sit on cushions in their scenes together.

Later, there were plans for a further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies' <a href="Operation%20Torch">1942 invasion of North Africa</a>. It proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> judged "it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending."

The original play was inspired by a trip to Europe made by Murray Burnett and his wife in 1938, during which they visited <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> shortly after the <a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a> and were affected by the <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> they saw. In the south of France, they went to a nightclub that had a multinational clientele, among them many exiles and refugees, and the prototype of Sam. In "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Paul Fairclough writes that <a href="Cinema%20Vox">Cinema Vox</a> in <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a> "was Africa's biggest when it opened in 1935, with 2,000 seats and a retractable roof. As Tangier was in Spanish territory, the theatre's wartime bar heaved with spies, refugees and underworld hoods, securing its place in cinematic history as the inspiration for Rick's Cafe in "Casablanca"." The scene of the singing of "La Marseillaise" in the bar is attributed by the film scholar Julian Jackson as an adaptation of a similar scene from <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a>'s film from 5 years before titled "<a href="La%20Grande%20Illusion">La Grande Illusion</a>".

The first writers assigned to the script were twins <a href="Julius%20J.%20Epstein">Julius</a> and <a href="Philip%20G.%20Epstein">Philip Epstein</a> who, against the wishes of <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>, left at <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s request early in 1942 to work on the "<a href="Why%20We%20Fight">Why We Fight</a>" series in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> While they were gone, the other credited writer, <a href="Howard%20Koch%20%28screenwriter%29">Howard Koch</a>, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were reassigned to "Casablanca" and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, "When we began, we didn't have a finished script ... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know ... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.

In the play, the Ilsa character is an American named Lois Meredith; she does not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris has ended. Rick is a lawyer. To make Rick's motivation more believable, Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.

The uncredited <a href="Casey%20Robinson">Casey Robinson</a> assisted with three weeks of rewrites, including contributing the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe. Koch highlighted the political and <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>tic elements, and Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks. In a telegram to film editor Owen Marks on August 7, 1942, Wallis suggested two possible final lines of dialogue for Rick: "Louis, I might have known you'd mix your patriotism with a little larceny" or "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." Two weeks later, Wallis settled on the 'beautiful friendship' line, for which Bogart was recalled to dub a month after shooting had finished.

Despite the many writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a "wonderfully unified and consistent" script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz's which accounted for this: "Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance." Julius Epstein would later note the screenplay contained "more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better."

The film ran into some trouble with <a href="Joseph%20Breen">Joseph Breen</a> of the <a href="Production%20Code%20Administration">Production Code Administration</a> (the Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together. Extensive changes were made, with several lines of dialogue removed or altered. All direct references to sex were deleted; Renault's selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa's previous sexual relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly. Also, in the original script, when Sam plays "As Time Goes By", Rick remarks, "What the —— are you playing?" This line was altered to: "Sam, I told you never to play..." to conform to Breen's objection to an implied swear word.

Wallis's first choice for director was <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>, but he was unavailable, so Wallis turned to his close friend <a href="Michael%20Curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a>. Curtiz was a Hungarian Jewish émigré; he had come to the U.S. in 1926, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.

<a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> has commented that in "Casablanca" "very few shots ... are memorable as shots," as Curtiz wanted images to express the story rather than to stand alone. He contributed relatively little to development of the plot. Casey Robinson said Curtiz "knew nothing whatever about story ... he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories."

Critic <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> called the film "the most decisive exception to the <a href="auteur%20theory">auteur theory</a>", of which Sarris was the most prominent proponent in the United States. <a href="Aljean%20Harmetz">Aljean Harmetz</a> has responded, "nearly every Warner Bros. picture was an exception to the auteur theory". Other critics give more credit to Curtiz. Sidney Rosenzweig, in his study of the director's work, sees the film as a typical example of Curtiz's highlighting of moral dilemmas.

The <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> <a href="Film%20editing">montages</a>, such as the opening sequence of the refugee trail and the invasion of France, were directed by <a href="Don%20Siegel">Don Siegel</a>.

The <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> was <a href="Arthur%20Edeson">Arthur Edeson</a>, a veteran who had previously shot "<a href="The%20Maltese%20Falcon%20%281941%20film%29">The Maltese Falcon</a>" and "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281931%20film%29">Frankenstein</a>". Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman. She was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with <a href="catch%20light">catch light</a>s to make her eyes sparkle; the whole effect was designed to make her face seem "ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic". Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>, the symbol of the <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French Forces</a> and emotional turmoil. Dark <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> and <a href="expressionist">expressionist</a> lighting was used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture. Rosenzweig argues these shadow and lighting effects are classic elements of the Curtiz style, along with the fluid camera work and the use of the environment as a framing device.

The music was written by <a href="Max%20Steiner">Max Steiner</a>, who was best known for the <a href="film%20score">score</a> for <a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">"Gone with the Wind"</a>. The song "<a href="As%20Time%20Goes%20By%20%28song%29">As Time Goes By</a>" by <a href="Herman%20Hupfeld">Herman Hupfeld</a> had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to write his own composition to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role (María in "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls%20%28film%29">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>") and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it and "<a href="La%20Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a>", the French <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a>, transforming them as <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s to reflect changing moods. Even though Steiner didn't like "As Time Goes By", he admitted in a 1943 interview that it "must have had something to attract so much attention." The "piano player" Dooley Wilson was a drummer, not a trained pianist, so the piano music for the film was played offscreen by Jean Plummer and dubbed.

Particularly memorable is the "duel of the songs" between Strasser and Laszlo at Rick's cafe. In the soundtrack, "La Marseillaise" is played by a full orchestra. Originally, the opposing piece for this iconic sequence was to be the "<a href="Horst%20Wessel%20Lied">Horst Wessel Lied</a>", a <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> anthem, but this was still under international copyright in non-Allied countries. Instead "<a href="Die%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Die Wacht am Rhein</a>" was used. The "<a href="Deutschlandlied">Deutschlandlied</a>", the national anthem of Germany, is used several times in minor mode as a leitmotif for the German threat, i.e. in the scene in Paris as it is announced that the German army will reach Paris the next day. It features in the final scene, in which it gives way to "La Marseillaise" after Strasser is shot.

Other songs include:

The piano featured in the Paris flashback sequences was sold in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on December 14, 2012, at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> for more than $600,000 to an anonymous bidder. The piano Sam "plays" in Rick's Café Américain, put up for auction with other <a href="film%20memorabilia">film memorabilia</a> by <a href="Turner%20Classic%20Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> at <a href="Bonhams">Bonhams</a> in New York in November 2014, sold for $3.4 million.

Although an initial release date was anticipated for early 1943, the film premiered at the Hollywood Theater in New York City on November 26, 1942, to coincide with the Allied invasion of North Africa and <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Casablanca">the capture of Casablanca</a>. It went into general release on January 23, 1943, to take advantage of the <a href="Casablanca%20Conference">Casablanca Conference</a>, a high-level meeting in the city between British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and American President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">Office of War Information</a> prevented screening of the film to troops in North Africa, believing it would cause resentment among Vichy supporters in the region.

"Casablanca" received "consistently good reviews". <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote, "The Warners ... have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap." He applauded the combination of "sentiment, humor and pathos with taut melodrama and bristling intrigue". Crowther noted its "devious convolutions of the plot", and praised the screenplay quality as "of the best" and the cast's performances as "all of the first order".

The trade paper "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" commended the film's "combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction" and the "variety of moods, action, suspense, comedy and drama that makes "Casablanca" an A-1 entry at the <a href="Box%20office">b.o.</a>" "Film is splendid anti-Axis propaganda, particularly inasmuch as the propaganda is strictly a by-product of the principal action and contributes to it instead of getting in the way." The review also applauded the performances of Bergman and Henreid and noted that "Bogart, as might be expected, is more at ease as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse."

Some other reviews were less enthusiastic. "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" rated it only "pretty tolerable" and said it was "not quite up to "<a href="Across%20the%20Pacific">Across the Pacific</a>", Bogart's last spyfest".

In the 1,500-seat Hollywood Theater, the film grossed $255,000 over ten weeks. In its initial U.S. release, it was a substantial but not spectacular box-office success, taking in $3.7 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 1943.

According to Warner Bros records the film earned $3,398,000 domestically and $3,461,000 foreign.

In the seven decades since its production the film has grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow". By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most successful of Warners' wartime movies (behind "<a href="Shine%20On%2C%20Harvest%20Moon%20%28film%29">Shine On, Harvest Moon</a>" and "<a href="This%20Is%20the%20Army">This Is the Army</a>"). On April 21, 1957, the <a href="Brattle%20Theater">Brattle Theater</a> of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film as part of a season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening "Casablanca" during the week of final exams at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. <a href="Todd%20Gitlin">Todd Gitlin</a>, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was "the acting out of my own personal rite of passage". The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other films famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, "Casablanca" was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.

On the film's 50th anniversary, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called "Casablanca"s great strength "the purity of its Golden Age Hollywoodness [and] the enduring craftsmanship of its resonantly hokey dialogue". Bob Strauss wrote in the newspaper that the film achieved a "near-perfect entertainment balance" of comedy, romance, and suspense.

According to <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, "Casablanca" is "probably on more lists of the greatest films of all time than any other single title, including "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>"" because of its wider appeal. Ebert opined that "Citizen Kane" is generally considered to be a "greater" film, but "Casablanca" "is more loved." In his opinion, the film is popular because "the people in it are all so good", and it is "a wonderful gem". Ebert said that he has never heard of a negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticized, citing unrealistic <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s and the stiff character/portrayal of Laszlo. Critic <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> considers "Casablanca" to be "the best Hollywood movie of all time."

Rick, according to <a href="Rudy%20Behlmer">Rudy Behlmer</a>, is "not a hero ... not a bad guy": he does what is necessary to get along with the authorities and "sticks his neck out for nobody". The other characters, in Behlmer's words, are "not cut and dried" and come into their goodness over the course of the film. Renault begins as a collaborator with the Nazis who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is "caught in the emotional struggle" over which man she really loves. By the end, however, "everybody is sacrificing." Behlmer also emphasized the variety in the picture: "it's a blend of drama, melodrama, comedy [and] intrigue".

A few reviewers have had reservations. To <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a>, "It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism ..." Poet and critic <a href="Dan%20Schneider%20%28writer%29">Dan Schneider</a> wrote that the work "does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana", but criticized it as a melodrama "driven by plot, not by character development. All the characters react to what the plot dictates to them; the plot does not organically flow from their personae." <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> wrote that "by any strict critical standards ... "Casablanca" is a very mediocre film." He viewed the changes the characters undergo as inconsistent rather than complex: "It is a comic strip, a hotchpotch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects." However, he added that due to the presence of multiple archetypes which allow "the power of Narrative in its natural state without Art intervening to discipline it", it is a movie reaching "Homeric depths" as a "phenomenon worthy of awe." "Casablanca" holds a 97% "Certified Fresh" rating and a <a href="Weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">weighted average</a> of 9.46/10 on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 79 reviews, with the consensus: "An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood's quintessential statement on love and romance, "Casablanca" has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman."

In the November/December 1982 issue of "<a href="Film%20Comment">Film Comment</a>", Chuck Ross claimed that he retyped the screenplay to "Casablanca", changing the title back to "<a href="Everybody%20Comes%20to%20Rick%27s">Everybody Comes to Rick's</a>" and the name of the piano player to <a href="Dooley%20Wilson">Dooley Wilson</a>, and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as "Casablanca"), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested turning it into a novel.

Many subsequent films have drawn on elements of "Casablanca". "<a href="Passage%20to%20Marseille">Passage to Marseille</a>" (1944) reunited actors Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre and director Curtiz in 1944, and there are similarities between "Casablanca" and another later Bogart film, "<a href="To%20Have%20and%20Have%20Not%20%28film%29">To Have and Have Not</a>" (also 1944).

Parodies have included the <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>' "<a href="A%20Night%20in%20Casablanca">A Night in Casablanca</a>" (1946), <a href="Neil%20Simon">Neil Simon</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cheap%20Detective">The Cheap Detective</a>" (1978), and "<a href="Out%20Cold%20%282001%20film%29">Out Cold</a>" (2001). Indirectly, it provided the title for the 1995 neo-noir film "<a href="The%20Usual%20Suspects">The Usual Suspects</a>". <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s "<a href="Play%20It%20Again%2C%20Sam%20%281972%20film%29">Play It Again, Sam</a>" (1972) appropriated Bogart's "Casablanca" persona as the fantasy mentor for Allen's character.

The film "Casablanca" was a plot device in the science-fiction television movie "<a href="Overdrawn%20at%20the%20Memory%20Bank">Overdrawn at the Memory Bank</a>" (1983), based on <a href="John%20Varley%20%28author%29">John Varley</a>'s story. It was referred to in <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n "<a href="Brazil%20%281985%20film%29">Brazil</a>" (1985). <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> produced its own parody in the homage "<a href="Carrotblanca">Carrotblanca</a>", a 1995 <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a>. Film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> pointed out the plot of the film "<a href="Barb%20Wire%20%28film%29">Barb Wire</a>" (1996) was identical to that of "Casablanca". In "<a href="Casablanca%20%28novella%29">Casablanca</a>", a novella by Argentine writer <a href="Edgar%20Brau">Edgar Brau</a>, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film "<a href="La%20La%20Land%20%28film%29">La La Land</a>" contains multiple allusions to "Casablanca" in the imagery, dialogue, and plot. Director <a href="Robert%20Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> of "<a href="Allied%20%28film%29">Allied</a>" (2016), which is also set in 1942 Casablanca, studied the film to capture the city's elegance.

Because of its November 1942 release, the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics">New York Film Critics</a> decided to include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. "Casablanca" lost to "<a href="In%20Which%20We%20Serve">In Which We Serve</a>". However, the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> stated that since the film went into national release in the beginning of 1943, it would be included in that year's nominations. "Casablanca" was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three.

As Bogart stepped out of his car at the awards ceremony, "the crowd surged forward, almost engulfing him and his wife, <a href="Mayo%20Methot">Mayo Methot</a>. It took 12 police officers to rescue the two, and a red-faced, startled, yet smiling Bogart heard a chorus of cries of 'good luck' and 'here's looking at you, kid' as he was rushed into the theater."

When the award for Best Picture was announced, producer <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> got up to accept, but studio head <a href="Jack%20L.%20Warner">Jack L. Warner</a> rushed up to the stage "with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction," Wallis later recalled. "I couldn't believe it was happening. "Casablanca" had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious ... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." This incident would lead Wallis to leave Warner Bros. in April.

In 1989, the film was one of the first 25 films selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". In 2005, it was named one of the 100 greatest films of the last 80 years by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine (the selected films were not ranked). "<a href="Bright%20Lights%20Film%20Journal">Bright Lights Film Journal</a>" stated in 2007, "It is one of those rare films from Hollywood’s Golden Age which has managed to transcend its era to entertain generations of moviegoers...". The film also ranked at number 28 on "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>"s list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, which stated: "Love, honour, thrills, wisecracks and a hit tune are among the attractions, which also include a perfect supporting cast of villains, sneaks, thieves, refugees and bar staff. But it's Bogart and Bergman's show, entering immortality as screen lovers reunited only to part. The irrefutible ["sic"] proof that great movies are accidents." Screenwriting teacher <a href="Robert%20McKee">Robert McKee</a> maintains that the script is "the greatest screenplay of all time". In 2006, the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%2C%20West">Writers Guild of America, West</a> agreed, voting it the best ever in its list of the 101 greatest screenplays.

The film has been selected by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> for many of their lists of important American films:

"Casablanca" has been subjected to many readings; <a href="Semiotics">Semioticians</a> account for the film's popularity by claiming that its inclusion of <a href="stereotype">stereotype</a>s paradoxically strengthens the film. Umberto Eco wrote:

Eco also singled out sacrifice as a theme, "the myth of sacrifice runs through the whole film". It was this theme which resonated with a wartime audience that was reassured by the idea that painful sacrifice and going off to war could be romantic gestures done for the greater good.

Koch also considered the film a political <a href="allegory">allegory</a>. Rick is compared to President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who gambled "on the odds of going to war until circumstance and his own submerged nobility force him to close his casino (partisan politics) and commit himself—first by financing the Side of Right and then by fighting for it". The connection is reinforced by the film's title, which means "<a href="White%20House">white house</a>".

Harvey Greenberg presents a <a href="Freudian">Freudian</a> reading in his "The Movies on Your Mind", in which the transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an <a href="Oedipus%20complex">Oedipus complex</a>, which is resolved only when Rick begins to identify with the father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the most important aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.

"Casablanca" was initially released on <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a> and <a href="VHS">VHS</a> by <a href="Magnetic%20Video">Magnetic Video</a> and later by <a href="CBS/Fox%20Video">CBS/Fox Video</a> (as <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> owned the rights at the time). It was next released on <a href="laserdisc">laserdisc</a> in 1991, and on VHS in 1992—both from <a href="MGM%20Home%20Entertainment">MGM/UA Home Entertainment</a> (distributing for <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner Entertainment Co.</a>), which at the time was distributed by <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a>. It was first released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in 1997 by MGM, containing the trailer and a making-of featurette (Warner Home Video reissued the DVD in 2000). A subsequent two-disc special edition, containing audio commentaries, documentaries, and a newly remastered visual and audio presentation, was released in 2003.

An <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> was released on November 14, 2006, containing the same special features as the 2003 DVD. Reviewers were impressed with the new high-definition transfer of the film.

A <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> release with new special features came out on December 2, 2008; it is also available on DVD. The Blu-ray was initially only released as an expensive gift set with a booklet, a luggage tag and other assorted gift-type items. It was eventually released as a stand-alone Blu-ray in September 2009. On March 27, 2012, Warner released a new 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo set. It includes a brand-new 4K restoration and new bonus material.

Almost from the moment "Casablanca" became a hit, talk began of producing a sequel. One titled "Brazzaville" (in the final scene, Renault recommends fleeing to <a href="Brazzaville">that Free French-held city</a>) was planned, but never produced. (A newspaper article at the time mentions that Bogart and Greenstreet "will continue their characterizations from the first film, and it's likely that Geraldine Fitzgerald will have an important role".). Since then, no studio has seriously considered filming a sequel or outright remake. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> refused an invitation to remake the film in 1974, citing its <a href="cult%20status">cult status</a> among American students as his reason. Attempts to recapture the magic of "Casablanca" in other settings, such as "<a href="Caboblanco">Caboblanco</a>" (1980), "a South American-set retooling of "Casablanca"", and "<a href="Havana%20%28film%29">Havana</a>" (1990) have been poorly received.

Stories of a "Casablanca" remake or sequel nonetheless persist. In 2008, the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" reported that <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> was pursuing a remake set in modern-day <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. In 2012, both "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reported on efforts by Cass Warner, granddaughter of <a href="Harry%20Warner">Harry Warner</a> and friend of the late Howard Koch, to produce a sequel featuring the search by Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund's illegitimate son for the whereabouts of his biological father.

The novel "<a href="As%20Time%20Goes%20By%20%28novel%29">As Time Goes By</a>", written by <a href="Michael%20Walsh%20%28author%29">Michael Walsh</a> and published in 1998, was authorized by Warner. The novel picks up where the film leaves off, and also tells of Rick's mysterious past in America. The book met with little success. <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> provided an unofficial sequel in his 1985 novel "Suspects".

There have been two short-lived television series based upon "Casablanca", both sharing the title. <a href="Casablanca%20%281955%20TV%20series%29">The first</a>, which aired on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> as part of the <a href="wheel%20series">wheel series</a> "<a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Presents">Warner Bros. Presents</a>" in hour-long episodes from 1955 to 1956, is a Cold War espionage program set contemporaneously with its production, and starred <a href="Charles%20McGraw">Charles McGraw</a> as Rick and <a href="Marcel%20Dalio">Marcel Dalio</a>, who played Emil the <a href="croupier">croupier</a> in the movie, as the police chief. The <a href="Casablanca%20%281983%20TV%20series%29">second series</a>, briefly broadcast on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> in April 1983, starred <a href="David%20Soul">David Soul</a> as Rick and was canceled after 3 weeks.

There were several radio adaptations of the film. The two best-known were a thirty-minute adaptation on "<a href="The%20Screen%20Guild%20Theater">The Screen Guild Theater</a>" on April 26, 1943, starring Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid, and an hour-long version on the "<a href="Lux%20Radio%20Theater">Lux Radio Theater</a>" on January 24, 1944, featuring <a href="Alan%20Ladd">Alan Ladd</a> as Rick, <a href="Hedy%20Lamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a> as Ilsa, and <a href="John%20Loder%20%28actor%29">John Loder</a> as Victor Laszlo. Two other thirty-minute adaptations were aired, one on "<a href="Philip%20Morris%20Playhouse">Philip Morris Playhouse</a>" on September 3, 1943, and the other on "Theater of Romance" on December 19, 1944, in which Dooley Wilson reprised his role as Sam.

<a href="Julius%20J.%20Epstein">Julius Epstein</a> made two attempts to turn the film into a <a href="Broadway%20musical">Broadway musical</a>, in 1951 and 1967, but neither made it to the stage. The original play, "<a href="Everybody%20Comes%20to%20Rick%27s">Everybody Comes to Rick's</a>", was produced in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, in August 1946, and again in London in April 1991, but met with no success. The film was adapted into a musical by the <a href="Takarazuka%20Revue">Takarazuka Revue</a>, an all-female Japanese musical theater company, and ran from November 2009 through February 2010.

"Casablanca" was part of the <a href="film%20colorization">film colorization</a> controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">television network WTBS</a>. In 1984, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM/UA</a> hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a> of <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a> purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, "["Casablanca"] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment."

The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the "Los Angeles Times" called the finished product "state of the art", it was mostly met with negative critical reception. It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Popular%20Film%20%26amp%3B%20Television">Journal of Popular Film & Television</a>" criticized the colorization, "... "Casablanca" in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor." Bogart's son Stephen said, "if you're going to colorize "Casablanca", why not put arms on the <a href="Venus%20de%20Milo">Venus de Milo</a>?"

Several rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was originally chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the <a href="movie%20studio">studio</a> early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. <a href="George%20Raft">George Raft</a> claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.

Another well-known story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Laszlo to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people." It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the <a href="United%20States%20Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code%20of%201930">production code</a> forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered. The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, <a href="Julius%20J.%20Epstein">Julius</a> and <a href="Philip%20G.%20Epstein">Philip</a>, were driving down <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a> and stopped for the light at <a href="Beverly%20Glen%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Beverly Glen</a>. At that instant the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, "Round up the usual suspects!" By the time they had driven past <a href="Fairfax%20District%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Fairfax</a> and the <a href="Cahuenga%20Pass">Cahuenga Pass</a> and through the <a href="Old%20Warner%20Brothers%20Studio">Warner Brothers studio's</a> portals at <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, in the words of Julius Epstein, "the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart" had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved. The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. Rewrites did occur during the filming, but Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s words, "emotional", not "factual".

The film has several logical flaws, one being the two "letters of transit" that enable their bearers to leave <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> territory. According to the , Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either Vichy general <a href="Maxime%20Weygand">Weygand</a> or <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> general <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">de Gaulle</a>. The French subtitles on the official DVD read Weygand; the English ones specify de Gaulle. Weygand had been the Vichy delegate-general for the <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">North African colonies</a> until November 1941, a month before the film is set. But de Gaulle was the head of the Free French <a href="government%20in%20exile">government in exile</a>, so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit. A classic <a href="MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, the letters were invented by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.

In the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, "This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault," Ebert points out, "It makes no sense that he could walk around freely. ... He would be arrested on sight."

In addition, no uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.

According to Harmetz, the usual route out of Germany, at least for people in the film industry, was not via Morocco and Lisbon but via Vienna, Prague, Paris and England. Only the film's technical adviser, Robert Aisner, traced the path to Morocco shown in the film's opening scene.

The script has been subject to a significant amount of misquotation. One of the lines most closely associated with the film—"Play it again, Sam"—is inaccurate. When Ilsa first enters the Café Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to "Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake." After he feigns ignorance, she responds, "Play it, Sam. Play '<a href="As%20Time%20Goes%20By%20%28song%29">As Time Goes By</a>'." Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, "You played it for her, you can play it for me," and "If she can stand it, I can! Play it!" Rick's toast to Ilsa, "Here's looking at you, kid", used four times, was not written into the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to a comment Bogart said to Bergman as he taught her poker between takes.

Stephen Crane

Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 – June 5, 1900) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the <a href="literary%20realism">Realist</a> tradition as well as early examples of American <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">Naturalism</a> and <a href="Impressionism%20%28literature%29">Impressionism</a>. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation.

The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Having little interest in university studies though he was active in a fraternity, he left Syracuse University in 1891 to work as a reporter and writer. Crane's <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a> was the 1893 <a href="Bowery">Bowery</a> tale "", generally considered by critics to be the first work of American literary Naturalism. He won international acclaim in 1895 for his <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> novel "<a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a>", which he wrote without having any battle experience.

In 1896, Crane endured a highly publicized scandal after appearing as a witness in the trial of a suspected prostitute, an acquaintance named Dora Clark. Late that year he accepted an offer to travel to Cuba as a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a>. As he waited in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a> for passage, he met <a href="Cora%20Crane">Cora Taylor</a>, with whom he began a lasting relationship. En route to Cuba, Crane's vessel the <a href="SS%20Commodore">SS "Commodore"</a> sank off the coast of Florida, leaving him and others adrift for 30 hours in a <a href="dinghy">dinghy</a>. Crane described the ordeal in "<a href="The%20Open%20Boat">The Open Boat</a>". During the final years of his life, he covered conflicts in Greece (accompanied by Cora, recognized as the first woman war correspondent) and later lived in England with her. He was befriended by writers such as <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> and <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>. Plagued by financial difficulties and ill health, Crane died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in a <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> sanatorium in Germany at the age of 28.

At the time of his death, Crane was considered an important figure in American literature. After he was nearly forgotten for two decades, critics revived interest in his life and work. Crane's writing is characterized by vivid intensity, distinctive <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, and <a href="irony">irony</a>. Common themes involve fear, spiritual crises and social isolation. Although recognized primarily for "The Red Badge of Courage", which has become an American classic, Crane is also known for his poetry, journalism, and short stories such as "The Open Boat", "<a href="The%20Blue%20Hotel">The Blue Hotel</a>", "<a href="The%20Bride%20Comes%20to%20Yellow%20Sky">The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky</a>", and "<a href="The%20Monster%20%28novella%29">The Monster</a>". His writing made a deep impression on 20th-century writers, most prominent among them <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, and is thought to have inspired the <a href="Modernists">Modernists</a> and the <a href="Imagism">Imagists</a>.

Stephen Crane was born on November 1, 1871, in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, to <a href="Jonathan%20Townley%20Crane">Jonathan Townley Crane</a>, a minister in the Methodist Episcopal church, and <a href="Mary%20Helen%20Peck%20Crane">Mary Helen Peck Crane</a>, daughter of a clergyman, <a href="George%20Peck%20%28clergyman%29">George Peck</a>. He was the fourteenth and last child born to the couple. At 45, Helen Crane had suffered the early deaths of her previous four children, each of whom died within one year of birth. Nicknamed "Stevie" by the family, he joined eight surviving brothers and sisters—Mary Helen, George Peck, Jonathan Townley, <a href="William%20Howe%20Crane">William Howe</a>, Agnes Elizabeth, Edmund Byran, Wilbur Fiske, and Luther.

The Cranes were descended from Jaspar Crane, a founder of <a href="New%20Haven%20Colony">New Haven Colony</a>, who had migrated there from England in 1639. Stephen was named for a putative founder of <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabethtown, New Jersey</a>, who had, according to family tradition, come from England or Wales in 1665, as well as his great-great-grandfather <a href="Stephen%20Crane%20%28delegate%29">Stephen Crane</a> (1709–1780), a <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> patriot who served as New Jersey delegate to the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First Continental Congress</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Crane later wrote that his father, Dr. Crane, "was a great, fine, simple mind," who had written numerous tracts on theology. Although his mother was a popular spokeswoman for the <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> and a highly religious woman, Crane wrote that he did not believe "she was as narrow as most of her friends or family." The young Stephen was raised primarily by his sister Agnes, who was 15 years his senior. The family moved to <a href="Port%20Jervis%2C%20New%20York">Port Jervis, New York</a>, in 1876, where Dr. Crane became the pastor of Drew Methodist Church, a position that he retained until his death.

As a child, Stephen was often sickly and afflicted by constant <a href="common%20cold">cold</a>s. When the boy was almost two, his father wrote in his diary that his youngest son became "so sick that we are anxious about him." Despite his fragile nature, Crane was an intelligent child who taught himself to read before the age of four. His first known inquiry, recorded by his father, dealt with writing; at the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley's writing, he asked his mother, "how do you spell "O"?" In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas. Entitled "I'd Rather Have –", it is his first surviving poem. Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880, but he had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks. Recalling this feat, he wrote that it "sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, but I do remember that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me."

Dr. Crane died on February 16, 1880, at the age of 60; Stephen was eight years old. Some 1,400 people mourned Dr. Crane at his funeral, more than double the size of his congregation. After her husband's death, Mrs. Crane moved to <a href="Roseville%2C%20Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Roseville</a>, near Newark, leaving Stephen in the care of his older brother Edmund, with whom the young boy lived with cousins in <a href="Sussex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Sussex County</a>. He next lived with his brother William, a lawyer, in Port Jervis for several years.

His older sister Helen took him to <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park</a> to be with their brother Townley and his wife, Fannie. Townley was a professional journalist; he headed the <a href="Long%20Branch%2C%20New%20Jersey">Long Branch</a> department of both the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>" and the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>, and also served as editor of the "Asbury Park Shore Press". Agnes, another Crane sister, joined the siblings in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. She took a position at Asbury Park's intermediate school and moved in with Helen to care for the young Stephen.

Within a couple of years, the Crane family suffered more losses. First, Townley and his wife lost their two young children. His wife Fannie died of <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a> in November 1883. Agnes Crane became ill and died on June 10, 1884, of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> at the age of 28.

Crane wrote his first known story, "Uncle Jake and the Bell Handle", when he was 14. In late 1885, he enrolled at <a href="The%20Pennington%20School">Pennington Seminary</a>, a ministry-focused coeducational boarding school north of <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a>. His father had been principal there from 1849 to 1858. Soon after her youngest son left for school, Mrs. Crane began suffering what the "Asbury Park Shore Press" reported as "a temporary aberration of the mind." She had apparently recovered by early 1886, but later that year, her son, 23-year-old Luther Crane, died after falling in front of an oncoming train while working as a flagman for the Erie Railroad. It was the fourth death in six years among Stephen's immediate family.
After two years, Crane left Pennington for <a href="Claverack%20College">Claverack College</a>, a quasi-military school. He later looked back on his time at Claverack as "the happiest period of my life although I was not aware of it." A classmate remembered him as a highly literate but erratic student, lucky to pass examinations in math and science, and yet "far in advance of his fellow students in his knowledge of History and Literature", his favorite subjects. While he held an impressive record on the drill field and baseball diamond, Crane generally did not excel in the classroom. Not having a middle name, as was customary among other students, he took to signing his name "Stephen T. Crane" in order "to win recognition as a regular fellow". Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious. He sometimes skipped class in order to play baseball, a game in which he starred as <a href="catcher">catcher</a>. He was also greatly interested in the school's military training program. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion. One classmate described him as "indeed physically attractive without being handsome", but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular at Claverack. Although academically weak, Crane gained experience at Claverack that provided background (and likely some anecdotes from the Civil War veterans on the staff) that proved useful when he came to write "The Red Badge of Courage".
In mid-1888, Crane became his brother Townley's assistant at a New Jersey shore news bureau, working there every summer until 1892. Crane's first publication under his byline was an article on the explorer <a href="Henry%20M.%20Stanley">Henry M. Stanley</a>'s famous quest to find the Scottish missionary <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a> in Africa. It appeared in the February 1890 Claverack College "Vidette". Within a few months, Crane was persuaded by his family to forgo a military career and transfer to <a href="Lafayette%20College">Lafayette College</a> in <a href="Easton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Easton, Pennsylvania</a>, in order to pursue a mining engineering degree. He registered at Lafayette on September 12, and promptly became involved in extracurricular activities; he took up baseball again and joined the largest fraternity, <a href="Delta%20Upsilon">Delta Upsilon</a>. He also joined both rival literary societies, named for (George) Washington and (Benjamin) Franklin. Crane infrequently attended classes and ended the semester with grades for four of the seven courses he had taken.

After one semester, Crane transferred to <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>, where he enrolled as a non-degree candidate in the College of Liberal Arts. He roomed in the Delta Upsilon fraternity house and joined the baseball team. Attending just one class (English Literature) during the middle trimester, he remained in residence while taking no courses in the third semester.

Concentrating on his writing, Crane began to experiment with tone and style while trying out different subjects. He published his fictional story, "Great Bugs of Onondaga," simultaneously in the "<a href="The%20Post-Standard">Syracuse Daily Standard</a>" and the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>". Declaring college "a waste of time", Crane decided to become a full-time writer and reporter. He attended a Delta Upsilon chapter meeting on June 12, 1891, but shortly afterward left college for good.

In the summer of 1891, Crane often camped with friends in the nearby area of <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20New%20York">Sullivan County, New York</a>, where his brother Edmund occupied a house obtained as part of their brother William's Hartwood Club (Association) land dealings. He used this area as the geographic setting for several short stories, which were posthumously published in a collection under the title "Stephen Crane: Sullivan County Tales and Sketches". Crane showed two of these works to "Tribune" editor <a href="Willis%20Fletcher%20Johnson">Willis Fletcher Johnson</a>, a friend of the family, who accepted them for the publication. "Hunting Wild Dogs" and "The Last of the Mohicans" were the first of fourteen unsigned Sullivan County sketches and tales that were published in the "Tribune" between February and July 1892. Crane also showed Johnson an early draft of his first novel, "".

Later that summer, Crane met and befriended author <a href="Hamlin%20Garland">Hamlin Garland</a>, who had been lecturing locally on American literature and the expressive arts; on August 17 he gave a talk on novelist <a href="William%20Dean%20Howells">William Dean Howells</a>, which Crane wrote up for the "Tribune". Garland became a mentor for and champion of the young writer, whose intellectual honesty impressed him. Their relationship suffered in later years, however, because Garland disapproved of Crane's alleged immorality, related to his living with a woman married to another man.

Stephen moved into his brother Edmund's house in <a href="Lakeview%2C%20Paterson">Lakeview</a>, a suburb of <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>, in the fall of 1891. From here he made frequent trips into <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, writing and reporting particularly on its impoverished tenement districts. Crane focused particularly on The <a href="Bowery">Bowery</a>, a small and once prosperous neighborhood in the southern part of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. After the Civil War, Bowery shops and mansions had given way to saloons, dance halls, brothels and <a href="flophouse">flophouse</a>s, all of which Crane frequented. He later said he did so for research. He was attracted to the human nature found in the slums, considering it "open and plain, with nothing hidden". Believing nothing honest and unsentimental had been written about the Bowery, Crane became determined to do so himself; this was the setting of his first novel. On December 7, 1891, Crane's mother died at the age of 64, and the 20-year-old appointed Edmund as his guardian.

Despite being frail, undernourished and suffering from a hacking cough, which did not prevent him from smoking cigarettes, in the spring of 1892 Crane began a romance with Lily Brandon Munroe, a married woman who was estranged from her husband. Although Munroe later said Crane "was not a handsome man", she admired his "remarkable almond-shaped gray eyes." He begged her to elope with him, but her family opposed the match because Crane lacked money and prospects, and she declined. Their last meeting likely occurred in April 1898, when he again asked her to run away with him and she again refused.
Between July 2 and September 11, 1892, Crane published at least ten news reports on Asbury Park affairs. Although a "Tribune" colleague stated that Crane "was not highly distinguished above any other boy of twenty who had gained a reputation for saying and writing bright things," that summer his reporting took on a more skeptical, hypocrisy-deflating tone. A storm of controversy erupted over a report he wrote on the <a href="Junior%20Order%20of%20United%20American%20Mechanics">Junior Order of United American Mechanics</a>' American Day Parade, entitled "Parades and Entertainments". Published on August 21, the report juxtaposes the "bronzed, slope-shouldered, uncouth" marching men "begrimed with dust" and the spectators dressed in "summer gowns, lace parasols, tennis trousers, straw hats and indifferent smiles". Believing they were being ridiculed, some JOUAM marchers were outraged and wrote to the editor. The owner of the "Tribune", <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a>, was that year's Republican vice-presidential candidate, and this likely increased the sensitivity of the paper's management to the issue. Although Townley wrote a piece for the "Asbury Park Daily Press" in his brother's defense, the "Tribune" quickly apologized to its readers, calling Stephen Crane's piece "a bit of random correspondence, passed inadvertently by the copy editor". Hamlin Garland and biographer John Barry attested that Crane told them he had been dismissed by the "Tribune", although Willis Fletcher Johnson later denied this. The paper did not publish any of Crane's work after 1892.

Crane struggled to make a living as a free-lance writer, contributing sketches and feature articles to various New York newspapers. In October 1892, he moved into a rooming house in Manhattan whose boarders were a group of medical students. During this time, he expanded or entirely reworked "Maggie: A Girl of the Streets", which is about a girl who "blossoms in a mud-puddle" and becomes a pitiful victim of circumstance. In the winter of 1893, Crane took the manuscript of "Maggie" to <a href="Richard%20Watson%20Gilder">Richard Watson Gilder</a>, who rejected it for publication in "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>".

Crane decided to publish it privately, with money he had inherited from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. The typewritten title page for the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> copyright application read simply: "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." The name "Maggie" was added to the title later. Crane used the pseudonym "Johnston Smith" for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the "nom de plume" was the "commonest name I could think of. I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of "<a href="The%20Arena%20%28magazine%29">The Arena</a>", calling it "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100 copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. He would later remember "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves."

In March 1893, Crane spent hours lounging in Linson's studio while having his portrait painted. He became fascinated with issues of the "Century" that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, "I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they "felt" in those scraps. They spout enough of what they "did", but they're as emotionless as rocks." Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson's studio, and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him. He would later state that he "had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood" and had imagined "war stories ever since he was out of <a href="knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a>." This novel would ultimately become "<a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a>".
From the beginning, Crane wished to show how it felt to be in a war by writing "a psychological portrayal of fear." Conceiving his story from the point of view of a young <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned by war's reality, Crane borrowed the private's surname, "Fleming", from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word. If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.

While working on his second novel, Crane remained prolific, concentrating on publishing stories to stave off poverty; "An Experiment in Misery", based on Crane's experiences in the Bowery, was printed by the "New York Press". He also wrote five or six poems a day. In early 1894, he showed some of his poems, or "lines" as he called them, to Hamlin Garland, who said he read "some thirty in all" with "growing wonder." Although Garland and William Dean Howells encouraged him to submit his poetry for publication, Crane's <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> was too unconventional for most. After brief wrangling between poet and publisher, Copeland & Day accepted Crane's first book of poems, "The Black Riders and Other Lines", although it would not be published until after "The Red Badge of Courage". He received a 10 percent royalty, and the publisher assured him that the book would be in a form "more severely classic than any book ever yet issued in America."

In the spring of 1894, Crane offered the finished manuscript of "The Red Badge of Courage" to "<a href="McClure%27s%20Magazine">McClure's Magazine</a>", which had become the foremost magazine for Civil War literature. While "McClure's" delayed giving him an answer on his novel, they offered him an assignment writing about the <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> <a href="coal%20mine">coal mine</a>s. "In the Depths of a Coal Mine", a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by "McClure's" in a number of newspapers, heavily edited. Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson: "Why the hell did they send me up there then? Do they want the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?"

Sources report that following an encounter with a male prostitute that spring, Crane began a novel on the subject entitled "<a href="Flowers%20of%20Asphalt">Flowers of Asphalt</a>," which he later abandoned. The manuscript has never been recovered.

After discovering that "McClure's" could not afford to pay him, Crane took his war novel to <a href="Irving%20Bacheller">Irving Bacheller</a> of the Bacheller-Johnson Newspaper Syndicate, which agreed to publish "The Red Badge of Courage" in serial form. Between the third and the ninth of December 1894, "The Red Badge of Courage" was published in some half-dozen newspapers in the United States. Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying "its quality [was] immediately felt and recognized." The lead editorial in the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Press">Philadelphia Press</a>" of December 7 said that Crane "is a new name now and unknown, but everybody will be talking about him if he goes on as he has begun".

At the end of January 1895, Crane left on what he called "a very long and circuitous newspaper trip" to the west. While writing feature articles for the Bacheller syndicate, he traveled to <a href="Saint%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">Saint Louis, Missouri</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston, Texas</a> and then <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. Irving Bacheller would later state that he "sent Crane to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> for new color", which the author found in the form of Mexican slum life. Whereas he found the lower class in New York pitiful, he was impressed by the "superiority" of the Mexican peasants' contentment and "even refuse[d] to pity them."

Returning to New York five months later, Crane joined the Lantern (alternately spelled "Lanthom" or "Lanthorne") Club organized by a group of young writers and journalists. The Club, located on the roof of an old house on <a href="William%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">William Street</a> near the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>, served as a <a href="public%20house">drinking establishment</a> of sorts and was decorated to look like a ship's cabin. There Crane ate one good meal a day, although friends were troubled by his "constant smoking, too much coffee, lack of food and poor teeth", as Nelson Greene put it. Living in near-poverty and greatly anticipating the publication of his books, Crane began work on two more novels: "The Third Violet" and "<a href="George%27s%20Mother">George's Mother</a>".

"The Black Riders" was published by Copeland & Day shortly before his return to New York in May, but it received mostly criticism, if not abuse, for the poems' unconventional style and use of free verse. A piece in the "Bookman" called Crane "the <a href="Aubrey%20Beardsley">Aubrey Beardsley</a> of poetry," and a commentator from the "<a href="Chicago%20Inter%20Ocean">Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean</a>" stated that "there is not a line of poetry from the opening to the closing page. <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Whitman</a>'s "<a href="Leaves%20of%20Grass">Leaves of Grass</a>" were luminous in comparison. Poetic lunacy would be a better name for the book." In June, the "New York Tribune" dismissed the book as "so much trash." Crane was pleased that the book was "making some stir".

In contrast to the reception for Crane's poetry, "The Red Badge of Courage" was welcomed with acclaim after its publication by <a href="D.%20Appleton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Appleton</a> in September 1895. For the next four months the book was in the top six on various bestseller lists around the country. It arrived on the literary scene "like a flash of lightning out of a clear winter sky", according to <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>, who was about 15 at the time. The novel also became popular in Britain; <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>, a future friend of Crane, wrote that the novel "detonated... with the impact and force of a twelve-inch shell charged with a very high explosive." Appleton published two, possibly three, printings in 1895 and as many as eleven more in 1896. Although some critics considered the work overly graphic and profane, it was widely heralded for its realistic portrayal of war and unique writing style. The "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" declared that "The Red Badge" would give readers "so vivid a picture of the emotions and the horrors of the battlefield that you will pray your eyes may never look upon the reality."

Wanting to capitalize on the success of "The Red Badge", McClure Syndicate offered Crane a contract to write a series on Civil War battlefields. Because it was a wish of his to "visit the battlefield—which I was to describe—at the time of year when it was fought", Crane agreed to take the assignment. Visiting battlefields in Northern <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, including <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a>, he would later produce five more Civil War tales: "Three Miraculous Soldiers", "The Veteran", "An Indiana Campaign", "An Episode of War" and "The Little Regiment".

At the age of 24, Crane, who was reveling in his success, became involved in a highly publicized case involving a suspected prostitute named Dora Clark. At 2 a.m. on September 16, 1896, he escorted two chorus girls and Clark from New York City's Broadway Garden, a popular "resort" where he had interviewed the women for a series he was writing. As Crane saw one woman safely to a <a href="tram">streetcar</a>, a plainclothes policeman named <a href="Charles%20Becker">Charles Becker</a> arrested the other two for <a href="solicitation">solicitation</a>; Crane was threatened with arrest when he tried to interfere. One of the women was released after Crane confirmed her erroneous claim that she was his wife, but Clark was charged and taken to the precinct. Against the advice of the arresting sergeant, Crane made a statement confirming Dora Clark's innocence, stating that "I only know that while with me she acted respectably, and that the policeman's charge was false." On the basis of Crane's testimony, Clark was discharged. The media seized upon the story; news spread to Philadelphia, <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and beyond, with papers focusing on Crane's courage. The Stephen Crane story, as it became known, soon became a source for ridicule; the "Chicago Dispatch" in particular quipped that "Stephen Crane is respectfully informed that association with women in scarlet is not necessarily a 'Red Badge of Courage' ".

A couple of weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of false arrest against the officer who had arrested her. The next day, the officer physically attacked Clark in the presence of witnesses for having brought charges against him. Crane, who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker's trial despite advice given to him from <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who was <a href="Police%20Commissioner">Police Commissioner</a> at the time and a new acquaintance of Crane. The defense targeted Crane: police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew him, trying to find incriminating evidence in order to lessen the effect of his testimony. A vigorous cross-examination took place that sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals; while the prosecution proved that he frequented brothels, Crane claimed this was merely for research purposes. After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, and Crane's reputation was ruined.

Given $700 in Spanish gold by the Bacheller-Johnson syndicate to work as a war correspondent in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> as the Spanish–American War was pending, the 25-year-old Crane left New York on November 27, 1896, on a train bound for <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Upon arrival in Jacksonville, he registered at the <a href="St.%20James%20Building">St. James Hotel</a> under the alias of Samuel Carleton to maintain anonymity while seeking passage to Cuba. While waiting for a boat, he toured the city and visited the local <a href="brothel">brothel</a>s. Within days he met 31-year-old <a href="Cora%20Crane">Cora Taylor</a>, proprietor of the downtown bawdy house Hotel de Dream. Born into a respectable Boston family, Taylor (whose legal name was Cora Ethel Stewart) had already had two brief marriages; her first husband, Vinton Murphy, divorced her on grounds of adultery. In 1889, she had married British Captain <a href="Donald%20William%20Stewart">Donald William Stewart</a>. She left him in 1892 for another man, but was still legally married. By the time Crane arrived, Taylor had been in Jacksonville for two years. She lived a <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian lifestyle</a>, owned a hotel of assignation, and was a well-known and respected local figure. The two spent much time together while Crane awaited his departure. He was finally cleared to leave for the Cuban port of Cienfuegos on New Year's Eve aboard the <a href="SS%20Commodore">SS "Commodore"</a>.
The ship sailed from Jacksonville with 27 or 28 men and a cargo of supplies and ammunition for the Cuban rebels. On the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River">St. Johns River</a> and less than from Jacksonville, "Commodore" struck a <a href="shoal">sandbar</a> in a dense fog and damaged its hull. Although towed off the sandbar the following day, it was beached again in <a href="Mayport">Mayport</a> and again damaged. A leak began in the boiler room that evening and, as a result of malfunctioning water pumps, the ship came to a standstill about from Mosquito Inlet. As the ship took on more water, Crane described the engine room as resembling "a scene at this time taken from the middle kitchen of <a href="hades">hades</a>." "Commodore"s lifeboats were lowered in the early hours of the morning on January 2, 1897 and the ship ultimately sank at 7 a.m. Crane was one of the last to leave the ship in a <a href="dinghy">dinghy</a>. In an ordeal that he recounted in the short story "<a href="The%20Open%20Boat">The Open Boat</a>", Crane and three other men (including the ship's Captain) floundered off the coast of Florida for a day and a half before trying to land the dinghy at <a href="Daytona%20Beach">Daytona Beach</a>. The small boat overturned in the surf, forcing the exhausted men to swim to shore; one of them died. Having lost the gold given to him for his journey, Crane wired Cora Taylor for help. She traveled to Daytona and returned to Jacksonville with Crane the next day, only four days after he had left on the "Commodore".

The disaster was reported on the front pages of newspapers across the country. Rumors that the ship had been sabotaged were widely circulated but never substantiated. Portrayed favorably and heroically by the press, Crane emerged from the ordeal with his reputation enhanced, if not restored, after the battering he had received in the Dora Clark affair. Meanwhile, Crane's affair with Taylor blossomed.

Three seasons of archaeological investigation were conducted in 2002-04 to examine and document the exposed remains of a wreck near <a href="Ponce%20Inlet%2C%20FL">Ponce Inlet, FL</a> conjectured to be that of the <a href="SS%20Commodore">SS "Commodore"</a>. The collected data, and other accumulated evidence, finally substantiated the identification of the "Commodore" beyond a reasonable doubt.

Despite contentment in Jacksonville and the need for rest after his ordeal, Crane became restless. He left Jacksonville on January 11 for New York City, where he applied for a passport to Cuba, Mexico and the West Indies. Spending three weeks in New York, he completed "The Open Boat" and periodically visited Port Jervis to see family. By this time, however, blockades had formed along the Florida coast as tensions rose with Spain, and Crane concluded that he would never be able to travel to Cuba. He sold "The Open Boat" to <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a> for $300 in early March. Determined to work as a war correspondent, Crane signed on with <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s "New York Journal" to cover the impending <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish conflict</a>. He brought along Taylor, who had sold the Hotel de Dream in order to follow him.
On March 20, they sailed first to England, where Crane was warmly received. They arrived in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey declared war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, "An Impression of the 'Concert' ". When he left for <a href="Epirus%20%28region%29">Epirus</a> in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent. She wrote under the pseudonym "Imogene Carter" for the "New York Journal", a job that Crane had secured for her. They wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately and together. The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks' assault on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek forces at Velestino. Crane wrote, "It is a great thing to survey the army of the enemy. Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description." During this battle, Crane encountered "a fat waddling puppy" that he immediately claimed, dubbing it "Velestino, the Journal dog". Greece and Turkey signed an armistice on May 20, ending the 30-day war; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, taking two Greek brothers as servants and Velestino the dog with them.

After staying in <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, for a few days, Crane and Taylor settled in Ravensbrook, a plain brick villa in <a href="Oxted">Oxted</a>. Referring to themselves as Mr. and Mrs. Crane, the couple lived openly in England, but Crane concealed the relationship from his friends and family in the United States. Admired in England, Crane thought himself attacked back home: "There seem so many of them in America who want to kill, bury and forget me purely out of unkindness and envy and—my unworthiness, if you choose", he wrote. Velestino the dog sickened and died soon after their arrival in England, on August 1. Crane, who had a great love for dogs, wrote an emotional letter to a friend an hour after the dog's death, stating that "for eleven days we fought death for him, thinking nothing of anything but his life." The Limpsfield-Oxted area was home to members of the socialist <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a> and a magnet for writers such as <a href="Edmund%20Gosse">Edmund Gosse</a>, <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a> and <a href="Edward%20Garnett">Edward Garnett</a>. Crane also met the Polish-born novelist <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> in October 1897, with whom he would have what Crane called a "warm and endless friendship".

Although Crane was confident among peers, strong negative reviews of the recently published "The Third Violet" were causing his literary reputation to dwindle. Reviewers were also highly critical of Crane's war letters, deeming them self-centered. Although "The Red Badge of Courage" had by this time gone through fourteen printings in the United States and six in England, Crane was running out of money. To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. He wrote in quick succession stories such as "The Monster", "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", "Death and the Child" and "The Blue Hotel". Crane began to attach price tags to his new works of fiction, hoping that "The Bride", for example, would fetch $175.

As 1897 ended, Crane's money crisis worsened. <a href="Amy%20Leslie">Amy Leslie</a>, a reporter from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and a former lover, sued him for $550. The "New York Times" reported that Leslie gave him $800 in November 1896 but that he'd repaid only a quarter of the sum. In February he was summoned to answer Leslie's claim. The claim was apparently settled out of court, because no record of adjudication exists. Meanwhile, Crane felt "heavy with troubles" and "chased to the wall" by expenses. He confided to his agent that he was $2,000 in debt but that he would "beat it" with more literary output.

Soon after the exploded in <a href="Havana%20Harbor">Havana Harbor</a> on February 15, 1898, under suspicious circumstances, Crane was offered a <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>60 advance by "<a href="Blackwood%27s%20Magazine">Blackwood's Magazine</a>" for articles "from the seat of war in the event of a war breaking out" between the United States and Spain. His health was failing, and it is believed that signs of his <a href="tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</a>, which he may have contracted in childhood, became apparent. With almost no money coming in from his finished stories, Crane accepted the assignment and left Oxted for New York. Taylor and the rest of the household stayed behind to fend off local creditors. Crane applied for a passport and left New York for <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a> two days before Congress declared war. While the war idled, he interviewed people and produced occasional copy.

In early June, he observed the establishment of an American base in Cuba when Marines seized <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>. He went ashore with the Marines, planning "to gather impressions and write them as the spirit moved." Although he wrote honestly about his fear in battle, others observed his calmness and composure. He would later recall "this prolonged tragedy of the night" in the war tale "Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo". After showing a willingness to serve during fighting at Cuzco, Cuba, by carrying messages to company commanders, Crane was officially cited for his "material aid during the action".

He continued to report upon various battles and the worsening military conditions and praised Theodore Roosevelt's <a href="Rough%20Riders">Rough Riders</a>, despite past tensions with the Commissioner. In early July, Crane was sent to the United States for medical treatment for a high fever. He was diagnosed with <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>, then <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Upon arrival in <a href="Old%20Point%20Comfort">Old Point Comfort</a>, Virginia, he spent a few weeks resting in a hotel. Although Crane had filed more than twenty dispatches in the three months he had covered the war, the "World"'s business manager believed that the paper had not received its money's worth and fired him. In retaliation, Crane signed with Hearst's "New York Journal" with the wish to return to Cuba. He traveled first to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and then to Havana. In September, rumors began to spread that Crane, who was working anonymously, had either been killed or disappeared. He sporadically sent out dispatches and stories; he wrote about the mood in Havana, the crowded city sidewalks, and other topics, but he was soon desperate for money again. Taylor, left alone in England, was also penniless. She became frantic with worry over her lover's whereabouts; they were not in direct communication until the end of the year. Crane left Havana and arrived in England on January 11, 1899.

Rent on Ravensbrook had not been paid for a year. Upon returning to England, Crane secured a solicitor to act as guarantor for their debts, after which Crane and Taylor relocated to Brede Place. This manor in Sussex, which dated to the 14th century and had neither electricity nor indoor plumbing, was offered to them by friends at a modest rent. The relocation appeared to give hope to Crane, but his money problems continued. Deciding that he could no longer afford to write for American publications, he concentrated on publishing in English magazines.

Crane pushed himself to write feverishly during the first months at Brede; he told his publisher that he was "doing more work now than I have at any other period in my life". His health worsened, and by late 1899 he was asking friends about health resorts. "The Monster and Other Stories" was in production and "War Is Kind", his second collection of poems, was published in the United States in May. None of his books after "The Red Badge of Courage" had sold well, and he bought a <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a> to spur output. "Active Service", a novella based on Crane's correspondence experience, was published in October. The "New York Times" reviewer questioned "whether the author of 'Active Service' himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero."
In December, the couple held an elaborate Christmas party at Brede, attended by Conrad, <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and other friends; it lasted several days. On December 29 Crane suffered a severe <a href="pulmonary%20hemorrhage">pulmonary hemorrhage</a>. In January 1900 he'd recovered sufficiently to work on a new novel, "The O'Ruddy", completing 25 of the 33 chapters. Plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to write sketches from <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, the site of a <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer</a> prison, but at the end of March and in early April he suffered two more hemorrhages. Taylor took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid. The couple planned to travel on the continent, but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked that his friend's "wasted face was enough to tell me that it was the most forlorn of all hopes."

On May 28, the couple arrived at <a href="Badenweiler">Badenweiler</a>, Germany, a health spa on the edge of the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>. Despite his weakened condition, Crane continued to dictate fragmentary episodes for the completion of "The O'Ruddy". He died on June 5, 1900, at the age of 28. In his will he left everything to Taylor, who took his body to New Jersey for burial. Crane was interred in <a href="Evergreen%20Cemetery%2C%20Hillside">Evergreen Cemetery</a> in what is now Hillside, New Jersey.

Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as representative of <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">Naturalism</a>, <a href="American%20realism">American realism</a>, <a href="Impressionism%20%28literature%29">Impressionism</a> or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, ""Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,"" that the work presents a "symbiosis" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether or not he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he "dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow." Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and <a href="Impressionism">Impressionist painting</a>—including the use of color and <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon "the great influence of the studio" on Crane's work, quoting a passage from "The Red Badge of Courage" as an example: "At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects." Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected <a href="Sentimentalism%20%28literature%29">sentimentality</a>, asserting that "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true."
Poet and biographer <a href="John%20Berryman">John Berryman</a> suggested that there were three basic variations, or "norms", of Crane's narrative style. The first, being "flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous", is best exemplified in "The Red Badge of Courage", while the second ("supple majesty") is believed to relate to "The Open Boat", and the third ("much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax") to later works such as "The Monster". Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and <a href="Ellipsis">ellipses</a> between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all.

Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DtEFHFVi14L8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA39%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA39%26amp%3Bdq%3Dslum%2Bfiction%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3DpqulVK_Asw%26amp%3Bsig%3DK50Th7eFhP4MsojA38Y-xK4KNUQ%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bei%3DfaDlVMSTDcGD8gWvjYDwDA%26amp%3Bved%3D0CE0Q6AEwCA%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dslum%2520fiction%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse">slum fiction</a>; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed by the brashness of the Bowery's crude dialect and profanity, which he used lavishly. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: "Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'."

Crane's work is often thematically driven by Naturalistic and Realistic concerns, including ideals versus realities, spiritual crises and fear. These themes are particularly evident in Crane's first three novels, "Maggie: A Girl of the Streets", "The Red Badge of Courage" and "George's Mother". The three main characters search for a way to make their dreams come true, but ultimately suffer from crises of identity. Crane was fascinated by war and death, as well as fire, disfigurement, fear and courage, all of which inspired him to write many works based on these concepts. In "The Red Badge of Courage", the main character both longs for the heroics of battle but ultimately fears it, demonstrating the dichotomy of courage and cowardice. He experiences the threat of death, misery and a loss of self.

Extreme isolation from society and community is also apparent in Crane's work. During the most intense battle scenes in "The Red Badge of Courage", for example, the story's focus is mainly "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others". In "The Open Boat", "An Experiment in Misery" and other stories, Crane uses light, motion and color to express degrees of epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. "The Open Boat", for example, distances itself from <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> optimism and affirmation of man's place in the world by concentrating on the characters' isolation.

While he lived, Stephen Crane was denominated by critical readers a realist, a naturalist, an impressionist, symbolist, "Symboliste", expressionist and ironist; his posthumous life was enriched by critics who read him as nihilistic, existentialist, a neo-Romantic, a sentimentalist, protomodernist, pointilliste, visionist, imagist and, by his most recent biographer, a “bleak naturalist.” At midcentury he was a “predisciple of the New Criticism”; by its end he was “a proto-deconstructionist anti-artist hero” who had “leapfrogged modernism, landing on postmodernist ground.” Or, as Sergio Perosa wrote in 1964, “The critic wanders in a labyrinth of possibilities, which every new turn taken by Crane’s fiction seems to explode or deny.”

One undeniable fact about Crane's work, as Anthony Splendora noted in 2015, is that Death haunts it; like a threatening eclipse it overshadows his best efforts, each of which features the signal demise of a main character. Allegorically, "The Blue Hotel," at the pinnacle of the short story form, may even be an "autothanatography", the author's intentional exteriorization or objectification, in this case for the purpose of purgation, of his own impending death. Crane's "Swede" in that story can be taken, following current psychoanalytical theory, as a surrogative, sacrificial victim, ritually to be purged.

Transcending this "dark circumstance of composition," Crane had a particular telos and impetus for his creation: beyond the tautologies that all art is alterity and to some formal extent mimesis, Crane sought and obviously found "a form of catharsis" in writing. This view accounts for his uniqueness, especially as operative through his notorious "disgust" with his family's religion, their "vacuous, futile psalm-singing". His favorite book, for example, was Mark Twain's "Life on the Mississippi", in which God is mentioned only twice—once as irony and once as "a swindle." Not only did Crane call out God specifically with the lines "Well then I hate thee / righteous image" in "The Black Riders" (1895), but even his most hopeful tropes, such as the "comradeship" of his "Open Boat" survivors, make no mention of deity, specifying only "indifferent nature." His antitheism is most evident in his characterization of the human race as "lice clinging to a space-lost bulb," a climax-nearing speech in "The Blue Hotel," Ch. VI. It is possible that Crane utilized religion's formal psychic space, now suddenly available resulting from the recent "Death of God", as a milieu for his compensative art.

Beginning with the publication of "" in 1893, Crane was recognized by critics mainly as a novelist. "Maggie" was initially rejected by numerous publishers because of its atypical and true-to-life depictions of class warfare, which clashed with the sentimental tales of that time. Rather than focusing on the very rich or middle class, the novel's characters are lower-class denizens of New York's Bowery. The main character, Maggie, descends into prostitution after being led astray by her lover. Although the novel's plot is simple, its dramatic mood, quick pace and portrayal of Bowery life have made it memorable. "Maggie" is not merely an account of slum life, but also represents eternal symbols. In his first draft, Crane did not give his characters proper names. Instead, they were identified by epithets: Maggie, for example, was the girl who "blossomed in a mud-puddle" and Pete, her seducer, was a "knight". The novel is dominated by bitter irony and anger, as well as destructive morality and treacherous sentiment. Critics would later call the novel "the first dark flower of American Naturalism" for its distinctive elements of naturalistic fiction.
Written thirty years after the end of the Civil War and before Crane had any experience of battle, "The Red Badge of Courage" was innovative stylistically as well as psychologically. Often described as a <a href="war%20novel">war novel</a>, it focuses less on battle and more on the main character's psyche and his reactions and responses in war. It is believed that Crane based the fictional battle in the novel on that of <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a>; he may also have interviewed veterans of the <a href="124th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms, in Port Jervis, New York. Told in a <a href="third-person%20narrative">third-person limited point of view</a>, it reflects the private experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat. "The Red Badge of Courage" is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which help create suspense within the story. Similarly, by substituting epithets for characters' names ("the youth", "the tattered soldier"), Crane injects an <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> quality into his work, making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man. Like Crane's first novel, "The Red Badge of Courage" has a deeply <a href="irony">ironic</a> tone which increases in severity as the novel progresses. The title of the work is ironic; Henry wishes "that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> soldier) is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.

The novel expresses a strong connection between humankind and nature, a frequent and prominent concern in Crane's fiction and poetry throughout his career. Whereas contemporary writers (<a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>, <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>) focused on a sympathetic bond on the two elements, Crane wrote from the perspective that human consciousness distanced humans from nature. In "The Red Badge of Courage", this distance is paired with a great number of references to animals, and men with animalistic characteristics: people "howl", "squawk", "growl", or "snarl".

Since the resurgence of Crane's popularity in the 1920s, "The Red Badge of Courage" has been deemed a major American text. The novel has been anthologized numerous times, including in the 1942 collection "", edited by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. In the introduction, Hemingway wrote that the novel "is one of the finest books of our literature, and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is."

Crane's later novels have not received as much critical praise. After the success of "The Red Badge of Courage", Crane wrote another tale set in the Bowery. "George's Mother" is less allegorical and more personal than his two previous novels, and it focuses on the conflict between a church-going, temperance-adhering woman (thought to be based on Crane's mother) and her single remaining offspring, who is a naive dreamer. Critical response to the novel was mixed. "The Third Violet", a romance that he wrote quickly after publishing "The Red Badge of Courage", is typically considered as Crane's attempt to appeal to popular audiences. Crane considered it a "quiet little story." Although it contained autobiographical details, the characters have been deemed inauthentic and stereotypical. Crane's second to last novel, "Active Service", revolves around the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, with which the author was familiar. Although noted for its <a href="satire">satirical</a> take on the <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>tic and highly passionate works that were popular of the nineteenth century, the novel was not successful. It is generally accepted by critics that Crane's work suffered at this point due to the speed which he wrote in order to meet his high expenses. His last novel, a suspenseful and <a href="picaresque">picaresque</a> work entitled "The O'Ruddy", was finished posthumously by <a href="Robert%20Barr%20%28writer%29">Robert Barr</a> and published in 1903.

Crane wrote many different types of fictional pieces while indiscriminately applying to them terms such as "story", "tale" and "sketch". For this reason, critics have found clear-cut classification of Crane's work problematic. While "The Open Boat" and "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" are often considered short stories, others are variously identified.
In an 1896 interview with Herbert P. Williams, a reporter for the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>", Crane said that he did "not find that short stories are utterly different in character from other fiction. It seems to me that short stories are the easiest things we write." During his brief literary career, he wrote more than a hundred short stories and fictional sketches. Crane's early fiction was based in camping expeditions in his teen years; these stories eventually became known as "The Sullivan County Tales and Sketches". He considered these "sketches", which are mostly humorous and not of the same caliber of work as his later fiction, to be "articles of many kinds," in that they are part fiction and part journalism.

The subject matter for his stories varied extensively. His early New York City sketches and Bowery tales accurately described the results of industrialization, immigration and the growth of cities and their slums. His collection of six short stories, "The Little Regiment", covered familiar ground with the American Civil War, a subject for which he became famous with "The Red Badge of Courage". Although similar to Crane's noted novel, "The Little Regiment" was believed to lack vigor and originality. Realizing the limitations of these tales, Crane wrote: "I have invented the sum of my invention with regard to war and this story keeps me in internal despair."

"The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure" (1898) contains thirteen short stories that deal with three periods in Crane's life: his <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park</a> boyhood, his trip to the West and Mexico in 1895, and his Cuban adventure in 1897. This collection was well received and included several of his most critically successful works. His 1899 collection, "The Monster and Other Stories", was similarly well received.

Two posthumously published collections were not as successful. In August 1900 "The Whilomville Stories" were published, a collection of thirteen stories that Crane wrote during the last year of his life. The work deals almost exclusively with boyhood, and the stories are drawn from events occurring in Port Jervis, where Crane lived from the age of six to eleven. Focusing on small-town America, the stories tend toward sentimentality, but remain perceptive of the lives of children. "Wounds in the Rain", published in September 1900, contains fictional tales based on Crane's reports for the "World" and the "Journal" during the Spanish–American War. These stories, which Crane wrote while desperately ill, include "The Price of the Harness" and "The Lone Charge of William B. Perkins" and are dramatic, ironic and sometimes humorous.

Despite Crane's prolific output, only four stories--"The Open Boat", "The Blue Hotel", "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", and "The Monster"—have received extensive attention from scholars. H. G. Wells considered "The Open Boat" to be "beyond all question, the crown of all his work", and it is one of the most frequently discussed of Crane's works.

Crane's poems, which he preferred to call "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926. Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was "to give my ideas of life as a whole, so far as I know it". The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, "The Black Riders and Other Lines" and "War is Kind", was unconventional for the time in that it was written in <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> without <a href="rhyme">rhyme</a>, <a href="meter%20%28poetry%29">meter</a>, or even titles for individual works. They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most do not. Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that his work contains <a href="allegory">allegory</a>, <a href="dialectic">dialectic</a> and narrative situations.

Critic Ruth Miller claimed that Crane wrote "an intellectual poetry rather than a poetry that evokes feeling, a poetry that stimulates the mind rather than arouses the heart". In the most complexly organized poems, the significance of the states of mind or feelings is ambiguous, but Crane's poems tend to affirm certain elemental attitudes, beliefs, opinions and stances toward God, man and the universe. "The Black Riders" in particular is essentially a dramatic concept and the poems provide continuity within the dramatic structure. There is also a dramatic interplay in which there is frequently a major voice reporting an incident seen ("In the desert / I saw a creature, naked, bestial") or experienced ("A learned man came to me once"). The second voice or additional voices represent a point of view which is revealed to be inferior; when these clash, a dominant attitude emerges.

In four years, Crane published five novels, two volumes of poetry, three short story collections, two books of war stories, and numerous works of short fiction and reporting. Today he is mainly remembered for "The Red Badge of Courage", which is regarded as an American classic. The novel has been adapted several times for the screen, including <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>'s 1951 <a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage%20%28film%29">version</a>. By the time of his death, Crane had become one of the best known writers of his generation. His eccentric lifestyle, frequent newspaper reporting, association with other famous authors, and <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> status made him somewhat of an international celebrity. Although most stories about his life tended toward the romantic, rumors about his alleged drug use and alcoholism persisted long after his death.

By the early 1920s, Crane and his work were nearly forgotten. It was not until <a href="Thomas%20Beer">Thomas Beer</a> published his biography in 1923, which was followed by editor <a href="Wilson%20Follett">Wilson Follett</a>'s "The Work of Stephen Crane" (1925–1927), that Crane's writing came to the attention of a scholarly audience. Crane's reputation was then enhanced by faithful support from writer friends such as Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells and <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, all of whom either published recollections or commented upon their time with Crane. <a href="John%20Berryman">John Berryman</a>'s 1950 biography of Crane further established him as an important American author. Since 1951 there has been a steady outpouring of articles, monographs and reprints in Crane scholarship.

Today, Crane is considered one of the most innovative writers of the 1890s. His peers, including Conrad and James, as well as later writers such as <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> and <a href="Willa%20Cather">Willa Cather</a>, hailed Crane as one of the finest creative spirits of his time. His work was described by Wells as "the first expression of the opening mind of a new period, or, at least, the early emphatic phase of a new initiative." Wells said that "beyond dispute", Crane was "the best writer of our generation, and his untimely death was an irreparable loss to our literature." Conrad wrote that Crane was an "artist" and "a seer with a gift for rendering the significant on the surface of things and with an incomparable insight into primitive emotions". Crane's work has proved inspirational for future writers; not only have scholars drawn similarities between Hemingway's "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms">A Farewell to Arms</a>" and "The Red Badge of Courage", but Crane's fiction is thought to have been an important inspiration for Hemingway and his fellow <a href="Modernism">Modernists</a>. In 1936, Hemingway wrote in "<a href="The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Africa">The Green Hills of Africa</a>" that "The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>. That's not the order they're good in. There is no order for good writers." Crane's poetry is thought to have been a precursor to the <a href="Imagism">Imagist</a> movement, and his short fiction has also influenced American literature. "The Open Boat", "The Blue Hotel", "The Monster" and "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" are generally considered by critics to be examples of Crane's best work.

Several institutions and places have endeavored to keep Crane's legacy alive. Badenweiler and the house where he died became something of a tourist attraction for its fleeting association with the American author; <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a> attested to the fact that, long after Crane's death, tourists would be directed to the room where he died. <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> Rare Book and Manuscript Library has a collection of Crane and Taylor's personal correspondence dating from 1895 to 1908. Near his brother Edmund's Sullivan County home in New York, where Crane stayed for a short time, a pond is named after him. The Stephen Crane House in <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park, New Jersey</a>, where the author lived with his siblings for nine years, is operated as a museum dedicated to his life and work. Syracuse University has an annual Stephen Crane Lecture Series which is sponsored by the Dikaia Foundation.

<a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> purchased much of the Stephen Crane materials held by Cora Crane at her death. The Crane Collection is one of the largest in the nation of his materials. Columbia University had an exhibit: " 'The Tall Swift Shadow of a Ship at Night': Stephen and Cora Crane", November 2, 1995 through February 16, 1996, about the lives of the couple, featuring letters and other documents and memorabilia.

Ian Fleming

Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an English author, journalist and <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">naval intelligence officer</a> who is best known for his <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> series of <a href="spy%20novel">spy novel</a>s. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank <a href="Robert%20Fleming%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Robert Fleming & Co.</a>, and his father was the Member of Parliament for <a href="Henley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Henley</a> from 1910 until his death on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in 1917. Educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Sandhurst</a> and, briefly, the universities of <a href="Munich%20University">Munich</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Geneva">Geneva</a>, Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.

While working for Britain's <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a> during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning <a href="Operation%20Goldeneye">Operation Goldeneye</a> and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, <a href="30%20Assault%20Unit">30 Assault Unit</a> and <a href="T-Force">T-Force</a>. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">James Bond novels</a>.

Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>", in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolved around <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">MI6</a>. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">commander</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a>. The Bond stories rank among <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20books%23At%20least%20100%20million%20copies">the best-selling series of fictional books</a> of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story "<a href="Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang">Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang</a>" and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" ranked Fleming 14th on its list of "The 50 greatest <a href="British%20literature">British writers</a> since 1945".

Fleming was married to <a href="Ann%20Fleming">Ann Charteris</a>, who was divorced from the second <a href="Esmond%20Harmsworth%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Rothermere">Viscount Rothermere</a> because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has <a href="James%20Bond%20filmography">appeared in film</a> twenty-six times, portrayed by seven actors.

Ian Lancaster Fleming was born on 28 May 1908, at 27 <a href="Green%20Street%2C%20Mayfair">Green Street</a> in the wealthy London district of <a href="Mayfair">Mayfair</a>. His mother was <a href="Evelyn%20St.%20Croix%20Fleming">Evelyn</a> ("" Rose), and his father was <a href="Valentine%20Fleming">Valentine Fleming</a>, the Member of Parliament for <a href="Henley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Henley</a> from 1910 to 1917. As an infant he briefly lived, with his family, at <a href="Braziers%20Park">Braziers Park</a> in Oxfordshire. Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier <a href="Robert%20Fleming%20%28financier%29">Robert Fleming</a>, who founded the Scottish American Investment Trust and the merchant bank <a href="Robert%20Fleming%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Robert Fleming & Co.</a>

In 1914, with the start of the First World War, <a href="Valentine%20Fleming">Valentine Fleming</a> joined <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">"C" Squadron</a>, <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Oxfordshire%20Hussars">Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars</a>, and rose to the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>. He was killed by German shelling on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> on 20 May 1917; <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> wrote an obituary that appeared in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". Because the family owned an estate at <a href="Arnisdale">Arnisdale</a>, Valentine's death was commemorated on the <a href="Glenelg%2C%20Highland">Glenelg</a> War Memorial.

Fleming's elder brother <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28writer%29">Peter</a> (1907–1971) became a travel writer and married actress <a href="Celia%20Johnson">Celia Johnson</a>. Peter served with the <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> during the Second World War, was later commissioned under <a href="Colin%20Gubbins">Colin Gubbins</a> to help establish the <a href="Auxiliary%20Units">Auxiliary Units</a>, and became involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.

Fleming also had two younger brothers, Michael (1913–1940) and Richard (1911–1977), and a younger maternal half-sister born out of wedlock, the cellist <a href="Amaryllis%20Fleming">Amaryllis Fleming</a> (1925–1999), whose father was the artist <a href="Augustus%20John">Augustus John</a>. Amaryllis was conceived during a long-term affair between John and Evelyn that started in 1923, six years after the death of Valentine.

In 1914 Fleming attended <a href="Durnford%20School">Durnford School</a>, a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28UK%29">preparatory school</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Purbeck">Isle of Purbeck</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. He did not enjoy his time at Durnford; he suffered unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying.

In 1921 Fleming enrolled at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>. Not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics and held the title of "<a href="Victor%20Ludorum">Victor Ludorum</a>" ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, "The Wyvern". His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a <a href="Cram%20school">crammer</a> course to gain entry to the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College</a> at Sandhurst. He spent less than a year there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>.

In 1927, to prepare Fleming for possible entry into the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a>, his mother sent him to the Tennerhof in <a href="Kitzb%C3%BChel">Kitzbühel</a>, Austria, a small private school run by the <a href="Adlerian">Adlerian</a> disciple and former British spy Ernan Forbes Dennis and his novelist wife, <a href="Phyllis%20Bottome">Phyllis Bottome</a>. After improving his language skills there, he studied briefly at <a href="Munich%20University">Munich University</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Geneva">University of Geneva</a>. While in Geneva, Fleming began a romance with Monique Panchaud de Bottens and the couple were briefly engaged in 1931. His mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship. He applied for entry to the Foreign Office, but failed the examinations. His mother again intervened in his affairs, lobbying Sir Roderick Jones, head of <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> News Agency, and in October 1931 he was given a position as a <a href="sub-editor">sub-editor</a> and journalist for the company. In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow, where he covered the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> <a href="show%20trial">show trial</a> of six engineers from the British company <a href="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a>. While there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising for not being able to attend.

Fleming bowed to family pressure in October 1933, and went into banking with a position at the financiers Cull & Co. In 1935 he moved to Rowe and Pitman on <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a> as a stockbroker. Fleming was unsuccessful in both roles. Early in 1939 Fleming began an affair with Ann O'Neill (née Charteris), who was married to the <a href="Baron%20O%27Neill">3rd Baron O'Neill</a>; she was also having an affair with <a href="Esmond%20Harmsworth%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Rothermere">Esmond Harmsworth</a>, the heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the "Daily Mail".

In May 1939 Fleming was recruited by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Henry%20Godfrey">John Godfrey</a>, <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Director of Naval Intelligence</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, to become his <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a>. He joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, with the codename "17F", and worked out of Room 39 at <a href="Ripley%20Building">The Admiralty</a>. Fleming's biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, notes that Fleming had "no obvious qualifications" for the role. As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve</a> in July 1939, initially as <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a>, but promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> a few months later.

Fleming proved invaluable as Godfrey's personal assistant and excelled in administration. Godfrey was known as an abrasive character who made enemies within government circles. He frequently used Fleming as a liaison with other sections of the government's wartime administration, such as the <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a>, the <a href="Political%20Warfare%20Executive">Political Warfare Executive</a>, the <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE), the <a href="Joint%20Intelligence%20Committee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>'s staff.

On 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the war, Godfrey circulated a memorandum that, "bore all the hallmarks of ... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian <a href="Ben%20Macintyre">Ben Macintyre</a>. It was called the <a href="Trout%20Memo">Trout Memo</a> and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a>. The memo contained several schemes to be considered for use against the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> to lure <a href="U-boats">U-boats</a> and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to <a href="Operation%20Mincemeat">Operation Mincemeat</a>, the 1943 plan to conceal the <a href="operation%20Husky">intended invasion of Italy</a> from North Africa, which was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: "The following suggestion is used in a book by <a href="Basil%20Thomson">Basil Thomson</a>: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one."

In 1940 Fleming and Godfrey contacted <a href="Kenneth%20Mason%20%28geographer%29">Kenneth Mason</a>, Professor of Geography at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford University</a>, about the preparation of reports on the geography of countries involved in military operations. These reports were the precursors of the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Handbooks">"Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series"</a> produced between 1941 and 1946.

<a href="Operation%20Ruthless">Operation Ruthless</a>, a plan aimed at obtaining details of the <a href="Cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Enigma%23German%20Navy%203-rotor%20Enigma">Enigma codes</a> used by <a href="Kriegsmarine">Nazi Germany's navy</a>, was instigated by a memo written by Fleming to Godfrey on 12 September 1940. The idea was to "obtain" a German bomber, man it with a German-speaking crew dressed in Luftwaffe uniforms, and crash it into the English Channel. The crew would then attack their German rescuers and bring their boat and <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma machine</a> back to England. Much to the annoyance of <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> and <a href="Peter%20Twinn">Peter Twinn</a> at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>, the mission was never carried out. According to Fleming's niece, <a href="Lucy%20Fleming">Lucy</a>, an official of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> pointed out that if they were to drop a downed <a href="Heinkel">Heinkel</a> bomber in the English Channel, it would probably sink rather quickly.

Fleming also worked with Colonel <a href="William%20Joseph%20Donovan">"Wild Bill" Donovan</a>, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s special representative on intelligence co-operation between London and Washington. In May 1941 Fleming accompanied Godfrey to the United States, where he assisted in writing a <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a> for the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Coordinator%20of%20Information">Office of the Coordinator of Information</a>, the department that turned into the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> and eventually became the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>.

Admiral Godfrey put Fleming in charge of <a href="Operation%20Goldeneye">Operation Goldeneye</a> between 1941 and 1942; Goldeneye was a plan to maintain an intelligence framework in Spain in the event of a German takeover of the territory. Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.

In 1942 Fleming formed a unit of <a href="British%20Commandos">commandos</a>, known as <a href="No.%2030%20Commando">No. 30 Commando</a> or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. 30AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance—sometimes in front of it—to seize enemy documents from previously targeted headquarters. The unit was based on a German group headed by <a href="Otto%20Skorzeny">Otto Skorzeny</a>, who had undertaken similar activities in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> in May 1941. The German unit was thought by Fleming to be "one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence".

Fleming did not fight in the field with the unit, but selected targets and directed operations from the rear. On its formation the unit was thirty strong, but it grew to five times that size. The unit was filled with men from other commando units, and trained in unarmed combat, safe-cracking and lock-picking at the SOE facilities. In late 1942 <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> (later <a href="Rear-Admiral%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Rear-Admiral</a>) Edmund Rushbrooke replaced Godfrey as head of the Naval Intelligence Division, and Fleming's influence in the organisation declined, although he retained control over 30AU. Fleming was unpopular with the unit's members, who disliked his referring to them as his "Red Indians".

Before the 1944 <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>, most of 30AU's operations were in the Mediterranean, and it also secretly participated in the <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a> in a failed pinch raid for an Enigma machine and related materials. Fleming observed the raid from <a href="HMS%20Fernie%20%28L11%29">HMS "Fernie"</a>, 700 yards offshore. Because of its successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU became greatly trusted by naval intelligence.

In March 1944 Fleming oversaw the distribution of intelligence to Royal Navy units in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>. He was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944, but maintained some involvement. He visited 30AU in the field during and after Overlord, especially following an attack on <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> for which he was concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force rather than an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised. He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870.

In December 1944 Fleming was posted on an intelligence fact-finding trip to the Far East on behalf of the Director of Naval Intelligence. Much of the trip was spent identifying opportunities for 30AU in the Pacific; the unit saw little action because of the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japanese surrender</a>.

The success of 30AU led to the August 1944 decision to establish a "Target Force", which became known as <a href="T-Force">T-Force</a>. The official memorandum, held at <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The National Archives</a> in London, describes the unit's primary role: "T-Force = Target Force, to guard and secure documents, persons, equipment, with combat and Intelligence personnel, after capture of large towns, ports etc. in liberated and enemy territory."

Fleming sat on the committee that selected the targets for the T-Force unit, and listed them in the "Black Books" that were issued to the unit's officers. The infantry component of T-Force was in part made up of the 5th Battalion, <a href="King%27s%20Regiment">King's Regiment</a>, which supported the <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Army</a>. It was responsible for securing targets of interest for the British military, including nuclear laboratories, gas research centres and individual rocket scientists. The unit's most notable discoveries came during the advance on the German port of <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, in the research centre for German engines used in the <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a>, <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20163">Messerschmitt Me 163</a> fighters and high-speed U-boats. Fleming would later use elements of the activities of T-Force in his writing, particularly in his 1955 Bond novel "<a href="Moonraker%20%28novel%29">Moonraker</a>".

In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, he decided to live on the island once the war was over. His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in <a href="Saint%20Mary%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint Mary Parish</a> where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye</a>. The name of the house and estate where he wrote his novels has many possible sources. Fleming himself mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye and <a href="Carson%20McCullers">Carson McCullers</a>' 1941 novel "<a href="Reflections%20in%20a%20Golden%20Eye%20%28novel%29">Reflections in a Golden Eye</a>", which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the American navy.

Fleming was awarded the Danish Frihedsmedalje in October 1947 for his contribution in assisting Danish officers escaping from Denmark to Britain during the occupation of Denmark.

Upon Fleming's <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20British%20Armed%20Forces%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War">demobilisation</a> in May 1945, he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>". In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take three months holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica. Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.

After Ann Charteris' first husband died in the war, she expected to marry Fleming, but he decided to remain a bachelor. On 28 June 1945, she married the <a href="Esmond%20Harmsworth%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Rothermere">second Viscount Rothermere</a>. Nevertheless, Charteris continued her affair with Fleming, travelling to Jamaica to see him under the pretext of visiting his friend and neighbour <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>. In 1948 she gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was <a href="Stillbirth">stillborn</a>. Rothermere divorced Charteris in 1951 because of her relationship with Fleming, and the couple married on 24 March 1952 in Jamaica, a few months before their son Caspar was born in August. Both Fleming and Ann had affairs during their marriage, she with <a href="Hugh%20Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a>, the <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Leader of the Labour Party</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>. Fleming had a long-term affair in Jamaica with one of his neighbours, <a href="Blanche%20Blackwell">Blanche Blackwell</a>, the mother of <a href="Chris%20Blackwell">Chris Blackwell</a> of <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>.

Fleming had first mentioned to friends during the war that he wanted to write a spy novel, an ambition he achieved within two months with <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">"Casino Royale"</a>. He started writing the book at Goldeneye on 17 February 1952, gaining inspiration from his own experiences and imagination. He claimed afterwards that he wrote the novel to distract himself from his forthcoming wedding to the pregnant Charteris, and called the work his "dreadful oafish opus". His manuscript was typed in London by Joan Howe (mother of travel writer <a href="Rory%20MacLean">Rory MacLean</a>), and Fleming's red-haired secretary at "The Times" on whom the character <a href="Miss%20Moneypenny">Miss Moneypenny</a> was partially based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym.

During "Casino Royale's" final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a> to see a copy, and remarked "so far as I can see the element of suspense is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 "Casino Royale" was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">10s 6d</a>, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed to cope with the demand.

The novel centres on the exploits of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">MI6</a>. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">commander</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a>. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Bond%20%28ornithologist%29">James Bond</a>, an expert on <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> birds and author of the definitive field guide "<a href="Birds%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">Birds of the West Indies</a>". Fleming, himself a keen <a href="Birdwatching">birdwatcher</a>, had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". In a 1962 interview in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", he further explained: "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard."

Fleming based his creation on individuals he met during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division, and admitted that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war". Among those types were his brother Peter, whom he worshipped, and who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Fleming envisaged that Bond would resemble the composer, singer and actor <a href="Hoagy%20Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>; others, such as author and historian <a href="Ben%20Macintyre">Ben Macintyre</a>, identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond. General references in the novels describe Bond as having "dark, rather cruel good looks".

Fleming also modelled aspects of Bond on <a href="Conrad%20O%27Brien-ffrench">Conrad O'Brien-ffrench</a>, a spy whom Fleming had met while skiing in Kitzbühel in the 1930s, <a href="Patrick%20Dalzel-Job">Patrick Dalzel-Job</a>, who served with distinction in 30AU during the war, and <a href="Wilfred%20Dunderdale">Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale</a>, station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce</a>. <a href="Sir%20Fitzroy%20Maclean%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Fitzroy Maclean</a> was another possible model for Bond, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, as was the MI6 <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> <a href="Du%C5%A1ko%20Popov">Duško Popov</a>. Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including the same golf handicap, his taste for scrambled eggs, his love of gambling, and use of the same brand of toiletries.

After the publication of "Casino Royale", Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two ("<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Golden%20Gun%20%28novel%29">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>" and "<a href="Octopussy%20and%20The%20Living%20Daylights">Octopussy and The Living Daylights</a>") posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The plot of <a href="From%20Russia%2C%20with%20Love%20%28novel%29">"From Russia, with Love"</a> uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had its roots in the wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a> was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>.
Many of the names used in the Bond works came from people Fleming knew: <a href="Francisco%20Scaramanga">Scaramanga</a>, the principal villain in "The Man with the Golden Gun", was named after a fellow Eton schoolboy with whom Fleming fought; <a href="Auric%20Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a>, from the eponymous novel, was named after British architect <a href="Ern%C5%91%20Goldfinger">Ernő Goldfinger</a>, whose work Fleming abhorred; Sir <a href="Hugo%20Drax">Hugo Drax</a>, the antagonist of "Moonraker", was named after Fleming's acquaintance <a href="Reginald%20Plunkett">Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax</a>; Drax's assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's <a href="Hans%20Krebs%20%28Wehrmacht%20general%29">last Chief of Staff</a>; and one of the homosexual villains from <a href="Diamonds%20Are%20Forever%20%28novel%29">"Diamonds Are Forever"</a>, "Boofy" Kidd, was named after one of Fleming's close friends—and a relative of his wife—<a href="Arthur%20Gore%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Arran">Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran</a>, known as Boofy to his friends.

Fleming's first work of non-fiction, "<a href="The%20Diamond%20Smugglers">The Diamond Smugglers</a>", was published in 1957 and was partly based on background research for his fourth Bond novel, "Diamonds Are Forever". Much of the material had appeared in "The Sunday Times" and was based on Fleming's interviews with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation who had previously worked in <a href="MI5">MI5</a>. The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US.

For the first five books ("Casino Royale", <a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28novel%29">"Live and Let Die"</a>, "Moonraker", "Diamonds Are Forever" and "From Russia, with Love") Fleming received broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when <a href="Bernard%20Bergonzi">Bernard Bergonzi</a>, in the journal "Twentieth Century", attacked Fleming's work as containing "a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism" and wrote that the books showed "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with <a href="John%20Buchan%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tweedsmuir">John Buchan</a> and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28novel%29">Dr. No</a>" was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism from reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, "rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Paul Johnson</a> of the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>", who, in his review "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel "without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". Johnson went on to say that "by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Johnson recognised that in Bond there "was a social phenomenon of some importance", but this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned "three basic ingredients in "Dr No", all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult." Johnson saw no positives in "Dr. No", and said, "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner."

Lycett notes that Fleming "went into a personal and creative decline" after marital problems and the attacks on his work. <a href="Goldfinger%20%28novel%29">"Goldfinger"</a> had been written before the publication of "Dr. No"; the next book Fleming produced after the criticism was <a href="For%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">"For Your Eyes Only"</a>, a collection of short stories derived from outlines written for a television series that did not come to fruition. Lycett noted that, as Fleming was writing the television scripts and the short stories, "Ian's mood of weariness and self-doubt was beginning to affect his writing", which can be seen in Bond's thoughts.

In 1960 Fleming was commissioned by the <a href="Kuwait%20Oil%20Company">Kuwait Oil Company</a> to write a book on the country and its oil industry. The Kuwaiti Government disapproved of the typescript, "State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait", and it was never published. According to Fleming: "The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval. The <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a>s concerned found unpalatable certain mild comments and criticisms and particularly the passages referring to the adventurous past of the country which now wishes to be 'civilised' in every respect and forget its romantic origins."

Fleming followed the disappointment of "For Your Eyes Only" with <a href="Thunderball%20%28novel%29">"Thunderball"</a>, the <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of a film script on which he had worked with others. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, <a href="Kevin%20McClory">Kevin McClory</a>, and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script. In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter <a href="Jack%20Whittingham">Jack Whittingham</a> to the newly formed team, and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script. Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to <a href="Music%20Corporation%20of%20America">MCA</a>, with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer. He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, back out of the deal, or file a suit in court.

Working at Goldeneye between January and March 1960, Fleming wrote the novel "Thunderball", based on the screenplay written by himself, Whittingham and McClory. In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy, and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> in London for an injunction to stop publication. After <a href="Thunderball%20%28novel%29%23Controversy">two court actions</a>, the second in November 1961, Fleming offered McClory a deal, settling out of court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given the rights to the novel, provided it was acknowledged as "based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author".

Fleming's books had always sold well, but in 1961 sales increased dramatically. On 17 March 1961, four years after its publication and three years after the heavy criticism of "Dr. No", an article in "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" listed "From Russia, with Love" as one of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">US President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s ten favourite books. Kennedy and Fleming had previously met in Washington. This accolade and the associated publicity led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. Fleming considered "From Russia, with Love" to be his best novel; he said "the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned."

In April 1961, shortly before the second court case on "Thunderball", Fleming had a heart attack during a regular weekly meeting at "The Sunday Times". While he was convalescing, one of his friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of <a href="Beatrix%20Potter">Beatrix Potter</a>'s "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Squirrel%20Nutkin">The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</a>" and suggested that he take the time to write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell to his son Caspar each evening. Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that "There is not a moment, even on the edge of the tomb, when I am not slaving for you"; the result was Fleming's only children's novel, "<a href="Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang">Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang</a>", which was published in October 1964, two months after his death.

In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to <a href="Harry%20Saltzman">Harry Saltzman</a>. Saltzman formed the production vehicle <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> along with <a href="Albert%20R.%20Broccoli">Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli</a>, and after an extensive search, they hired <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> on a five-film deal, beginning with "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">Dr. No</a>" (1962). Connery's depiction of Bond affected the literary character; in "<a href="You%20Only%20Live%20Twice%20%28novel%29">You Only Live Twice</a>", the first book written after "Dr. No" was released, Fleming gave Bond a sense of humour that was not present in the previous stories.

Fleming's second non-fiction book was published in November 1963: "<a href="Thrilling%20Cities">Thrilling Cities</a>", a reprint of a series of "Sunday Times" articles based on Fleming's impressions of world cities in trips taken during 1959 and 1960. Approached in 1964 by producer <a href="Norman%20Felton">Norman Felton</a> to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters <a href="Napoleon%20Solo">Napoleon Solo</a> and <a href="The%20Girl%20from%20U.N.C.L.E.">April Dancer</a>, for the series "<a href="The%20Man%20from%20U.N.C.L.E.">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a>" However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any legal problems that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.

In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye for what proved to be his last holiday and wrote the first draft of "The Man with the Golden Gun". He was dissatisfied with it and wrote to <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a>, the copy editor of his novels, asking for it to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.

Fleming was a heavy <a href="tobacco%20smoking">smoker</a> and <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">drinker</a> throughout his adult life, and suffered from <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>. In 1961, aged 53, he suffered a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> and struggled to <a href="recuperation%20%28recovery%29">recuperate</a>. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, Fleming went to the <a href="Royal%20St%20George%27s%20Golf%20Club">Royal St George's Golf Club</a> for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying "I am sorry to trouble you chaps. I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." Fleming was buried in the churchyard of <a href="Sevenhampton%2C%20Wiltshire">Sevenhampton</a>, near <a href="Swindon">Swindon</a>.

Fleming's last two books, "The Man with the Golden Gun" and "Octopussy and The Living Daylights", were published posthumously. "The Man with the Golden Gun" was published eight months after Fleming's death and had not been through the full editing process by Fleming. As a result, the novel was thought by publishing company Jonathan Cape to be thin and "feeble". The publishers had passed the manuscript to <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> to read on holiday, but did not use his suggestions. Fleming's biographer Henry Chandler observes that the novel "received polite and rather sad reviews, recognising that the book had effectively been left half-finished, and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game". The final Bond book, containing two short stories, "Octopussy and The Living Daylights", was published in Britain on 23 June 1966.

In October 1975, Fleming's son Caspar, aged 23, committed suicide by <a href="drug%20overdose">drug overdose</a> and was buried with his father. Fleming's widow, Ann, died in 1981 and was buried with her husband and their son.

The author <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>, who later wrote a series of Bond novels, noted that Fleming's books fall into two distinct periods along stylistic lines. Those books written between 1953 and 1960 tend to concentrate on "mood, character development, and plot advancement", while those released between 1961 and 1966 incorporate more detail and imagery. Benson argues that Fleming had become "a master storyteller" by the time he wrote "Thunderball" in 1961.

<a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> divides the series based on the villains Fleming created, a division supported by fellow academic Christoph Lindner. Thus the early books from "Casino Royale" to "For Your Eyes Only" are classed as "Cold War stories", with <a href="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> as the antagonists, followed by <a href="Ernst%20Stavro%20Blofeld">Blofeld</a> and <a href="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> as Bond's opponents in the three novels "Thunderball", "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and "You Only Live Twice", after the thawing of East–West relations. Black and Lindner both classify the remaining books—"The Man with the Golden Gun", "Octopussy and The Living Daylights" and "The Spy Who Loved Me"—as "the later Fleming stories".

Fleming said of his work, "while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He named <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>, <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>, <a href="Eric%20Ambler">Eric Ambler</a> and <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> as influences. William Cook in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" considered James Bond to be "the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">Bulldog Drummond</a> tales of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="H.%20C.%20McNeile">H. C. McNeile</a> (aka "Sapper") and the <a href="Richard%20Hannay">Richard Hannay</a> stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain ... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age." <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> considered <a href="Mickey%20Spillane">Mickey Spillane</a> to have been another major influence.

In May 1963 Fleming wrote a piece for "Books and Bookmen" magazine in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." Benson identified what he described as the "Fleming Sweep", the use of "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> calls "a heightened journalistic style" to produce "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".

Umberto Eco analysed Fleming's works from a <a href="Structuralism">Structuralist</a> point of view, and identified a series of oppositions within the storylines that provide structure and narrative, including:

Eco also noted that the Bond villains tend to come from Central Europe or from Slavic or Mediterranean countries and have a mixed heritage and "complex and obscure origins". Eco found that the villains were generally asexual or homosexual, inventive, organisationally astute, and wealthy. Black observed the same point: "Fleming did not use class enemies for his villains instead relying on physical distortion or ethnic identity ... Furthermore, in Britain foreign villains used foreign servants and employees ... This racism reflected not only a pronounced theme of interwar adventure writing, such as the novels of Buchan, but also wider literary culture." Writer <a href="Louise%20Welsh">Louise Welsh</a> found that the novel "Live and Let Die" "taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" as the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>s challenged prejudice and inequality.

Fleming used well-known brand names and everyday details to support a sense of realism. Kingsley Amis called this "the Fleming effect", describing it as "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced."

The Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power. As the series progressed, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in "From Russia, with Love", it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, "we don't show teeth any more—only gums." The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel "You Only Live Twice", in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, <a href="Tiger%20Tanaka">Tiger Tanaka</a>. Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation</a>, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire "with both hands".

Black points to the defections of <a href="Cambridge%20Five">four members of MI6</a> to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> as having a major impact on how Britain was viewed in US intelligence circles. The last of the defections was that of <a href="Kim%20Philby">Kim Philby</a> in January 1963, while Fleming was still writing the first draft of "You Only Live Twice". The briefing between Bond and M is the first time in the twelve books that Fleming acknowledges the defections. Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the <a href="Profumo%20Affair">Profumo Affair</a> of 1963 as a backdrop. Two of the defections had taken place shortly before Fleming wrote "Casino Royale", and the book can be seen as the writer's "attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like <a href="Guy%20Burgess">Burgess</a> and <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Maclean</a>", according to Lycett.

By the end of the series, in the 1965 novel, "The Man with the Golden Gun", Black notes that an independent inquiry was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary, while the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting "under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID": this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, further underlining the decline of the British Empire. The decline was also reflected in Bond's use of US equipment and personnel in several novels. Uncertain and shifting geopolitics led Fleming to replace the Russian organisation SMERSH with the international terrorist group SPECTRE in "Thunderball", permitting "evil unconstrained by ideology". Black argues that SPECTRE provides a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series.

A theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War. "The Times" journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was "the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power", at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed. Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters: in <a href="For%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%28short%20story%29">"For Your Eyes Only"</a>, the villain, Hammerstein, is a former <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> officer, while the sympathetic <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">Montgomery</a> in the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a>. Similarly, in "Moonraker", Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a "megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman", and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff. In this, Fleming "exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press." As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly.

Periodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission. Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies "add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels". In "Live and Let Die", agents Quarrel and <a href="Felix%20Leiter">Leiter</a> represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that "the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job". In "Dr. No", Quarrel is "an indispensable ally". Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death.

From the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong. Bond's target in "Casino Royale", <a href="Le%20Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a>, was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament, especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951. The "traitor within" theme continued in "Live and Let Die" and "Moonraker".

Raymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil. This crystallised in "Goldfinger" with the <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something"; Black notes that the image of St. George is an English, rather than British personification.

The Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> observed that "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in "<a href="The%20James%20Bond%20Dossier">The James Bond Dossier</a>", pointed out that "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he".

For three of the novels, "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "Dr. No", it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem, and Black points out that although it is American assets that are under threat in "Dr. No", a British agent and a British warship, HMS "Narvik", are sent with British soldiers to the island at the end of the novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel "You Only Live Twice" reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.

In the late 1950s the author <a href="Geoffrey%20Jenkins">Geoffrey Jenkins</a> had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential. After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Glidrose Productions</a> to write a <a href="continuation%20novel">continuation</a> Bond novel, "<a href="Per%20Fine%20Ounce">Per Fine Ounce</a>", but it was never published. Starting with Kingsley Amis's "<a href="Colonel%20Sun">Colonel Sun</a>", under the pseudonym "<a href="Robert%20Markham">Robert Markham</a>" in 1968, several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including <a href="Sebastian%20Faulks">Sebastian Faulks</a>, who was asked by <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a> to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008.

During his lifetime Fleming sold thirty million books; double that number were sold in the two years following his death. In 2008 "The Times" ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". In 2002 Ian Fleming Publications announced the launch of the <a href="CWA%20Ian%20Fleming%20Steel%20Dagger">CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger</a> award, presented by the <a href="Crime%20Writers%27%20Association">Crime Writers' Association</a> to the best thriller, adventure or spy novel originally published in the UK.

The Eon Productions series of Bond films, which started in 1962 with "Dr. No", continued after Fleming's death. Along with two non-Eon produced films, there have been twenty four Eon films, with the most recent, "<a href="Spectre%20%282015%20film%29">Spectre</a>", released in October 2015. The Eon Productions series has grossed over $6.2 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing film series.

The influence of Bond in the cinema and in literature is evident in films and books including <a href="Austin%20Powers%20%28film%20series%29">"Austin Powers" series</a>, "<a href="Carry%20On%20Spying">Carry On Spying</a>" and the <a href="Jason%20Bourne">Jason Bourne</a> character. In 2011 Fleming became the first English-language writer to have an international airport named after him: <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20International%20Airport">Ian Fleming International Airport</a>, near <a href="Oracabessa">Oracabessa</a>, Jamaica, was officially opened on 12 January 2011 by Jamaican Prime Minister <a href="Bruce%20Golding">Bruce Golding</a> and Fleming's niece, Lucy.

Æthelstan

Æthelstan or Athelstan (; or "Æðelstān"; meaning "noble stone"; 894 – 27 October 939) was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">King of the Anglo-Saxons</a> from 924 to 927 and <a href="List%20of%20English%20monarchs">King of the English</a> from 927 to 939 when he died. He was the son of King <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a> and his first wife, <a href="Ecgwynn">Ecgwynn</a>. Modern historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. He never married and had no children. He was succeeded by his half-brother, <a href="Edmund%20I">Edmund</a>.

When Edward died in July 924, Æthelstan was accepted by the <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>ns as king. His half-brother <a href="%C3%86lfweard%20of%20Wessex">Ælfweard</a> may have been recognised as king in <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, but died within three weeks of their father's death. Æthelstan encountered resistance in Wessex for several months, and was not crowned until September 925. In 927 he conquered the last remaining <a href="Viking">Viking</a> kingdom, <a href="Scandinavian%20York">York</a>, making him the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England. In 934 he invaded Scotland and forced <a href="Constantine%20II%20of%20Scotland">Constantine II</a> to submit to him, but Æthelstan's rule was resented by the Scots and Vikings, and in 937 they invaded England. Æthelstan defeated them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a>, a victory which gave him great prestige both in the British Isles and on the Continent. After his death in 939 the Vikings seized back control of York, and it was not finally reconquered until 954.

Æthelstan centralised government; he increased control over the production of <a href="charter">charter</a>s and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils. These meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory, especially Welsh kings, who thus acknowledged his overlordship. More legal texts survive from his reign than from any other 10th-century English king. They show his concern about widespread robberies, and the threat they posed to social order. His legal reforms built on those of his grandfather, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. Æthelstan was one of the most pious West Saxon kings, and was known for collecting relics and founding churches. His household was the centre of English learning during his reign, and it laid the foundation for the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monastic reform later in the century. No other West Saxon king played as important a role in European politics as Æthelstan, and he arranged the marriages of several of his sisters to continental rulers.

By the ninth century the many kingdoms of the early Anglo-Saxon period had been consolidated into four: Wessex, Mercia, <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. In the eighth century, Mercia had been the most powerful kingdom in southern England, but in the early ninth, Wessex became dominant under Æthelstan's great-great-grandfather, <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a>. In the middle of the century, England came under increasing attack from <a href="Viking">Viking</a> raids, culminating in invasion by the <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a> in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex. The West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great, and achieved a decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a>. Alfred and the Viking leader <a href="Guthrum">Guthrum</a> agreed on a division that gave Alfred western Mercia, while eastern Mercia was incorporated into Viking East Anglia. In the 890s, renewed Viking attacks were successfully fought off by Alfred, assisted by his son (and Æthelstan's father) Edward and <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Mercians">Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians</a>. Æthelred ruled English Mercia under Alfred and was married to his daughter <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a>. Alfred died in 899 and was succeeded by Edward. <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwold</a>, the son of <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a>, King Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, made a bid for power, but was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Holme">Battle of the Holme</a> in 902.

Little is known of warfare between the English and the Danes over the next few years, but in 909, Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian army to ravage Northumbria. The following year the Northumbrian Danes attacked Mercia, but suffered a decisive defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tettenhall">Battle of Tettenhall</a>. Æthelred died in 911 and was succeeded as ruler of Mercia by his widow Æthelflæd. Over the next decade, Edward and Æthelflæd conquered Viking Mercia and East Anglia. Æthelflæd died in 918 and was briefly succeeded by her daughter <a href="%C3%86lfwynn">Ælfwynn</a>, but in the same year Edward deposed her and took direct control of Mercia.

When Edward died in 924, he controlled all of England south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. The Viking king <a href="Sitric%20C%C3%A1ech">Sihtric</a> ruled the <a href="Scandinavian%20York">Kingdom of York</a> in southern Northumbria, but <a href="Ealdred%20I%20of%20Bamburgh">Ealdred</a> maintained Anglo-Saxon rule in at least part of the former kingdom of <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a> from his base in <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a> in northern Northumbria. <a href="Constantine%20II%20of%20Scotland">Constantine II</a> ruled Scotland, apart from the southwest, which was the British <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>. Wales was divided into a number of small kingdoms, including <a href="Deheubarth">Deheubarth</a> in the southwest, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwent">Gwent</a> in the southeast, <a href="Brycheiniog">Brycheiniog</a> immediately north of Gwent, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a> in the north.

According to <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, Æthelstan was thirty years old when he came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born around 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, <a href="Ecgwynn">Ecgwynn</a>. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-<a href="Norman%20Conquest">Conquest</a> source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying descriptions of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Foot">Sarah Foot</a> argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to <a href="Dunstan">St Dunstan</a>.

William of Malmesbury wrote that Alfred the Great honoured his young grandson with a ceremony in which he gave him a scarlet cloak, a belt set with gems, and a sword with a gilded scabbard. Medieval Latin scholar <a href="Michael%20Lapidge">Michael Lapidge</a> and historian <a href="Michael%20Wood%20%28historian%29">Michael Wood</a> see this as designating Æthelstan as a potential heir at a time when the claim of Alfred's nephew, Æthelwold, to the throne represented a threat to the succession of Alfred's direct line, but historian <a href="Janet%20Nelson">Janet Nelson</a> suggests that it should be seen in the context of conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s, and might reflect an intention to divide the realm between his son and his grandson after his death. Historian Martin Ryan goes further, suggesting that at the end of his life Alfred may have favoured Æthelstan rather than Edward as his successor. An <a href="acrostic">acrostic</a> poem praising prince "Adalstan", and prophesying a great future for him, has been interpreted by Lapidge as referring to the young Æthelstan, punning on the old English meaning of his name, "noble stone". Lapidge and Wood see the poem as a commemoration of Alfred's ceremony by one of his leading scholars, <a href="John%20the%20Old%20Saxon">John the Old Saxon</a>. In Michael Wood's view, the poem confirms the truth of William of Malmesbury's account of the ceremony. Wood also suggests that Æthelstan may have been the first English king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual, and that John was probably his tutor. However, Sarah Foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better sense if it is dated to the beginning of Æthelstan's reign.

Edward married his second wife, <a href="%C3%86lffl%C3%A6d%2C%20wife%20of%20Edward%20the%20Elder">Ælfflæd</a>, at about the time of his father's death, probably because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and <a href="Edwin%2C%20son%20of%20Edward%20the%20Elder">Edwin</a>. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, <a href="Eadgifu%20of%20Kent">Eadgifu</a>, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and <a href="Eadred">Eadred</a>. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.

Æthelstan's later education was probably at the Mercian court of his aunt and uncle, Æthelflæd and Æthelred, and it is likely the young prince gained his military training in the Mercian campaigns to conquer the <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>. According to a transcript dating from 1304, in 925 Æthelstan gave a charter of privileges to <a href="St%20Oswald%27s%20Priory%2C%20Gloucester">St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester</a>, where his aunt and uncle were buried, "according to a pact of paternal piety which he formerly pledged with Æthelred, ealdorman of the people of the Mercians". When Edward took direct control of Mercia after Æthelflæd's death in 918, Æthelstan may have represented his father's interests there.

Edward died at <a href="Farndon%2C%20Cheshire">Farndon</a> in northern Mercia on 17 July 924, and the ensuing events are unclear. Ælfweard, Edward's eldest son by Ælfflæd, had ranked above Æthelstan in attesting a charter in 901, and Edward may have intended Ælfweard to be his successor as king, either of Wessex only or of the whole kingdom. If Edward had intended his realms to be divided after his death, his deposition of Ælfwynn in Mercia in 918 may have been intended to prepare the way for Æthelstan's succession as king of Mercia. When Edward died, Æthelstan was apparently with him in Mercia, while Ælfweard was in Wessex. Mercia acknowledged Æthelstan as king, and Wessex may have chosen Ælfweard. However, Ælfweard outlived his father by only sixteen days, disrupting any succession plan.

Even after Ælfweard's death there seems to have been opposition to Æthelstan in Wessex, particularly in Winchester, where Ælfweard was buried. At first Æthelstan behaved as a Mercian king. A charter relating to land in Derbyshire, which appears to have been issued at a time in 925 when his authority had not yet been recognised outside Mercia, was witnessed only by Mercian bishops. In the view of historians <a href="David%20Dumville">David Dumville</a> and Janet Nelson he may have agreed not to marry or have heirs in order to gain acceptance. However, Sarah Foot ascribes his decision to remain unmarried to "a religiously motivated determination on chastity as a way of life".

The coronation of Æthelstan took place on 4 September 925 at <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston upon Thames</a>, perhaps due to its symbolic location on the border between Wessex and Mercia. He was crowned by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Athelm">Athelm</a>, who probably designed or organised a new "ordo" (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet. The new "ordo" was influenced by <a href="West%20Francia">West Frankish</a> liturgy and in turn became one of the sources of the medieval French "ordo".

Opposition seems to have continued even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan on account of his supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was acting on behalf of Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, <a href="Frithestan">Frithestan</a>, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority.

In 933 Edwin was drowned in a shipwreck in the North Sea. His cousin, <a href="Adelolf%2C%20Count%20of%20Boulogne">Adelolf, Count of Boulogne</a>, took his body for burial at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Bertin">Abbey of Saint Bertin</a> in <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a>. According to the abbey's annalist, Folcuin, who wrongly believed that Edwin had been king, he had fled England "driven by some disturbance in his kingdom". Folcuin stated that Æthelstan sent alms to the abbey for his dead brother and received monks from the abbey graciously when they came to England, although Folcuin did not realise that Æthelstan died before the monks made the journey in 944. The twelfth-century chronicler <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a> said that Æthelstan ordered Edwin to be drowned, but this is generally dismissed by historians. Edwin might have fled England after an unsuccessful rebellion against his brother's rule, and his death probably helped put an end to Winchester's opposition.

Edward the Elder had conquered the Danish territories in Mercia and East Anglia with the assistance of Æthelflæd and her husband, but when Edward died the Danish king <a href="Sihtric%20C%C3%A1ech">Sihtric</a> still ruled the Viking Kingdom of York (formerly the southern Northumbrian kingdom of <a href="Deira">Deira</a>). In January 926, Æthelstan arranged for one of his sisters to marry Sihtric. The two kings agreed not to invade each other's territories or to support each other's enemies. The following year Sihtric died, and Æthelstan seized the chance to invade. <a href="Gofraid%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Guthfrith</a>, a cousin of Sihtric, led a fleet from <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> to try to take the throne, but Æthelstan easily prevailed. He captured York and received the submission of the Danish people. According to a southern chronicler, he "succeeded to the kingdom of the Northumbrians", and it is uncertain whether he had to fight Guthfrith. Southern kings had never ruled the north, and his usurpation was met with outrage by the Northumbrians, who had always resisted southern control. However, at <a href="Eamont%20Bridge">Eamont</a>, near <a href="Penrith%2C%20Cumbria">Penrith</a>, on 12 July 927, King Constantine of Scotland, King <a href="Hywel%20Dda">Hywel Dda</a> of Deheubarth, <a href="Ealdred%20I%20of%20Bamburgh">Ealdred of Bamburgh</a>, and <a href="Owen%20I%20of%20Strathclyde">King Owain of Strathclyde</a> (or Morgan ap Owain of Gwent) accepted Æthelstan's overlordship. His triumph led to seven years of peace in the north.

Whereas Æthelstan was the first English king to achieve lordship over northern Britain, he inherited his authority over the Welsh kings from his father and aunt. In the 910s Gwent acknowledged the lordship of Wessex, and Deheubarth and Gwynedd accepted that of Æthelflæd of Mercia; following Edward's takeover of Mercia, they transferred their allegiance to him. According to William of Malmesbury, after the meeting at Eamont Æthelstan summoned the Welsh kings to Hereford, where he imposed a heavy annual tribute and fixed the border between England and Wales in the Hereford area at the River Wye. The dominant figure in Wales was Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, described by the historian of early medieval Wales <a href="Thomas%20Charles-Edwards">Thomas Charles-Edwards</a> as "the firmest ally of the 'emperors of Britain' among all the kings of his day". Welsh kings attended Æthelstan's court between 928 and 935 and witnessed charters at the head of the list of laity (apart from the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde), showing that their position was regarded as superior to that of the other great men present. The alliance produced peace between Wales and England, and within Wales, lasting throughout Æthelstan's reign, though some Welsh resented the status of their rulers as under-kings, as well as the high level of tribute imposed upon them. In "<a href="Armes%20Prydein">Armes Prydein Vawr</a>" (The Great Prophecy of Britain), a Welsh poet foresaw the day when the British would rise up against their Saxon oppressors and drive them into the sea.

According to William of Malmesbury, after the Hereford meeting Æthelstan went on to expel the Cornish from <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, fortify its walls, and fix the Cornish boundary at the <a href="River%20Tamar">River Tamar</a>. This account is regarded sceptically by historians, however, as Cornwall had been under English rule since the mid-ninth century. Thomas Charles-Edwards describes it as "an improbable story", while historian John Reuben Davies sees it as the suppression of a British revolt and the confinement of the Cornish beyond the Tamar. Æthelstan emphasised his control by establishing a new <a href="Bishop%20of%20Cornwall">Cornish see</a> and appointing its <a href="Conan%20of%20Cornwall">first bishop</a>, but Cornwall kept its own culture and language.

Æthelstan became the first king of all the Anglo-Saxon peoples, and in effect overlord of Britain. His successes inaugurated what <a href="John%20Maddicott">John Maddicott</a>, in his history of the origins of the English Parliament, calls the "imperial phase" of English kingship between about 925 and 975, when rulers from Wales and Scotland attended the assemblies of English kings and witnessed their charters. Æthelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of Northumbria to his rule. He lavished gifts on the minsters of <a href="Beverley%20Minster">Beverley</a>, Chester-le-Street, and <a href="York%20Minster">York</a>, emphasising his Christianity. He also purchased the vast territory of <a href="Amounderness">Amounderness</a> in Lancashire, and gave it to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, his most important lieutenant in the region. But he remained a resented outsider, and the northern British kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan Norse of Dublin. In contrast to his strong control over southern Britain, his position in the north was far more tenuous.

In 934 Æthelstan invaded Scotland. His reasons are unclear, and historians give alternative explanations. The death of his half-brother Edwin in 933 might have finally removed factions in Wessex opposed to his rule. Guthfrith, the Norse king of Dublin who had briefly ruled Northumbria, died in 934; any resulting insecurity among the Danes would have given Æthelstan an opportunity to stamp his authority on the north. An entry in the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Clonmacnoise">Annals of Clonmacnoise</a>", recording the death in 934 of a ruler who was possibly Ealdred of Bamburgh, suggests another possible explanation. This points to a dispute between Æthelstan and Constantine over control of his territory. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" briefly recorded the expedition without explanation, but the twelfth-century chronicler <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> stated that Constantine had broken his treaty with Æthelstan.

Æthelstan set out on his campaign in May 934, accompanied by four Welsh kings: Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, <a href="Idwal%20Foel">Idwal Foel</a> of Gwynedd, Morgan ap Owain of Gwent, and Tewdwr ap Griffri of Brycheiniog. His retinue also included eighteen bishops and thirteen earls, six of whom were Danes from eastern England. By late June or early July he had reached <a href="Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a>, where he made generous gifts to the tomb of St Cuthbert, including a <a href="Stole%20%28vestment%29">stole</a> and <a href="Maniple%20%28vestment%29">maniple</a> (ecclesiastical garments) originally commissioned by his step-mother Ælfflæd as a gift to Bishop Frithestan of Winchester. The invasion was launched by land and sea. According to the twelfth-century chronicler <a href="Simeon%20of%20Durham">Simeon of Durham</a>, his land forces ravaged as far as <a href="Dunnottar%20Castle">Dunnottar</a> in north-east Scotland, while the fleet raided <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, then probably part of the Norse kingdom of Orkney.

No battles are recorded during the campaign, and chronicles do not record its outcome. By September, however, he was back in the south of England at <a href="Buckingham">Buckingham</a>, where Constantine witnessed a charter as "subregulus", that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine, Owain of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ap Owain. At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.

In 934 <a href="Olaf%20III%20Guthfrithson">Olaf Guthfrithson</a> succeeded his father Guthfrith as the Norse King of Dublin. The alliance between the Norse and the Scots was cemented by the marriage of Olaf to Constantine's daughter. By August 937 Olaf had defeated his rivals for control of the Viking part of Ireland, and he promptly launched a bid for the former Norse kingdom of York. Individually Olaf and Constantine were too weak to oppose Æthelstan, but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of Wessex. In the autumn they joined with the Strathclyde Britons under Owain to invade England. Medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer, and Æthelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year. He seems to have been slow to react, and an old Latin poem preserved by William of Malmesbury accused him of having "languished in sluggish leisure". The allies plundered English territory while Æthelstan took his time gathering a West Saxon and Mercian army. However, historian <a href="Michael%20Wood%20%28historian%29">Michael Wood</a> praises his caution, arguing that unlike <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold</a> in 1066, he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action. When he marched north, the Welsh did not join him, and they did not fight on either side.

The two sides met at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a>, resulting in an overwhelming victory for Æthelstan, supported by his young half-brother, the future <a href="Edmund%20I%20of%20England">King Edmund I</a>. Olaf escaped back to Dublin with the remnant of his forces, while Constantine lost a son. The English also suffered heavy losses, including two of Æthelstan's cousins, sons of Edward the Elder's younger brother, <a href="%C3%86thelweard%20%28son%20of%20Alfred%29">Æthelweard</a>.

The battle was reported in the <a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>:

A generation later, the chronicler <a href="%C3%86thelweard%20%28historian%29">Æthelweard</a> reported that it was popularly remembered as "the great battle", and it sealed Æthelstan's posthumous reputation as "victorious because of God" (in the words of the homilist <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Eynsham">Ælfric of Eynsham</a>). The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" abandoned its usual terse style in favour of a <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh%20%28poem%29">heroic poem vaunting the great victory</a>, employing imperial language to present Æthelstan as ruler of an empire of Britain. The site of the battle is uncertain, however, and over thirty sites have been suggested, with <a href="Bromborough">Bromborough</a> on the <a href="Wirral%20Peninsula">Wirral</a> the most favoured among historians.

Historians disagree over the significance of the battle. <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a> describes it as a "<a href="pyrrhic%20victory">pyrrhic victory</a>" for Æthelstan: the campaign seems to have ended in a stalemate, his power appears to have declined, and after he died Olaf acceded to the kingdom of Northumbria without resistance. <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Smyth">Alfred Smyth</a> describes it as "the greatest battle in Anglo-Saxon history", but he also states that its consequences beyond Æthelstan's reign have been overstated. In the view of Sarah Foot, on the other hand, it would be difficult to exaggerate the battle's importance: if the Anglo-Saxons had been defeated, their hegemony over the whole mainland of Britain would have disintegrated.

Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through <a href="ealdorman">ealdormen</a>, who had the highest lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but by the middle of the tenth they had authority over a much wider area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal with the problems of governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20Half-King">Æthelstan</a>, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.

Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal officials who were noble local landowners—were in charge of a town or royal estate. The authority of church and state was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.

As the first king of all the Anglo-Saxon peoples, Æthelstan needed effective means to govern his extended realm. Building on the foundations of his predecessors, he created the most centralised government that England had yet seen. Previously, some charters had been produced by royal priests and others by members of religious houses, but between 928 and 935 they were produced exclusively by a scribe known to historians as "<a href="%C3%86thelstan%20A">Æthelstan A</a>", showing an unprecedented degree of royal control over an important activity. Unlike earlier and later charters, "Æthelstan A" provides full details of the date and place of adoption and an unusually long witness list, providing crucial information for historians. After "Æthelstan A" retired or died, charters reverted to a simpler form, suggesting that they had been the work of an individual, rather than the development of a formal writing office.

A key mechanism of government was the Royal Council (or <a href="Witenagemot">witan</a>). Anglo-Saxon kings did not have a fixed capital city. Their courts were peripatetic, and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms. Æthelstan stayed mainly in Wessex, however, and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils. The small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under Edward the Elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops, ealdormen, thegns, magnates from distant areas, and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority. <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> sees Æthelstan's councils as "national assemblies", which did much to break down the provincialism that was a barrier to the unification of England. John Maddicott goes further, seeing them as the start of centralised assemblies that had a defined role in English government, and Æthelstan as "the true if unwitting founder of the English parliament".

The Anglo-Saxons were the first people in northern Europe to write administrative documents in the vernacular, and law codes in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> go back to <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a> at the beginning of the seventh century. The law code of Alfred the Great, from the end of the ninth century, was also written in the vernacular, and he expected his <a href="ealdormen">ealdormen</a> to learn it. His code was strongly influenced by <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> law going back to <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> in such areas as treason, peace-keeping, organisation of the <a href="Hundred%20%28county%20division%29">hundreds</a> and <a href="Trial%20by%20ordeal">judicial ordeal</a>. It remained in force throughout the tenth century, and Æthelstan's codes were built on this foundation. Legal codes required the approval of the king, but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at local level, rather than a fixed canon of regulations, and customary oral law was also important in the Anglo-Saxon period.

More legal texts survive from Æthelstan's reign than from any other tenth-century English king. The earliest appear to be his tithe edict and the "Ordinance on Charities". Four legal codes were adopted at Royal Councils in the early 930s at <a href="Grately">Grately</a> in Hampshire, Exeter, <a href="Faversham">Faversham</a> in Kent, and Thunderfield in Surrey. Local legal texts survive from London and Kent, and one concerning <a href="Archenfield">the 'Dunsæte'</a> on the Welsh border probably also dates to Æthelstan's reign. In the view of the historian of English law, <a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a>, the laws must have been written by <a href="Wulfhelm">Wulfhelm</a>, who succeeded Athelm as Archbishop of Canterbury in 926. Other historians see Wulfhelm's role as less important, giving the main credit to Æthelstan himself, although the significance placed on the ordeal as an ecclesiastical ritual shows the increased influence of the church. <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> sees the role of the bishops as marking an important stage in the increasing involvement of the church in the making and enforcement of law.

The two earliest codes were concerned with clerical matters, and Æthelstan stated that he acted on the advice of Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.

The later codes show his concern with threats to social order, especially robbery, which he regarded as the most important manifestation of social breakdown. The first of these later codes, issued at Grately, prescribed harsh penalties, including the death penalty for anyone over twelve years old caught in the act of stealing goods worth more than eight pence. This apparently had little effect, as Æthelstan admitted in the Exeter code:
In desperation the Council tried a different strategy, offering an amnesty to thieves if they paid compensation to their victims. The problem of powerful families protecting criminal relatives was to be solved by expelling them to other parts of the realm. This strategy did not last long, and at Thunderfield Æthelstan returned to the hard line, softened by raising the minimum age for the death penalty to fifteen "because he thought it too cruel to kill so many young people and for such small crimes as he understood to be the case everywhere". His reign saw the first introduction of the system of <a href="tithing">tithing</a>, sworn groups of ten or more men who were jointly responsible for peace-keeping (later known as <a href="frankpledge">frankpledge</a>). Sarah Foot commented that tithing and oath-taking to deal with the problem of theft had its origin in Frankia:

Historians differ widely regarding Æthelstan's legislation. Patrick Wormald's verdict was harsh: "The hallmark of Æthelstan's law-making is the gulf dividing its exalted aspirations from his spasmodic impact." In his view, "The legislative activity of Æthelstan's reign has rightly been dubbed 'feverish'... But the extant results are, frankly, a mess." In the view of Simon Keynes, however, "Without any doubt the most impressive aspect of King Æthelstan's government is the vitality of his law-making", which shows him driving his officials to do their duties and insisting on respect for the law, but also demonstrates the difficulty he had in controlling a troublesome people. Keynes sees the Grately code as "an impressive piece of legislation" showing the king's determination to maintain social order. David Pratt describes his legislation as "a deep and far-reaching reform of legal structures, no less important than developments under King Alfred two generations earlier".

In the 970s, Æthelstan's nephew, <a href="Edgar%20the%20Peaceful">King Edgar</a>, reformed the monetary system to give Anglo-Saxon England the most advanced currency in Europe, with a good quality silver coinage, which was uniform and abundant. In Æthelstan's time, however, it was far less developed, and <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">minting</a> was still organised regionally long after Æthelstan unified the country. The Grately code included a provision that there was to be only one <a href="History%20of%20the%20English%20penny%20%28c.%20600%20%E2%80%93%201066%29">coinage</a> across the king's dominion. However, this is in a section that appears to be copied from a code of his father, and the list of towns with mints is confined to the south, including London and Kent, but not northern Wessex or other regions. Early in Æthelstan's reign, different styles of coin were issued in each region, but after he conquered York and received the submission of the other British kings, he issued a new coinage, known as the "circumscription cross" type. This advertised his newly exalted status with the inscription, "Rex Totius Britanniae". Examples were minted in Wessex, York, and English Mercia (in Mercia bearing the title "Rex Saxorum"), but not in East Anglia or the Danelaw.

In the early 930s a new coinage was issued, the "crowned bust" type, with the king shown for the first time wearing a crown with three stalks. This was eventually issued in all regions apart from Mercia, which issued coins without a ruler portrait, suggesting, in Sarah Foot's view, that any Mercian affection for a West Saxon king brought up among them quickly declined.

Church and state maintained close relations in the Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically. Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the Royal Council. During Æthelstan's reign these relations became even closer, especially as the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and Æthelstan's conquests brought the northern church under the control of a southern king for the first time.

Æthelstan appointed members of his own circle to bishoprics in Wessex, possibly to counter the influence of the Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan. One of the king's mass-priests (priests employed to say Mass in his household), <a href="Alphege%20of%20Wells">Ælfheah</a>, became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Wells">Bishop of Wells</a>, while another, <a href="Beornstan%20of%20Winchester">Beornstan</a>, succeeded Frithestan as Bishop of Winchester. Beornstan was succeeded by another member of the royal household, also called <a href="%C3%86lfheah%20the%20Bald">Ælfheah</a>. Two of the leading figures in the later tenth-century Benedictine revival of Edgar's reign, Dunstan and <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold</a>, served in early life at Æthelstan's court and were ordained as priests by Ælfheah of Winchester at the king's request. According to Æthelwold's biographer, <a href="Wulfstan%20the%20Cantor">Wulfstan</a>, "Æthelwold spent a long period in the royal palace in the king's inseparable companionship and learned much from the king's wise men that was useful and profitable to him". <a href="Oda%20of%20Canterbury">Oda</a>, a future Archbishop of Canterbury, was also close to Æthelstan, who appointed him <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ramsbury%20%28ancient%29">Bishop of Ramsbury</a>. Oda may have been present at the battle of Brunanburh.

Æthelstan was a noted collector of relics, and while this was a common practice at the time, he was marked out by the scale of his collection and the refinement of its contents. The abbot of Saint Samson in <a href="Ancient%20Diocese%20of%20Dol">Dol</a> sent him some as a gift, and in his covering letter he wrote: "we know you value relics more than earthly treasure". Æthelstan was also a generous donor of manuscripts and relics to churches and monasteries. Indeed, his reputation was so great that some monastic scribes later falsely claimed that their institutions had been beneficiaries of his largesse. He was especially devoted to the cult of <a href="Cuthbert">St. Cuthbert</a> in Chester-le-Street, and his gifts to the community there included <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s Lives of Cuthbert. He commissioned it especially to present to Chester-le Street, and out of all manuscripts he gave to a religious foundation which survive, it is the only one which was wholly written in England during his reign. This has a portrait of Æthelstan presenting the book to Cuthbert, the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of an English king. In the view of Janet Nelson, his "rituals of largesse and devotion at sites of supernatural power ... enhanced royal authority and underpinned a newly united imperial realm".

Æthelstan had a reputation for founding churches, although it is unclear how justified this is. According to late and dubious sources, these churches included minsters at <a href="Milton%20Abbas">Milton Abbas</a> in Dorset and <a href="Muchelney%20Abbey">Muchelney</a> in Somerset. In the view of historian John Blair, the reputation is probably well-founded, but "These waters are muddied by Æthelstan's almost folkloric reputation as a founder, which made him a favourite hero of later origin-myths." However, while he was a generous donor to monasteries, he did not give land for new ones or attempt to revive the ones in the north and east destroyed by Viking attacks.

He also sought to build ties with continental churches. <a href="Koenwald">Cenwald</a> was a royal priest before his appointment as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, and in 929 he accompanied two of Æthelstan's half-sisters to the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Saxony">Saxon court</a> so that the future <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto</a>, could choose one of them as his wife. Cenwald went on to make a tour of German monasteries, giving lavish gifts on Æthelstan's behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him in perpetuity. England and Saxony became closer after the marriage alliance, and German names start to appear in English documents, while Cenwald kept up the contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence, helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to England.

Æthelstan built on his grandfather's efforts to revive ecclesiastical scholarship, which had fallen to a low state in the second half of the ninth century. John Blair described Æthelstan's achievement as "a determined reconstruction, visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books, of the shattered ecclesiastical culture". He was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning. His interest in education, and his reputation as a collector of books and relics, attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court, particularly Bretons and Irish. Æthelstan gave extensive aid to Breton clergy who had fled Brittany following its conquest by the Vikings in 919. He made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of <a href="Dol%20Cathedral">Dol Cathedral</a> in Brittany, who were then in exile in central France, and they sent him the relics of Breton saints, apparently hoping for his patronage. The contacts resulted in a surge in interest in England for commemorating Breton saints. One of the most notable scholars at Æthelstan's court was <a href="Israel%20the%20Grammarian">Israel the Grammarian</a>, who may have been a Breton. Israel and "a certain Frank" drew a board game called "<a href="Alea%20evangelii">Gospel Dice</a>" for an Irish bishop, Dub Innse, who took it home to <a href="Bangor%2C%20County%20Down">Bangor</a>. Æthelstan's court played a crucial role in the origins of the English monastic reform movement.

Few prose narrative sources survive from Æthelstan's reign, but it produced an abundance of poetry, much of it Norse-influenced praise of the King in grandiose terms, such as the Brunanburh poem. Sarah Foot even made a case that <a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a> may have been composed in Æthelstan's circle.

Æthelstan's court was the centre of a revival of the elaborate "hermeneutic" style of later Latin writers, influenced by the West Saxon scholar <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a> (c.639–709), and by early tenth-century French monasticism. Foreign scholars at Æthelstan's court such as Israel the Grammarian were practitioners. The style was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. The "Æthelstan A" charters were written in "hermeneutic" Latin. In the view of Simon Keynes it is no coincidence that they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united England under his rule, and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the trappings of a new political order. The style influenced architects of the late tenth-century monastic reformers educated at Æthelstan's court such as Æthelwold and Dunstan, and became a hallmark of the movement. After "Æthelstan A", charters became more simple, but the "hermeneutic" style returned in the charters of Eadwig and Edgar.

The historian <a href="W.%20H.%20Stevenson">W. H. Stevenson</a> commented in 1898:
However, Michael Lapidge argues that however unpalatable the "hermeneutic" style seems to modern taste, it was an important part of late Anglo-Saxon culture, and deserves more sympathetic attention than it has received from modern historians. In the view of historian David Woodman, "Æthelstan A" should "be accorded recognition as an individual author of no little genius, a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex ... In many ways the diplomas of "Æthelstan A" represent the stylistic peak of the Anglo-Saxon diplomatic tradition, a fitting complement to Æthelstan's own momentous political feats and to the forging of what would become England."

Historians frequently comment on Æthelstan's grand and extravagant titles. On his coins and charters he is described as "Rex totius Britanniae", or "King of the whole of Britain". A gospel book he donated to <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Canterbury">Christ Church, Canterbury</a> is inscribed "Æthelstan, king of the English and ruler of the whole of Britain with a devout mind gave this book to the primatial see of Canterbury, to the church dedicated to Christ". In charters from 931 he is "king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain", and in one manuscript dedication he is even styled "<a href="basileus">basileus</a> et curagulus", the titles of <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine emperors</a>. Some historians are not impressed. "Clearly", comments Alex Woolf, "King Æthelstan was a man who had pretensions," while in the view of Simon Keynes, "Æthelstan A" proclaimed his master king of Britain "by wishful extension". But according to George Molyneaux "this is to apply an anachronistic standard: tenth-century kings had a loose but real hegemony throughout the island, and their titles only appear inflated if one assumes that kingship ought to involve domination of an intensity like that seen within the English kingdom of the eleventh and later centuries."

Foreign contemporaries described him in panegyrical terms. The French chronicler <a href="Flodoard">Flodoard</a> described him as "the king from overseas", and the "Annals of Ulster" as the "pillar of the dignity of the western world". Some historians take a similar view. Michael Wood titled an essay, "The Making of King Aethelstan's Empire: an English Charlemagne?", and described him as "the most powerful ruler that Britain had seen since the Romans". In the view of Veronica Ortenberg, he was "the most powerful ruler in Europe" with an army that had repeatedly defeated the Vikings; continental rulers saw him as a Carolingian emperor, who "was clearly treated as the new Charlemagne". She wrote:

The West Saxon court had connections with the <a href="Carolingians">Carolingians</a> going back to the marriage between Æthelstan's great-grandfather <a href="%C3%86thelwulf%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwulf</a> and <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>, daughter of the king of West Francia (and future Holy Roman Emperor), <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, as well as the marriage of Alfred the Great's daughter, <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20Countess%20of%20Flanders">Ælfthryth</a> to Judith's son by a later marriage, <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin II, Count of Flanders</a>. One of Æthelstan's half-sisters, <a href="Eadgifu%20of%20Wessex">Eadgifu</a>, married <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a>, king of the <a href="West%20Franks">West Franks</a>, in the late 910s. He was deposed in 922, and Eadgifu sent their son, <a href="Louis%20IV%20of%20France">Louis</a> to safety in England. By Æthelstan's time the connection was well established, and his coronation was performed with the Carolingian ceremony of anointment, probably to draw a deliberate parallel between his rule and Carolingian tradition. His "crowned bust" coinage of 933–938 was the first Anglo-Saxon coinage to show the king crowned, following Carolingian iconography.

Like his father, Æthelstan was unwilling to marry his female relatives to his own subjects, so his sisters either entered nunneries or married foreign husbands. This was one reason for his close relations with European courts, and he married several of his half-sisters to European nobles in what historian Sheila Sharp called "a flurry of dynastic bridal activity unequalled again until Queen Victoria's time". Another reason lay in the common interest on both sides of the Channel in resisting the threat from the Vikings, while the rise in the power and reputation of the royal house of Wessex made marriage with an English princess more prestigious to European rulers. In 926 <a href="Hugh%20the%20Great">Hugh</a>, Duke of the Franks, sent Æthelstan's cousin, Adelolf, Count of Boulogne, on an embassy to ask for the hand of one of Æthelstan's sisters. According to William of Malmesbury, the gifts Adelolf brought included spices, jewels, many swift horses, a crown of solid gold, the sword of <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, Charlemagne's lance, and a piece of the <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns">Crown of Thorns</a>. Æthelstan sent his half-sister <a href="Eadhild">Eadhild</a> to be Hugh's wife.

Æthelstan's most important European alliance was with the new <a href="Liudolfing">Liudolfing</a> dynasty in <a href="East%20Francia">East Francia</a>. The Carolingian dynasty of East Francia had died out in the early tenth century, and its new Liudolfing king, <a href="Henry%20the%20Fowler">Henry the Fowler</a>, was seen by many as an "arriviste". He needed a royal marriage for his son to establish his legitimacy, but no suitable Carolingian princesses were available. The ancient royal line of the West Saxons provided an acceptable alternative, especially as they (wrongly) claimed descent from the seventh-century king and saint, <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>, who was venerated in Germany. In 929 or 930 Henry sent ambassadors to Æthelstan's court seeking a wife for his son, Otto, who later became Holy Roman Emperor. Æthelstan sent two of his half-sisters, and Otto chose <a href="Eadgyth">Eadgyth</a>. Fifty years later, Æthelweard, a descendant of Alfred the Great's older brother, addressed his Latin version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" to <a href="Mathilde%2C%20Abbess%20of%20Essen">Mathilde, Abbess of Essen</a>, who was Eadgyth's granddaughter, and had apparently requested it. The other sister, whose name is uncertain, was married to a prince from near the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> who has not definitely been identified.

In early medieval Europe, it was common for kings to act as foster-fathers for the sons of other kings. Æthelstan was known for the support he gave to dispossessed young royalty. In 936 he sent an English fleet to help his foster-son, <a href="Alan%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Alan II, Duke of Brittany</a>, to regain his ancestral lands, which had been conquered by the Vikings. In the same year he assisted the son of his half-sister Eadgifu, Louis, to take the throne of West Francia, and in 939 he sent another fleet that unsuccessfully attempted to help Louis in a struggle with rebellious magnates. According to later Scandinavian sources, he helped another possible foster-son, <a href="Haakon%20the%20Good">Hakon</a>, son of <a href="Harald%20Fairhair">Harald Fairhair</a>, king of <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, to reclaim his throne, and he was known among Norwegians as "Æthelstan the Good".

Æthelstan's court was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of the Anglo-Saxon period. The close contacts between the English and European courts ended soon after his death, but descent from the English royal house long remained a source of prestige for continental ruling families. According to Frank Stenton in his history of the period, "Anglo-Saxon England", "Between Offa and <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> there is no English king who played so prominent or so sustained a part in the general affairs of Europe."

Æthelstan died at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> on 27 October 939. His grandfather Alfred, his father Edward, and his half-brother Ælfweard had been buried at Winchester, but Æthelstan chose not to honour the city associated with opposition to his rule. By his own wish he was buried at <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a>, where he had buried his cousins who died at Brunanburh. No other member of the West Saxon royal family was buried there, and according to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan's choice reflected his devotion to the abbey and to the memory of its seventh-century abbot, Saint Aldhelm. William described Æthelstan as fair-haired "as I have seen for myself in his remains, beautifully intertwined with gold threads". His bones were lost during the <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, but he is commemorated by an empty fifteenth-century tomb.

After Æthelstan's death, the men of York immediately chose the Viking king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson (or his cousin, <a href="Anlaf%20Cuaran">Anlaf Cuaran</a>), as their king, and Anglo-Saxon control of the north, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed. The reigns of Æthelstan's half-brothers <a href="Edmund%20I%20of%20England">Edmund</a> (939–946) and Eadred (946–955) were largely devoted to regaining control. Olaf seized the east midlands, leading to the establishment of a frontier at <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>. In 941 Olaf died, and Edmund took back control of the east midlands, and then York in 944. Following Edmund's death York again switched back to Viking control, and it was only when the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king <a href="Eric%20Bloodaxe">Eric Bloodaxe</a> in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo-Saxon control of the whole of England was finally restored.

<a href="Chronicle">Chronicle</a> sources for the life of Æthelstan are limited, and the first biography, by Sarah Foot, was only published in 2011. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" in Æthelstan's reign is principally devoted to military events, and it is largely silent apart from recording his most important victories. An important source is the twelfth-century chronicle of William of Malmesbury, but historians are cautious about accepting his testimony, much of which cannot be verified from other sources. David Dumville goes so far as to dismiss William's account entirely, regarding him as a "treacherous witness" whose account is unfortunately influential. However, Sarah Foot is inclined to accept Michael Wood's argument that William's chronicle draws on a lost life of Æthelstan. She cautions, however, that we have no means of discovering how far William "improved" on the original.

In Dumville's view, Æthelstan has been regarded by historians as a shadowy figure because of an ostensible lack of source material, but he argues that the lack is more apparent than real. Charters, law codes, and coins throw considerable light on Æthelstan's government. The scribe known to historians as "Æthelstan A", who was responsible for drafting all charters between 928 and 935, provides very detailed information, including signatories, dates, and locations, illuminating Æthelstan's progress around his realm. "Æthelstan A" may have been Bishop <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Lichfield">Ælfwine of Lichfield</a>, who was close to the king. By contrast with this extensive source of information, no charters survive from 910 to 924, a gap which historians struggle to explain, and which makes it difficult to assess the degree of continuity in personnel and the operation of government between the reigns of Edward and Æthelstan. Historians are also paying increasing attention to less conventional sources, such as contemporary poetry in his praise and manuscripts associated with his name.

The reign of Æthelstan has been overshadowed by the achievements of his grandfather, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, but he is now considered one of the greatest kings of the West Saxon dynasty. Modern historians endorse the view of twelfth century chronicler William of Malmesbury that "no one more just or more learned ever governed the kingdom". Frank Stenton and Simon Keynes both describe him as the one Anglo-Saxon king who will bear comparison with Alfred. In Keynes's view he "has long been regarded, with good reason, as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century ... he has also been hailed as the first king of England, as a statesman of international standing". David Dumville describes Æthelstan as "the father of mediaeval and modern England", while Michael Wood regards <a href="Offa%20of%20Mercia">Offa</a>, Alfred, and Æthelstan as the three greatest Anglo-Saxon kings, and Æthelstan as "one of the more important lay intellectuals in Anglo-Saxon history".

Æthelstan is regarded as the first King of England by some modern historians. Although it was Eadred who would achieve the final unification of England by the permanent conquest of Viking York, Æthelstan's campaigns made this success possible. His nephew Edgar called himself King of the English and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of Britain. Simon Keynes argued that "the consistent usages of Edgar's reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by Æthelstan in the 930s". Historian Charles Insley, however, sees Æthelstan's hegemony as fragile: "The level of overlordship wielded by Æthelstan during the 930s over the rest of Britain was perhaps not attained again by an English king until <a href="Edward%20I">Edward I</a>." George Molyneaux argues that:

Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan's law-making as his greatest achievement. His reign predates the sophisticated state of the later Anglo-Saxon period, but his creation of the most centralised government England had yet seen, with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws, laid the foundations on which his brothers and nephews would create one of the wealthiest and most advanced systems of government in Europe. Æthelstan's reign built upon his grandfather's ecclesiastical programme, consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century.

Æthelstan's reputation was at its height when he died. According to Sarah Foot, "He found acclaim in his own day not only as a successful military leader and effective monarch but also as a man of devotion, committed to the promotion of religion and the patronage of learning." Later in the century, Æthelweard praised him as a very mighty king worthy of honour, and <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a>, who named his eight sons after his predecessors, put Æthelstan first as the name of his eldest son. In his biography of Æthelred, Levi Roach commented:

Memory of Æthelstan then declined until it was revived by William of Malmesbury, who took a special interest in him as the one king who had chosen to be buried in his own house. William's account kept his memory alive, and he was praised by other medieval chroniclers. In the early sixteenth century <a href="William%20Tyndale">William Tyndale</a> justified his English translation of the Bible by stating that he had read that King Æthelstan had caused the Holy Scriptures to be translated into Anglo-Saxon.

From the sixteenth century onwards Alfred's reputation became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. <a href="Sharon%20Turner">Sharon Turner</a>'s "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Anglo-Saxons">History of the Anglo-Saxons</a>", first published between 1799 and 1805, played a crucial role in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his "<a href="A%20Child%27s%20History%20of%20England">Child's History of England</a>", and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.

According to Michael Wood: "Among all the great rulers of British history, Æthelstan today is the forgotten man", and in medieval historian <a href="Ann%20Williams%20%28historian%29">Ann Williams</a>'s view: "If Æthelstan has not had the reputation which accrued to his grandfather, the fault lies in the surviving sources; Æthelstan had no biographer, and the "Chronicle" for his reign is scanty. In his own day he was 'the roof-tree of the honour of the western world'".

River Parrett

The River Parrett flows through the counties of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> and <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a>, from its <a href="River%20source">source</a> in the Thorney Mills <a href="Spring%20%28hydrology%29">springs</a> in the hills around <a href="Chedington">Chedington</a> in Dorset. Flowing northwest through Somerset and the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a> to its mouth at <a href="Burnham-on-Sea">Burnham-on-Sea</a>, into the <a href="Bridgwater%20Bay">Bridgwater Bay</a> <a href="National%20nature%20reserves%20in%20England">nature reserve</a> on the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a>, the Parrett and its tributaries drain an area of  – about 50 per cent of Somerset's land area, with a population of 300,000.

The Parrett's main tributaries include the Rivers <a href="River%20Tone">Tone</a>, <a href="River%20Isle">Isle</a>, and <a href="River%20Yeo%20%28South%20Somerset%29">Yeo</a>, and the <a href="River%20Cary%20%28Somerset%29">River Cary</a> via the <a href="King%27s%20Sedgemoor%20Drain">King's Sedgemoor Drain</a>. The long river is tidal for up to <a href="Oath%2C%20Somerset">Oath</a>. The fall of the river between <a href="Langport">Langport</a> and <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a> is only , so it is prone to frequent flooding in winter and during high tides. Many approaches have been tried since at least the medieval period to reduce the incidence and effect of floods and to drain the surrounding fields.

In <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> times the river formed a boundary between <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and <a href="Dumnonia">Dumnonia</a>. It later served the <a href="Bridgwater%23Port%20of%20Bridgwater">Port of Bridgwater</a>, and enabled cargoes to be transported inland. The arrival of the railways led to a decline in commercial shipping, and the only working docks are at <a href="Dunball">Dunball</a>. Man's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The <a href="River%20Parrett%20Trail">River Parrett Trail</a> has been established along the banks of the river.

The River Parrett is long, flowing roughly south to north from <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> through Somerset. Its <a href="River%20source">source</a> is in the Thorney Mills <a href="Spring%20%28hydrology%29">springs</a> in the hills around <a href="Chedington">Chedington</a>, from that of the <a href="River%20Axe%20%28Lyme%20Bay%29">River Axe</a>, in nearby <a href="Beaminster">Beaminster</a>, which runs in the opposite direction to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> at <a href="Axmouth">Axmouth</a> in Devon. The two rivers give their names to Parrett and Axe Parish Council.

From its source, the Parrett runs north through <a href="South%20Perrott">South Perrott</a> and under the <a href="West%20of%20England%20Main%20Line">Salisbury to Exeter railway line</a> before passing to the west of <a href="North%20Perrott">North Perrott</a> and <a href="Haselbury%20Plucknett">Haselbury Plucknett</a>. It then runs through fields between <a href="Merriott">Merriott</a> to the west and <a href="West%20Chinnock">West Chinnock</a> and <a href="Chiselborough">Chiselborough</a> to the east. Passing under the <a href="A303%20road">A303 road</a> to the east of <a href="South%20Petherton">South Petherton</a>, the river flows between <a href="East%20Lambrook">East Lambrook</a> and <a href="Bower%20Hinton">Bower Hinton</a> west of <a href="Martock">Martock</a> and then towards <a href="Kingsbury%20Episcopi">Kingsbury Episcopi</a>, through <a href="Thorney%2C%20Somerset">Thorney</a> and <a href="Muchelney">Muchelney</a>, passing the remains of <a href="Muchelney%20Abbey">Muchelney Abbey</a> before entering <a href="Langport">Langport</a>, which is about north of Chiselborough. Below Thorney Bridge the river's banks have been raised to mitigate flooding.

The Parrett then flows northwest for approximately another to Bridgwater through the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a> past <a href="Aller%2C%20Somerset">Aller</a>, close to the <a href="Aller%20and%20Beer%20Woods">Aller and Beer Woods</a> and <a href="Aller%20Hill">Aller Hill</a> <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI). The sluice gate (formerly a <a href="Canal%20lock">lock</a> built in the late 1830s) at the <a href="deserted%20medieval%20village">deserted medieval village</a> of Oath marks the river's <a href="Head%20of%20tide">tidal limit</a>. The river then crosses <a href="Southlake%20Moor">Southlake Moor</a>. The next major landmark along the river's course is <a href="Burrow%20Mump">Burrow Mump</a>, an ancient earthwork owned by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>. The river then arrives in <a href="Burrowbridge">Burrowbridge</a>, where the old pumping station building was once a museum. Flowing north, it passes <a href="Langmead%20and%20Weston%20Level">Langmead and Weston Level</a> SSSI, and on past the land-drainage pumping station at <a href="Westonzoyland%20Pumping%20Station%20Museum">Westonzoyland</a>.

Further downstream the river passes the village of <a href="Huntworth">Huntworth</a> before flowing under the <a href="M5%20motorway">M5 motorway</a> at Dunwear. As it enters Bridgwater it passes under Somerset and Hamp Bridges, and past <a href="Bridgwater%20Castle">Bridgwater Castle</a>, which had a tidal <a href="moat">moat</a> up to wide in places, fed by water from the river. From Bridgwater to the sea is approximately . The <a href="King%27s%20Sedgemoor%20Drain">King's Sedgemoor Drain</a> empties into the River Parrett next to the wharf at Dunball; it enters via a <a href="Sluice">clyce</a> (or clyse), which is a local word for a sluice. The clyce has been moved about downstream from its original position and now obstructs the entrance to the small harbour next to the wharf.
The course of the river below Bridgwater is now somewhat straighter than in former times. The village of <a href="Combwich">Combwich</a> lies adjacent to a channel in the river known as "Combwich Reach"; from here the Parrett flows to the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a> past the <a href="Steart%20Peninsula">Steart Peninsula</a>. <a href="Cartography">Cartographic</a> evidence indicates that in the early 18th century the peninsula was longer than at present. A "neck" started to form in the peninsula, and by 1802 the tip had broken off to form <a href="Stert%20Island">Stert Island</a>. Fenning Island also broke away but has rejoined the peninsula. Much of the peninsula's northern end eroded away or now exists as "islands" visible at low tide within an <a href="Intertidal%20zone">intertidal</a> area of mud known as the Stert Flats.

The mouth at <a href="Burnham-on-Sea">Burnham-on-Sea</a> is a <a href="National%20nature%20reserves%20in%20England">nature reserve</a> where the river flows into <a href="Bridgwater%20Bay">Bridgwater Bay</a> on the Bristol Channel. In addition to the rivers Parrett, <a href="River%20Brue">Brue</a> and <a href="Washford%20River">Washford</a>, several of the man-made drainage ditches, including the <a href="River%20Huntspill">River Huntspill</a> from the Somerset Levels, and the Cannington Brook from the "<a href="Pawlett%2C%20Somerset">Pawlett</a> Hams", also discharge into the bay.

The Parrett has only one gauging station, at Chiselborough, fairly close to the source. It measures flow from the first of the <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>, or about 4.3 per cent of the total. The mean flow measured by the <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> at Chiselborough was , with a peak of on 30 May 1979 and a minimum of over a seven-day period in August 1976. Tributaries of the Parrett with gauging stations include the Yeo, Isle, Cary, and Tone.

The lower Parrett has a fall of only between Langport and Bridgwater. To the northeast of the River Parrett's mouth, the Bristol Channel becomes the <a href="Severn%20Estuary">Severn Estuary</a>, which has a <a href="tidal%20range">tidal range</a> of . The rate and direction of flow of the Parrett is therefore dependent on the state of the tide on the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. In common with the lower reaches of the River Severn, the Parrett experiences a <a href="tidal%20bore">tidal bore</a>. Certain combinations of the tides funnel the rising water into a wave that travels upstream at about , against the river's current.

Near the source at Chiselborough the typical level range for the depth of the river is to but has reached a maximum of . The mean flow rate is . By the time it reaches Gaw Bridge the normal level range is to and a highest reading of . At West Quay in Bridgwater where the river is tidal the highest astronomical tide level is above <a href="ordnance%20datum">ordnance datum</a> (AOD).

For the purpose of water quality measurement the river is divided into five water body areas by the <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a>. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality. The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for ecological quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.

The origin of the name Parrett is unclear, but several derivations from the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a> used in <a href="Wales">Wales</a> have been suggested. Priestley-Evans suggests, "Parrett has been said to be a form of the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "pared", a partition, and that it was the name which the Welsh people of Somerset and Devon gave to that river because it was at one time the dividing line between themselves and the Saxons". Another spelling, "parwydydd", is also translated as partition. Another explanation from Welsh, "Peraidd", meaning "the sweet or delicious river", has also been suggested. An alternative explanation, based on <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, is a derivation from "Pedair" or "Pedride" from "pedr", meaning four and the <a href="Cornish%20language">Old Cornish</a> "Rit" meaning flow, which in this case would relate to the four flows or streams: the Tone, Yeo, Isle and Parrett. This is based on the explanation given in Ekwall's 1928 book "English River Names". Whichever derivation is correct, the name Parrett and its spelling variations have been in use since the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> era, as evidenced by the addition of "-tun" onto river names as seen in the local towns <a href="North%20Petherton">North Petherton</a> and South Petherton. The spelling "Pedred" and "Pedrida" are also mentioned in connection with the Parrett. The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names states only that the name is a 'pre-English river-name of obscure origin'.

The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are believed to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> and later Anglo-Saxon and <a href="Norman%20dynasty">Norman</a> occupation. Roman Somerset, which lasted for over 250 years until around the beginning of the 5th century, had various settlements, including <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> ("<a href="Aquae%20Sulis">Aquae Sulis</a>"), <a href="Ilchester">Ilchester</a> ("<a href="Lindinis">Lindinis</a>") and lead mines at <a href="Charterhouse%20Roman%20Town">Charterhouse</a>; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was in use between the first and the fourth centuries. Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid-1970s, during motorway construction works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the <a href="Polden%20Hills">Polden Hills</a> to the <a href="Fosse%20Way">Fosse Way</a>, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the largest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with large <a href="Granary">granaries</a>, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the <a href="River%20Yeo%20%28South%20Somerset%29">Ilchester Yeo</a> by means of a paved ford. The Yeo was navigable by small craft all the way to the Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester; however, disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester. The Yeo may already have been straightened and <a href="canal">canal</a>ised before Roman occupation.

The Parrett was established as the border between the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and the <a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Brythonic</a> kingdom of <a href="Dumnonia">Dumnonia</a> in 658, following the Dumnonians' defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Peonnum">Battle of Peonnum</a> that year. This natural border endured for almost a century until further fighting between the Anglo-Saxons and Britons in the mid-8th century, when the border shifted west to its current location between the modern <a href="Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">ceremonial counties</a> of Somerset and <a href="Devon">Devon</a>. It is thought a <a href="Ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a>, usable only at low tide, crossed the river near its mouth, between Combwich and Pawlett (east bank). This crossing, at the western end of the Polden Hills, was known since Roman times and lay on the route of a Saxon "<a href="herepath">herepath</a>". It was here, or in the immediate vicinity, that Hubba, the Danish raider, was defeated and killed by <a href="Odda%2C%20Ealdorman%20of%20Devon">Odda</a> in 878. In the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" Combwich was known as Comich, which means "the settlement by the water", from the Old English "cumb" and "wic". The ford was later replaced by a ferry, one of which was in operation from at least the 13th century. In the 15th century the ferry was regarded as part of the "King's Highway", and both passengers and cattle were carried in the 16th and 17th centuries. Records of the joint <a href="Manorialism">Manorial</a> ownership and costs of the ferry exist for 1589 and 1810. The "White House Inn", a <a href="licensed%20victualler">licensed victualler</a> and part-owner of the ferry, traded on the Pawlett bank from 1655 to 1897; the building was retained as a farm dwelling for another 20 years. The Combwich river crossing, which was a main route until the 18th century, fell out of use due to <a href="turnpike%20trusts">turnpike trusts</a> improving what were to become the <a href="A38%20road">A38</a> and <a href="A39%20road">A39 road</a>s, and traffic went via Bridgwater; the former inn was demolished c. 1930.

After the departure of the Romans, the low-lying Somerset Levels appear to have been abandoned, as the <a href="archaeological%20record">archaeological record</a> shows that they were flooded and the former Roman landscape covered with a thick layer of <a href="Alluvium">alluvial</a> deposits. Recovery of the levels involved both the construction of sea walls and the containment of the Parrett. <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a> came to the remoter areas of the Somerset Levels, making use of "island" sites. <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a>, possibly founded in the 7th century (or earlier), was nearby and had undertaken extensive water management to enable it to bring materials by boat to Glastonbury, albeit not via the Parrett. Muchelney Abbey, founded in the mid-8th century, was sited at the confluence of the Parrett and its tributaries, the rivers <a href="River%20Isle">Isle</a> and Yeo; and <a href="Athelney%20Abbey">Athelney Abbey</a> lay on another tributary, the <a href="River%20Tone">River Tone</a>. These three abbeys together with the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a> were major landowners with fishing and <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian</a> rights, often conflicting, on these rivers. They gained financially from improvements to land and waterways due to the resulting greater fertility of their lands and the increased <a href="renting">rents</a> that they were able to charge their tenants.
Continuing land reclamation and control of the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by improvement. Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> by Glastonbury Abbey. Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed of <a href="meadow">meadow</a> recovered around the "island" of Sowy; from the accounts in the Abbey's rent books, this had increased to by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. After the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a> in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came under the control of the Crown, particularly <a href="King%27s%20Sedgemoor">King's Sedgemoor</a>, which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey, with <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI's</a> Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for land improvements. Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500 years. In 1597, of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; three further reclamations, totalling , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660. Kings <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a>, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, and <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> continued to improve King's Sedgemoor.
Attempts were also made to improve navigation on the lower river. Between 1677 and 1678, Sir John Moulton cut a new channel at "Vikings Creek" on the Horsey Levels to remove a large <a href="meander">meander</a>; the old river bed soon silted up, providing of new land. A further scheme was proposed in 1723 to improve navigation, shorten the journey time for boats, and recover land by obtaining an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> to make an artificial cut across the Steart Peninsula. Eventually, after much debate, the cut was not made due to lack of land owner support and concerns over costs and risks. The <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> put a stop to most reclamation work; however, in 1764 a <a href="clyse">clyse</a> was built at <a href="Dunball">Dunball</a> to contain tidal influences on a run-off stream near King's Sedgemoor. Extensive land recovery was undertaken in the Somerset Levels by land owners between 1770 and the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in 1815, as part of a general scheme of <a href="British%20Agricultural%20Revolution">agricultural improvements</a>, including improvements to the Brue Valley and to King's Sedgemoor. The latter involved the connection of various drainage schemes into a new hand-dug channel connected to the clyse at Dunball – the King's Sedgemoor Drain. Further drainage improvements were needed in the 19th century, which involved the use of mechanical <a href="Beam%20engine">pumping engines</a>, originally steam powered but later powered by electricity. In January 1940, further improvements were funded by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a>, during the Second World War, as "Priority War Work" during the construction of <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory">Royal Ordnance Factory</a> (ROF) <a href="ROF%20Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a>. This involved doubling the width of the King's Sedgemoor Drain at its western end and the excavation of the <a href="River%20Huntspill">River Huntspill</a>. In the longer-term this provided a drain for the Brue valley, but in war-time the scheme provided a guaranteed daily supply of of water for the ROF.

The town of <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a>, from "Brigewaltier" (place at) the bridge held by <a href="Walter%20of%20Douai">Walter of Douai</a>, or alternatively "Brugie" from Old English "brycg" meaning gang plank between ships, or from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "brygja" meaning quay, was founded as a new <a href="borough">borough</a> about 1200; it had a castle and a market and became a port in its own right. It was the major port for Somerset which, around the <a href="Quantock%20Hills">Quantocks</a>, the <a href="Brendon%20Hills">Brendon Hills</a> and the Tone valley, was mainly agricultural, producing <a href="arable%20land">arable</a> crops and vegetables to supply the new industrial towns. Combwich was the traditional River Parrett <a href="Maritime%20pilot">pilots'</a> harbour from at least the 14th century. It also served as a port for the export of local produce and, from the 15th century, the import of timber. Until the late 1930s, when the creek silted up, coastal shipping served Combwich's local brick and coal yard.

In the medieval era the river was used to transport <a href="Hamstone">Hamstone</a> from the quarry at <a href="Ham%20Hill%2C%20Somerset">Ham Hill</a> for the construction of churches throughout the county. Later, in the 19th century, coal from south Wales, for heating, <a href="Bath%20brick">Bath brick</a>s, bricks and <a href="tile">tile</a>s would be carried. Brick making, which had been carried out intermittently in Bridgwater from the 17th century, by the late 18th century had expanded into an industry based on permanent brickyards in the Bridgwater area adjacent to the Parrett. The brick and tile industry made use of the local alluvial clays and the Parrett's coastal trade, using <a href="ketch">ketch</a>es mostly based at Bridgwater to transport their products, which were heavy and bulky, and to bring in coal to heat the <a href="kiln">kiln</a>s. The 19th century <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">industrial revolution</a> opened up mass markets leading to further expansion of the industry, particularly beginning in 1850 when the duty (tax) on bricks was abolished. Brick and tile works, making use of river transport, were opened in the 1840s and 1850s south of Bridgwater at North Petherton and Dunwear, in Bridgwater itself, and downstream at Chilton Trinity, Combwich, <a href="Puriton">Puriton</a> and Pawlett. Numerous brickworks were also opened elsewhere in Somerset, but many of them used the railways to transport their products; some 264 sites are listed in the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society's "Gazetteer of sites". Silt was also dredged from the river over a stretch between Somerset Bridge and Castle Fields, Bridgwater, to make Bath bricks, an early abrasive cleaning material patented in 1827.

Bridgwater was part of the <a href="Port%20of%20Bristol">Port of Bristol</a> until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348, covering of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe. Under an 1845 Act of Parliament the Port of Bridgwater extends from <a href="Brean%20Down">Brean Down</a> to <a href="Hinkley%20Point">Hinkley Point</a> in Bridgwater Bay, and includes parts of the River Parrett (to Bridgwater), River Brue and the River Axe.

Historically, the main port on the river was at Bridgwater, where a span crossed the river from 1200 AD onwards. <a href="Wharf">Quay</a>s were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the "Langport slip", being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge. A <a href="custom%20house">custom house</a> was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the "Irene" launched in 1907.

The river was navigable, with care, to Bridgwater Town Bridge by vessels. By trans-shipping goods into barges at the Town Bridge, the Parrett was navigable as far as Langport and (via the River Yeo) to Ilchester. After 1827, it was also possible to transport goods to <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a> via the <a href="Bridgwater%20and%20Taunton%20Canal">Bridgwater and Taunton Canal</a> at Huntworth. A <a href="floating%20dock%20%28impounded%29">floating harbour</a>, known as the "docks", was constructed between 1837–1841, and the canal was extended through Bridgwater to the floating harbour. The dock area contained <a href="flour%20mill">flour mill</a>s, timber yards and <a href="Ship-chandler">chandlers</a>.

Shipping to Bridgwater expanded with the construction of the docks, which opened on 25 March 1841, and reached a peak in the 19th century between 1880 and 1885, with an average of 3,600 ships per year entering the port. Peak <a href="tonnage">tonnage</a> occurred in 1857, with 142 vessels totaling . In the short term, the opening of the docks increased the profitability of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which carried of cargo in 1840. This peaked in 1847 at of cargo; however, by the mid-1850s the canal was bankrupt due to competition from the railways.

Combwich Pill, a small creek near the mouth of the river, had been used for shipping since the 14th century. From the 1830s, with the development of the brick and tile industry in the Combwich area, the wharf was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. This traffic ceased in the 1930s; in the late 1950s the wharf was taken over and upgraded by the <a href="Central%20Electricity%20Generating%20Board">Central Electricity Generating Board</a> (CEGB) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. Construction of <a href="Hinkley%20Point%20A%20nuclear%20power%20station">Hinkley Point A nuclear power station</a> was ordered in 1957, with a scheduled completion date of 1960, but was not completed until 1965. This was followed by <a href="Hinkley%20Point%20B%20Nuclear%20Power%20Station">Hinkley Point B nuclear power station</a>, which began operation in 1976. It is proposed to use the wharf again for the construction of <a href="Hinkley%20Point%20C%20nuclear%20power%20station">Hinkley Point C</a>.

Dunball wharf was built in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants, and was linked to the <a href="Bristol%20and%20Exeter%20Railway">Bristol and Exeter Railway</a> by a rail track which crossed the A38. The link was built in 1876, also by coal merchants, and was originally operated as a horse-drawn <a href="tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a>. In 1875, the local landowner built The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf.

The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which had been bought out by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866 and later passed into the control of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> had, by the beginning of the First World War, fallen into disrepair due to lack of trade. This trade, particularly the Wales-Somerset traffic after the opening of the <a href="Severn%20Tunnel">Severn Tunnel</a> in 1886, had been lost to the railways; the canal continued to be used as a source of water. In the mid-1950s, the Port of Bridgwater was importing some of cargo, mainly sand and coal by tonnage, followed by timber and flour. It was also exporting some of bricks and tiles. By then, Bridgwater's brick and tile industry was in terminal decline. In the 1960s, <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>, the owner of the docks, which were limited by the size of its locks to boats of maximum size , decided that they were commercially non-viable. British Railways offered to sell the docks to any buyer; however, there were no takers, so the docks were closed to river traffic.

Although ships no longer dock in the town of Bridgwater, of cargo were handled within the port authority's area in 2006, most of which was stone products via the wharf at Dunball. It is no longer linked to the railway system. The link was removed in the 1960s as part of the railway closures following the <a href="Beeching%20cuts">Beeching Report</a>. <a href="Dunball%20railway%20station">Dunball railway station</a>, which had opened in 1873, was closed to both passengers and goods in 1964. All traces of the station, other than "Station Road", have been removed. The wharf is now used for landing stone products, mainly marine sand and gravels dredged in the Bristol Channel. Marine sand and gravel accounted for of the total tonnage of using the Port facilities in 2006, with salt products accounting for in the same year, while the roll-on roll-off berth at Combwich is used occasionally for the transfer of heavy goods for the two existing Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. With the possible future construction of the two <a href="Hinkley%20Point%20C%20nuclear%20power%20station">Hinkley Point C nuclear power station</a>s by <a href="EDF%20Energy">EDF Energy</a>, it is proposed that Combwich wharf be employed to transfer heavy goods to the sites. Combwich Pill is the only site where recreational moorings are available in the estuary.

<a href="Sedgemoor">Sedgemoor District Council</a> acts as the Competent Harbour Authority for the port, and has provided pilotage services for all boats over using the river since 1998, when it took over the service from <a href="Trinity%20House">Trinity House</a>. Pilotage is important because of the constant changes in the navigable channel resulting from the large tidal range, which can exceed on spring tides. Most commercial shipping travels upriver as far as Dunball wharf, which handles bulk cargoes.

The Parrett Navigation was a series of improvements to the river to allow increased boat traffic between Burrowbridge and Thorney. The work, done in the 1830s and 1840s, was made mostly obsolete by the coming of railways in 1853, though some aspects survive to this day.

Trade on the river upstream of Bridgwater had developed during the 18th century, with barges operating between Bridgwater and Langport, while smaller barges carrying operated on the upper reaches between Langport and Thorney, and along the River Yeo to Long Load Bridge and Ilchester. The channel below the junction with the <a href="River%20Tone">River Tone</a> had been improved as a result of Acts of Parliament passed in 1699 and 1707, "for making and keeping the River Tone navigable from Bridgewater to Taunton", and a third act with a similar purpose was passed in 1804. Traffic on the higher reaches was hindered by <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s in the river and by the Great Bow Bridge at Langport, which consisted on nine small arches, none of them big enough for navigation. All cargoes heading upstream had to be off-loaded from the bigger barges, carried to the other side of the bridge, and reloaded into the smaller barges. Traffic above Langport was sporadic, as the water levels were often inadequate, forcing boats to wait several days for the right conditions before proceeding.

The abortive <a href="Ivelchester%20and%20Langport%20Navigation">Ivelchester and Langport Navigation</a> scheme had sought to avoid the Great Bow Bridge by making the Portlake Rhine navigable, rebuilding Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport, and making a new cut to Bicknell's Bridge. Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned, but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties. After the cessation of hostilities with France at the beginning of the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824, the <a href="Glastonbury%20Canal">Glastonbury Canal</a> in 1827, and the <a href="Chard%20Canal">Chard Canal</a> in 1834.

When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was opened in 1827, it joined the Parrett by a lock at Huntworth, where a <a href="Canal%20basin">basin</a> was constructed, but in 1841 the canal was extended to the new floating harbour in Bridgwater, and the Huntworth link was filled in. The canal and river were not re-connected at this point when the canal was restored, because the tidal Parrett, at Huntworth, is a <a href="Brackish%20water">salt water</a> river laden with silt whereas the canal contains <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a>. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> for Bridgwater's population.

With the prospect of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and <a href="Walter%20Bagehot">Walter Bagehot</a>, who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Brunel</a> and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.

The Parrett Navigation Act allowed the proprietors, of whom 25 were named, to raise £10,500 in shares and £3,300 by mortgage, with which to make improvements to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney. The River Isle, which joined the Parrett at Muchelney, was to be improved for its first mile, and then the <a href="Westport%20Canal">Westport Canal</a> was to be constructed from there to <a href="Westport%2C%20Somerset">Westport</a>. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney. An extra lock was added at <a href="Oath%2C%20Somerset">Oath</a>, when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra £20,000 to be raised. The lock at Oath has since been replaced by a sluice gate to control flooding.

The section below Langport opened on 28 October 1839; the section to Thorney and the Westport Canal were completed in August 1840. The Langport Bridge was not finished until March 1841; of the £3,749 cost of construction, £500 came from the Langport Corporation and the rest was raised by a bridge toll operated from March 1841 until January 1843. The total cost of the works was £38,876, and no dividends were paid until 1853, as all profits were used to repay the loans which had been taken out. There are no records of traffic, but it has been estimated at per year, based on the toll receipts and the knowledge that the Stuckey and Bagehot boats carried about three quarters of the total tonnage.

The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened in late 1853, and the effects on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite petitions from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only. Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until the early years of the 20th century. There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.

Much of the history of the river is defined by its bridges, which are described from here mouth to source. The Drove Bridge, which marks the current extent of the Port of Bridgwater, is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river. With a span of , the bridge was constructed as part of the Bridgwater Northern Distributor road scheme (1992), and provides a navigable channel which is wide with headroom at normal spring high tides. Upstream of this is the <a href="retractable%20bridge">retractable</a> or <a href="Telescopic%20Bridge%2C%20Bridgwater">Telescopic Bridge</a>, built in 1871 to the design of <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Fox">Sir Francis Fox</a>, the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a <a href="broad%20gauge">broad gauge</a> (later <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a>) railway siding over the river to the docks, and was movable, to allow boats to proceed up river. An section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways, so that the main girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was wide. It was manually operated for the first eight months, and then powered by a steam engine, reverting to manual operation in 1913, when the steam engine failed. The bridge was last opened in 1953, and the traverser section was demolished in 1974, but public outcry at this resulted in the bridge being listed as a <a href="Scheduled%20monument">Scheduled monument</a>, and the rest of the bridge was kept. It was later used as a road crossing, until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it, and is now only used by pedestrians. Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977.

The next bridge is the Town Bridge. There has been a bridge here since the 13th century, when Bridgwater was granted a charter by <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a>. The present bridge was designed by R. C. Else and G. B. Laffan, and the <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> structure was completed in 1883. It replaced an earlier iron bridge, which was completed in 1797 and was the first cast iron bridge to be built in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. The stone abutments of that bridge were reused for the later bridge, which was the only road crossing of the river in Bridgwater until 1958. Above the bridge there were two shoals, called The Coals and The Stones, which were a hazard to barge traffic on the river, and <a href="wikt%3Abargee">bargees</a> had to navigate the river at high tide, when there was enough water to carry them over these obstructions. In March 1958 a new reinforced concrete road bridge, the Blake Bridge, was opened as part of a bypass to take traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater. It now carries the A38 and A39 roads. At the southern edge of Bridgwater is a bridge which carries the Bristol and Exeter Railway across the River Parrett. Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed a brick bridge, known as the <a href="Bridgwater%20railway%20station%23Somerset%20Bridge">Somerset Bridge</a>, with a span but a rise of just . Work started in 1838 and was completed in 1841. Brunel left the centring scaffold in place, as the foundations were still settling, but had to remove it in 1843 to reopen the river for navigation. Brunel demolished the brick arch and replaced it with a timber arch within six months without interrupting the traffic on the railway. This was in turn replaced in 1904 by a steel girder bridge. Slightly further east is a modern concrete bridge which carries the M5 motorway over both the river and the railway line. It was started in 1971 and opened in 1973.

Before 1826, the bridge at Burrowbridge, just below the junction with the River Tone, consisted of three arches, each only a little wider than the barges that used the river. They restricted the flow of water in times of flood and made navigation difficult. The bridge was highlighted in a report made by William Armstrong in 1824, as a factor which would prevent the River Tone Navigation competing with the new Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, then being built. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1824 by the Turnpike Commissioners, authorising the construction of a new bridge and the removal of the old. A design for a single-span bridge in cast iron was dropped because of the cost of cast iron at the time, and instead a stone bridge was built, which was completed in 1826. This is the longest single span masonry road bridge in the county, and was also the last <a href="toll%20bridge">toll bridge</a> in Somerset until it was "freed" in 1946. It now carries the <a href="A361%20road">A361 road</a>. Just below the bridge there was a shoal of rocks and stones, which was also mentioned in Armstrong's report, but no action was taken to remove it. Except at spring tides, Burrowbridge was the normal upper limit for barges riding the incoming tide. Above here, horses were used to pull the boats, either towards Langport or along the River Tone towards Taunton.

Stanmoor lock was constructed above the junction with the River Tone, but all traces of it have gone. Next to the pedestrian bridge at <a href="Stathe">Stathe</a> four living willow cones, which were woven in 1997 by Clare Wilks, have now rooted and sprouted. Oath lock no longer functions as a lock, but the sluice is used to regulate the river levels. Below Langport, the river is crossed by a lattice girder bridge, carrying the <a href="Reading%20to%20Taunton%20Line">Taunton to Westbury railway line</a>, which approaches the crossing on multi-arched viaducts. This is followed by the derelict remains of the Langport lock and sluice.
At Langport, the Great Bow Bridge, which now carries the <a href="A378%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A378</a>, is a three-arched bridge, constructed under the terms of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836. Completed in 1841 at a cost of £3,749, it replaced the previous medieval bridge, with its nine tiny arches, all too small to allow navigation. A bridge at this site was first mentioned in 1220. The medieval bridge consisted of a total of 31 arches, of which nine crossed the river, and 19 of the original arches were located by ground-penetrating radar in 1987, buried beneath the road which runs from Great Bow Bridge to Little Bow Bridge. The <a href="Warehouse%2C%20Langport">Warehouse</a> in Langport was built in the late 18th century of <a href="English%20bond">English bond</a> red brick, with <a href="Flemish%20bond">Flemish bond</a> extensions. It has clay plain tile roofs with <a href="Hip%20roof">hipped</a> ends. It was built by the <a href="Parrett%20Navigation%20Company">Parrett Navigation Company</a>, a trading company owned by Vincent Stuckey and <a href="Walter%20Bagehot">Walter Bagehot</a>, on the banks of the River. When the river became unnavigable, the building was no longer needed, and it was eventually abandoned. The Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, which became the Ecos Trust, purchased the site, designated as a <a href="Brownfield%20land">brown field site</a>, in February 2003, and worked with <a href="Somerset%20Buildings%20Preservation%20Trust">Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust</a>, <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and local councils to redevelop it into a craft, heritage learning and small business centre, with the surrounding land being used for an eco-friendly housing development. It is a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the <a href="River%20Parrett%20Trail">River Parrett Trail</a>. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from <a href="Huish%20Episcopi">Huish Episcopi</a> to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the <a href="South%20Somerset%20Hydropower%20Group">South Somerset Hydropower Group</a>. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of <a href="Ham%20stone">Ham stone</a> in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the <a href="Parrett%20Iron%20Works">Parrett Iron Works</a>, founded in 1855 on the site of a former <a href="snuff%20%28tobacco%29">snuff</a> mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, <a href="ropewalk">ropewalk</a>, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near <a href="Norton-sub-Hamdon">Norton-sub-Hamdon</a> and the <a href="A356%20road">A356</a> near Chedington.

The waters of the Severn Estuary, which are heavily laden with silt, flow into the lower reaches of the Parrett and the Tone on each tide. This silt can rapidly gather on the banks of the rivers, reducing the capacity and performance of the channel, and increasing the risk of flooding of surrounding land.

The river is a <a href="highland%20carrier">highland carrier</a>, as it is embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at <a href="Westonzoyland">Westonzoyland</a> was built in 1830, the first <a href="pump">mechanical pumping station</a> on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, <a href="Middlezoy">Middlezoy</a> and <a href="Othery">Othery</a>, and the success of the <a href="Drainage%20system%20%28agriculture%29">drainage system</a> led to the formation of <a href="Internal%20drainage%20board">Internal drainage board</a>s and the construction of other <a href="pumping%20station">pumping station</a>s.

The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and <a href="scoop%20wheel">scoop wheel</a>, which is similar to a water wheel, except that it is driven round by the engine and lifts water up to a higher level. After 25 years, there were problems pumping the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out. A better method was sought, and in 1861 a replacement pump was installed. The engine was built by <a href="Easton%20and%20Amos">Easton and Amos</a> of London, to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a twin cylinder, vertical condensing engine, driving a <a href="centrifugal%20pump">centrifugal pump</a>. A similar engine was on display at the <a href="The%20Great%20Exhibition">Great Exhibition of 1851</a> and was shown to be able to lift 100 tons of water per minute (1,700 L/s), to a height of . The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the <a href="rhyne">rhyne</a> (pronounced "reen") into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, when a new diesel-powered pumping station, capable of pumping 35 tons per minute (600 L/s) at any state of the tide, was built beside the old one. The pumping station is now an Industrial Heritage museum of steam powered machinery and land drainage, and houses most of the equipment from the disused Burrowbridge pumping station.

The Somerset River Authority was established in the 1960s, and later became part of <a href="Wessex%20Water">Wessex Water</a>. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river, and the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.

Various measures including <a href="Sluice">sluice gates</a>, known locally as "clyce", have been deployed to try and control flooding. Completed in 1972, the <a href="Sowy%20River">Sowy River</a> is a embanked channel which starts at Monks Leaze clyce below Langport, and carries excess water from the river to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain, from where it flows to the estuary by gravity, rejoining the Parrett near Dunball wharf. Construction of the channel, together with improvements to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball, to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river, cost £1.4 million. The scheme has resulted in less flooding on Aller Moor.

In the 1970s a study was commissioned by Wessex Water to investigate the likely effects of constructing a tide-excluding barrier, aimed at stopping the silt, just upriver of Dunball Wharf on the hydraulic, sedimentary and pollutant regime of the estuary. Results showed that a site further upriver could be viable.

The area around the estuary, known as Parrett Reach, around the Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. As a result, the <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> produced the <a href="Stolford">Stolford</a> to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study in 2002, to examine options for the future. In July 2010 the Environment Agency presented plans to convert the peninsula into wetland habitat. It was claimed to be the largest wetland habitat creation scheme in England. The old sea-wall has been breached to let <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a> develop.

Following summer floods of 1997 and the prolonged flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly funded by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> <a href="European%20Regional%20Development%20Fund">Regional Development Fund</a>, by 30 organisations, including <a href="British%20Waterways">British Waterways</a>, <a href="Campaign%20to%20Protect%20Rural%20England">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a>, <a href="Countryside%20Agency">Countryside Agency</a>, <a href="Department%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a>, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, <a href="National%20Farmers%20Union%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">National Farmers Union</a>, Sedgemoor, <a href="Somerset%20County%20Council">Somerset County Council</a>, <a href="South%20Somerset">South Somerset District Council</a>, <a href="Taunton%20Deane">Taunton Deane</a> and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make a significant contribution to reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.

During the <a href="winter%20flooding%20of%202013%E2%80%9314%20on%20the%20Somerset%20Levels">winter flooding of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels</a> the River Parrett overflowed at new year, during the rain and storms from <a href="Cyclone%20Dirk">Storm Dirk</a>, with many residents asking for the Environment Agency to resume river dredging. On 24 January 2014, in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the <a href="2013%E2%80%932014%20United%20Kingdom%20winter%20floods">winter storms of 2013–14 in the United Kingdom</a>, both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a <a href="Emergency%20management%23United%20Kingdom">major incident</a>, as defined under the <a href="Civil%20Contingencies%20Act%202004">Civil Contingencies Act 2004</a>. At this time, with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month, the village of Thorney was abandoned and Muchelney was cut off by flood waters for almost a month. <a href="Northmoor%20Green">Northmoor Green</a>, which is more commonly known as Moorland, was also severely affected. By the end of January, of agricultural land, including <a href="North%20Moor">North Moor</a>, <a href="Curry%20and%20Hay%20Moors">Curry and Hay Moors</a> and <a href="Greylake">Greylake</a>, had been under water for over a month. Bridgwater was partly flooded on 10 February 2014, when with 20,000 sandbags ready to be deployed. Over 600 houses were flooded, and both flooding and groundwater disrupted services including trains on the <a href="Bristol%20to%20Exeter%20Line">Bristol to Exeter Line</a> between Bridgwater and Taunton.

As a result of the extensive flooding, more funds were allocted to dredge the Parrett, although there are doubts as to whether this is an effective solution to the problem of flooding. Also, earlier proposals for a <a href="tidal%20barrage">tidal barrage</a> across the Parrett were reviewed, and new proposals were suggested to construct the barrage at an estimated cost of between £26,000 and £100,000. Further planning and construction could take up to ten years. The <a href="Inland%20Waterways%20Association">Inland Waterways Association</a> has suggested that the barrage should include a <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">lock</a> to enable boats to travel to Bridgwater and potentially to reopen the link to the harbour and the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal.

Close to the source of the river the underlying geology is a thin layer of <a href="Fuller%27s%20earth">Fuller's earth</a> clay over <a href="Yeovil%20Sands">Yeovil Sands</a>. The resulting light soil made the area important for the production of <a href="flax">flax</a> and for market gardening in the past.
Burrow Mump, an ancient earthwork owned by the National Trust, is a natural hill of <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> capped by <a href="Keuper%20marl">Keuper marl</a>, standing at a strategic point where the <a href="River%20Tone">River Tone</a> and the old course of the <a href="River%20Cary">River Cary</a> join the River Parrett. It probably served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of <a href="Athelney">Athelney</a> at the end of the 9th century.

The Levels and Moors are a largely flat area in which there are some slightly raised parts, called "burtles" as well as higher ridges and hills. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of <a href="Permanent%20vegetative%20cover">permanent</a> grass, surrounded by ditches lined with <a href="willow">willow</a> trees. Access to the Levels and Moors is by <a href="Drovers%27%20road">"droves"</a>, i.e. green lanes. The Levels are a coastal sand and clay barrier about above mean sea level (roughly west of the M5 motorway) whereas the inland Moors can be below peak tides and have large areas of <a href="peat">peat</a>. The geology of the area is that of two basins mainly surrounded by hills, the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and <a href="Sluice%23Regional%20names%20for%20sluice%20gates">clyces</a>. The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations, the worst of which in recorded history was the <a href="Bristol%20Channel%20floods%2C%201607">Bristol Channel floods of 1607</a>, which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, with houses and villages swept away, an estimated of farmland inundated and livestock destroyed. A further severe flood occurred in 1872–1873 when over were under water from October to March.

The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> times, and has been an ongoing practice since the levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting. This led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of over 100 years.

The river flows through several areas of ecological interest and supports a variety of rare and endangered species.

From January until May, the Parrett provides a source of <a href="European%20eel">European eel</a>s ("Anguilla anguilla") and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> play "<a href="Glass%20Eels">Glass Eels</a>" by <a href="Nell%20Leyshon">Nell Leyshon</a> was set on the Parrett.

To the north of the river bank northwest of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a <a href="Somerset%20Wildlife%20Trust">Somerset Wildlife Trust</a> reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural <a href="ancient%20woodland">ancient woodland</a> along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about and the underlying geology of most of it is <a href="Lias%20Group">Lias</a> <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. Prior to the 20th century it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional <a href="Coppicing">coppice</a> woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous <a href="Fraxinus">ash</a>/<a href="Ulmus%20glabra">wych elm</a> stand-type, with <a href="Quercus%20robur">pedunculate oak</a> ("Quercus robur"), and ash ("Fraxinus excelsior") the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm ("Ulmus glabra"). Ancient woodland indicators include <a href="Tilia%20cordata">small-leaved lime</a> ("Tilia cordata"), and <a href="Sorbus%20torminalis">wild service tree</a> ("Sorbus torminalis"), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include <a href="Neottia%20nidus-avis">bird's nest orchid</a> ("Neottia nidus-avis"), <a href="Platanthera%20chlorantha">greater butterfly orchid</a> ("Platanthera chlorantha") and the very rare Red Data Book species <a href="Lithospermum%20purpurocaeruleum">purple gromwell</a> ("Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum"). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by <a href="Festuca%20ovina">sheep's fescue</a> ("Festuca ovina") in combination with <a href="Trisetum%20flavescens">yellow oat-grass</a> ("Trisetum flavescens") and <a href="Briza%20media">quaking-grass</a> ("Briza media"). <a href="Sanguisorba%20minor">Salad burnet</a> ("Sanguisorba minor") forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species <a href="Althaea%20%28plant%29">rough marsh-mallow</a> ("Althaea hirsuta") and <a href="Gastridium%20ventricosum">nit-grass</a> ("Gastridium ventricosum"), also present.

Southlake Moor is another SSSI, which forms part of an extensive grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96 species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the <a href="Sium%20latifolium">greater water-parsnip</a> ("Sium latifolium"). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">wigeon</a> ("Anas penelope"), 250 <a href="Tundra%20swan">Bewick's swan</a> ("Cygnus bewickii") and good numbers of <a href="Common%20pochard">pochard</a> ("Aythya ferina"), <a href="Eurasian%20teal">teal</a> ("Anas crecca") and <a href="tufted%20duck">tufted duck</a> ("Aythya fuligula"). Signs of <a href="European%20otter">European otter</a>s ("Lutra lutra") are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches on the east side of the site are populated by <a href="palmate%20newt">palmate newt</a>s ("Triturus helveticus").

<a href="Langmead%20and%20Weston%20Level">Langmead and Weston Level</a> is nationally important for its species-rich neutral <a href="grassland">grassland</a> and the <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> community found in the ditches and rhynes. The terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates recorded on the site include four nationally
rare species: the <a href="Hydrophilus%20piceus">great silver diving beetle</a> ("Hydrophilus piceus"), the soldier fly "<a href="Odontomyia%20ornata">Odontomyia ornata</a>", which is now called the ornate brigadier, and two other <a href="Fly">flies</a>, "<a href="Lonchoptera%20scutellata">Lonchoptera scutellata</a>" and "<a href="Stenomicra%20cogani">Stenomicra cogani</a>".

The Parrett then flows through the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which contains a rich <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as <a href="Caltha%20palustris">marsh marigold</a> ("Caltha palustris"), <a href="Filipendula%20ulmaria">meadowsweet</a> ("Filipendula ulmaria") and <a href="Lychnis%20flos-cuculi">ragged robin</a> ("Lychnis flos-cuculi"). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan ("Cygnus columbianus bewickii"), <a href="Eurasian%20curlew">Eurasian curlew</a> ("Numenius arquata"), <a href="common%20redshank">common redshank</a> ("Tringa totanus"), <a href="Alauda">skylark</a> ("Alauda arvensis"), <a href="common%20snipe">common snipe</a> ("Gallinago gallinago"), common teal ("Anas crecca"), Eurasian wigeon ("Anas penelope") and <a href="whimbrel">whimbrel</a> ("Numenius phaeopus"), as well as birds of prey including the <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">western marsh harrier</a> ("Circus aeruginosus") and <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> ("Falco peregrinus"). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the <a href="hairy%20click%20beetle">hairy click beetle</a> ("Synaptus filiformis"), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the <a href="lesser%20silver%20water%20beetle">lesser silver water beetle</a> ("Hydrochara caraboides"), "<a href="Bagous%20nodulosus">Bagous nodulosus</a>", "<a href="Hydrophilus%20piceus">Hydrophilus piceus</a>", "<a href="Odontomyia%20angulata">Odontomyia angulata</a>", "<a href="Oulema%20erichsoni">Oulema erichsoni</a>" and "<a href="Valvata%20macrostoma">Valvata macrostoma</a>". In addition, the area supports an important European otter ("Lutra lutra") population. 282 <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a> ("Mustela vison") have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging <a href="European%20water%20vole">water voles</a> ("Arvicola amphibius") to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10 years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a>s), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Site</a> covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, <a href="Shapwick%20Heath">Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve</a>, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some of the Levels are recognised as an <a href="environmentally%20sensitive%20area">environmentally sensitive area</a>, while other portions are designated as <a href="Area%20of%20archaeological%20potential">Areas of High Archaeological Potential</a>. Despite this, there is currently no single <a href="conservation%20designation">conservation designation</a> covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.

On the outskirts of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s ("Sturnus vulgaris") each winter. The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of <a href="mudflat">mudflat</a>s, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a>. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.

The River Parrett Trail is a <a href="Long-distance%20footpaths%20in%20the%20UK">long-distance footpath</a> following the Parrett from its source to the sea. The river passes many landmarks and places of interest including: <a href="Burrow%20Hill%20Cider%20Farm">Burrow Hill Cider Farm</a>, Muchelney Abbey, <a href="West%20Sedgemoor">West Sedgemoor</a> (a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the <a href="Blake%20Museum">Blake Museum</a>, Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, the site of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedgemoor">Battle of Sedgemoor</a>, and finally discharges into Bridgwater Bay (another SSSI). The Langport and River Parrett Visitor Centre located at Langport details local life, history and wildlife.

Since 2000, attempts have been made to clarify the legal status and organisational responsibilities for the maintenance of the river and explore issues involving the sustainability and safe use of the waterway for a public trip boat and recreational craft. The work has identified economic and social benefits from the development of the Parrett navigation.

John Glenn

<a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921 – December 8, 2016) was a <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20aviator">United States Marine Corps aviator</a>, <a href="engineer">engineer</a>, <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>, businessman, and <a href="politician">politician</a>. He was the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times in 1962. Following his retirement from NASA, he served from 1974 to 1999 as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senator</a> from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>.

Before joining <a href="NASA">NASA</a>, Glenn was a distinguished <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Operation%20Beleaguer">China</a> and <a href="Korean%20War">Korea</a>. He shot down three <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a>s, and was awarded six <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Crosses</a> and eighteen <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>s. In 1957, he made the first <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> <a href="transcontinental%20flight">transcontinental flight</a> across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, panoramic photograph of the United States.

He was one of the <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a>, military <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>s selected in 1959 by NASA as the nation's first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the "<a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Friendship 7</a>" mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">NASA Distinguished Service Medal</a> in 1962 and the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> in 1978, was inducted into the <a href="U.S.%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame</a> in 1990, and was the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven.

Glenn resigned from NASA in January 1964. He planned to run for a <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Ohio">U.S. Senate seat from Ohio</a>, but an injury in February 1964 forced his withdrawal. He retired from the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> the following year. He lost a close <a href="Primary%20elections%20in%20the%20United%20States">primary election</a> in 1970. A member of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, Glenn first <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Ohio%2C%201974">won election to the Senate in 1974</a> and served for 24 years until January 1999. In 1998, while still a sitting Senator, Glenn flew on the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery">"Discovery"</a> space shuttle's <a href="STS-95">STS-95</a> mission, and became the oldest person to fly in space and the only person to fly in both the Mercury and <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle program</a>s. He received the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2012. He died at the age of 95 in 2016.

John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Ohio">Cambridge, Ohio</a>, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a plumbing firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, a member of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a>, left for the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The family moved to <a href="New%20Concord%2C%20Ohio">New Concord, Ohio</a>, soon after his birth, and his father started his own business, the Glenn Plumbing Company. Glenn Jr. was only a toddler when he met <a href="Annie%20Glenn">Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor</a>, who would later become his wife. The two would not be able to recall a time when they did not know each other. He first flew in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from <a href="balsa%20wood">balsa wood</a> kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold <a href="rhubarb">rhubarb</a> to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering "<a href="The%20Columbus%20Dispatch">The Columbus Dispatch</a>" newspaper. He was a member of the <a href="Boy%20Rangers%20of%20America">Ohio Rangers</a>, an organization similar to the <a href="Cub%20Scouting%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Cub Scouts</a>. His boyhood home in New Concord has been <a href="Building%20restoration">restored</a> as a <a href="historic%20house%20museum">historic house museum</a> and education center.

Glenn attended <a href="John%20Glenn%20High%20School%20%28New%20Concord%2C%20Ohio%29">New Concord High School</a>, where he played on the <a href="Varsity%20team">varsity</a> <a href="American%20football">football</a> team as a <a href="Center%20%28gridiron%20football%29">center</a> and <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a>. He also made the varsity <a href="basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="tennis">tennis</a> teams, and was involved with Hi-Y, a junior branch of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>. After graduating in 1939, Glenn entered <a href="Muskingum%20College">Muskingum College</a>, where he studied <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, was a member of the Stag Club fraternity, and played on the football team. Annie majored in music with minors in secretarial studies and physical education while competing on the <a href="Swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a> and <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a> teams. Glenn earned a <a href="private%20pilot%20license">private pilot license</a> and a physics course credit for free through the <a href="Civilian%20Pilot%20Training%20Program">Civilian Pilot Training Program</a> in 1941. He did not complete his senior year in residence or take a proficiency exam, both required by the school for its <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree.

When the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Glenn quit college to enlist in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">U.S. Army Air Corps</a>. He was never called to duty by the Army, and enlisted as a <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a href="Aviation%20Cadet%20Training%20Program%20%28USN%29">aviation cadet</a> in March 1942. Glenn attended the <a href="University%20of%20Iowa">University of Iowa</a> in <a href="Iowa%20City%2C%20Iowa">Iowa City</a> for pre-flight training and continued at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Olathe">Naval Air Station Olathe</a> in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> for primary training, where he made his first solo flight in a military aircraft. During advanced training at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Corpus%20Christi">Naval Air Station Corpus Christi</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, he accepted an offer to transfer to the <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a>. Having completed his flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. After advanced training at <a href="Camp%20Kearny">Camp Kearny</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, he was assigned to Marine Squadron <a href="VMJ-353">VMJ-353</a>, which flew <a href="R4D">R4D</a> transport planes from there. Glenn married Annie in a Presbyterian ceremony at College Drive Church in <a href="New%20Concord%2C%20Ohio">New Concord, Ohio</a>, on April 6, 1943.

The <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> squadron <a href="VMO-155">VMO-155</a> was also at Camp Kearny flying the <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a>. Glenn approached the squadron's commander, <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> J. P. Haines, who suggested that he could put in for a transfer. This was approved, and Glenn was posted to VMO-155 on July 2, 1943, two days before the squadron moved to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20El%20Centro">Marine Corps Air Station El Centro</a> in California. The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> in September 1943. He was promoted to <a href="First%20lieutenant%23U.S.%20Army%2C%20U.S.%20Marine%20Corps%20and%20U.S.%20Air%20Force">first lieutenant</a> in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944. VMO-155 became part of the garrison on <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a> on February 21, then moved to the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> in June 1944 and flew 57 combat missions in the area. He received two <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Crosses</a> and ten <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>s.

At the end of his one-year tour of duty in February 1945, Glenn was assigned to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Cherry%20Point">Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point</a> in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, then to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Patuxent%20River">Naval Air Station Patuxent River</a> in Maryland. He was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a> in July 1945 and ordered back to Cherry Point. There, he joined <a href="VMF-913">VMF-913</a>, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission. In March 1946, he was assigned to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20El%20Toro">Marine Corps Air Station El Toro</a> in southern California. He volunteered for service with the <a href="Operation%20Beleaguer">occupation in North China</a>, believing that it would be a short tour. He joined <a href="VMF-218">VMF-218</a> (another Corsair squadron), which was based at <a href="Beijing%20Nanyuan%20Airport">Nanyuan Field</a> near <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>, in December 1946, and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to <a href="Guam">Guam</a> in March 1947.

In December 1948, Glenn was re-posted to NAS Corpus Christi as a student at the Naval School of All-Weather Flight before becoming a <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a>. In July 1951, he was sent to the <a href="Amphibious%20Warfare%20School">Amphibious Warfare School</a> at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Quantico">Marine Corps Base Quantico</a> in northern <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> for a six-month course. He then joined the staff of the Commandant of the Marine Corps Schools. Given only four hours of flying time per month, he maintained his proficiency (and flight pay) by flying on weekends. He was promoted to major in July 1952. Glenn received the <a href="World%20War%20II%20Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">World War II Victory Medal</a>, <a href="American%20Campaign%20Medal">American Campaign Medal</a>, <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Campaign%20Medal">Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal</a> (with one <a href="service%20star">star</a>), <a href="Navy%20Occupation%20Service%20Medal">Navy Occupation Service Medal</a> (with Asia clasp), and the <a href="China%20Service%20Medal">China Service Medal</a> for his efforts.

Glenn took a short period of leave during which he moved his family back to New Concord, and after two and a half months of jet training at Cherry Point, was ordered to <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> in October 1952, late in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Before he set out for Korea in February 1953, he applied for an inter-service exchange position with the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> (USAF) to fly the <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a> jet <a href="interceptor%20aircraft">fighter-interceptor</a>. In preparation, he arranged with Colonel Leon W. Gray to check out the F-86 at <a href="Otis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Otis Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Pending this exchange assignment, Glenn reported to <a href="Pohang%20Airport">K-3</a>, an airbase in South Korea, on February 3, 1953, and was assigned to be the operations officer for <a href="VMF-311">VMF-311</a>, one of two Marine fighter squadrons there. VMF-311 was equipped with the <a href="F9F%20Panther">F9F Panther</a> jet <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>. Glenn's first mission was a reconnaissance flight on February 26. He flew 63 combat missions in Korea with VMF-311, and was nicknamed "Magnet Ass" because of the number of <a href="flak">flak</a> hits he took on low-level <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> missions; twice, he returned to base with over 250 holes in his plane. He flew for a time with Marine reservist <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a> (a future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> baseball player with the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>) as his <a href="wingman">wingman</a>, and also flew with future major general <a href="Ralph%20H.%20Spanjer">Ralph H. Spanjer</a>.

In June 1953, Glenn's USAF exchange position came through and he reported for duty with the USAF's <a href="25th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a>, and flew 27 combat missions in the F-86, a much faster aircraft than the F9F Panther, patrolling <a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>. Combat with a <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a>, which was faster and better armed still, was regarded as the apogee for a fighter pilot. On the USAF buses that took the pilots out to the airfields before dawn, pilots who had been shot at by a MiG could sit while those who had not had to stand. Glenn later wrote, "Since the days of the <a href="Lafayette%20Escadrille">Lafayette Escadrille</a> during World War I, pilots have viewed air-to-air combat as the ultimate test not only of their machines but of their own personal determination and flying skills. I was no exception." He hoped to become the second Marine jet <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> after <a href="John%20F.%20Bolt">John F. Bolt</a>. When Glenn complained about there not being any MiGs to shoot at, his USAF squadron mates painted "MiG Mad Marine" on his aircraft. He shot down his first MiG in a <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a> on July 12, 1953, downed a second one on July 19, and a third on July 22 during an aerial engagement in which four Sabres shot down three MiGs. These were the final air victories of the war, which ended with an armistice five days later. For his service in Korea, Glenn received two more Distinguished Flying Crosses and eight more Air Medals. Glenn also received the <a href="Korean%20Service%20Medal">Korean Service Medal</a> (with two campaign stars), <a href="United%20Nations%20Korea%20Medal">United Nations Korea Medal</a>, <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Expeditionary%20Medal">Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal</a>, <a href="National%20Defense%20Service%20Medal">National Defense Service Medal</a> (with one star), and the <a href="Korean%20War%20Service%20Medal">Korean War Service Medal</a>.

With combat experience as a fighter pilot, Glenn applied for training as a <a href="flight%20test">test pilot</a> while still in Korea. He reported to the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Test%20Pilot%20School">U.S. Naval Test Pilot School</a> at <a href="NAS%20Patuxent%20River">NAS Patuxent River</a> in Maryland in January 1954, and graduated in July. At Patuxent River the future <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipient, <a href="James%20Stockdale">James Stockdale</a> tutored him in physics and math. Glenn's first flight test assignment, testing the <a href="North%20American%20FJ-2/-3%20Fury">FJ-3 Fury</a>, nearly killed him when its cockpit depressurized and its oxygen system failed. He also tested the armament of aircraft such as the <a href="Vought%20F7U%20Cutlass">Vought F7U Cutlass</a> and <a href="Vought%20F-8%20Crusader">F8U Crusader</a>. From November 1956 to April 1959, he was assigned to the Fighter Design Branch of the Navy <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and attended the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a>.

On July 16, 1957, he made the first <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> <a href="transcontinental%20flight">transcontinental flight</a>. At that time, the transcontinental speed record, held by an Air Force <a href="Republic%20F-84%20Thunderjet">Republic F-84 Thunderjet</a>, was 3 hours 45 minutes and Glenn calculated that an F8U Crusader could do it faster. Because its air speed was faster than that of a <a href=".45%20ACP">.45 caliber bullet</a>, Glenn called his project "Project Bullet". He flew an F8U Crusader from <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Army%20Airfield">Los Alamitos, California</a> to <a href="Floyd%20Bennett%20Field">Floyd Bennett Field</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 3 hours, 23 minutes and 8.3 seconds, averaging supersonic speed despite three <a href="Aerial%20refueling">in-flight refuelings</a> when speeds dropped below . His on-board camera took the first continuous, transcontinental <a href="Panoramic%20photography">panoramic photograph</a> of the United States. He received his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission, and was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> on April 1, 1959. His cross-country flight made him a minor celebrity. A profile piece appeared in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and he appeared on the television show "<a href="Name%20That%20Tune">Name That Tune</a>". He now had nearly 9,000 hours of flying time, including about 3,000 hours in jets.
On October 4, 1957, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> launched <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik 1</a>, the first artificial <a href="satellite">satellite</a>. This damaged American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>. In response, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> launched the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>. The <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was announced on December 17, 1958. This was <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>, which aimed to launch a man into <a href="Earth%20orbit">Earth orbit</a>, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.

While Glenn was on duty at Patuxent and in Washington, he read everything he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to <a href="Langley%20Air%20Force%20Base">Langley Air Force Base</a> in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed NASA into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also be sent to the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Warfare%20Center%20Warminster">Naval Air Development Center</a> in <a href="Johnsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Johnsville, Pennsylvania</a>, and would be subjected to high <a href="G-force">G-force</a>s in a <a href="centrifuge">centrifuge</a> for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the <a href="mockup">mockup</a> of a spacecraft. As he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the <a href="McDonnell">McDonnell</a> plant in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.

NASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards: the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and be or less. Only the height requirement was strictly enforced, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft. This was fortunate for Glenn, who barely met the requirements, as he was near the age cutoff and lacked a science-based degree. The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group. The first group of 35, which included <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a>, assembled at <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, Admiral <a href="Arleigh%20Burke">Arleigh Burke</a>, and the USAF officers were addressed by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Thomas%20D.%20White">Thomas D. White</a>. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They warned that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.
The briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. As this seemed an adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the <a href="Lovelace%20Respiratory%20Research%20Institute">Lovelace Clinic</a> and the <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory</a>. Only one candidate, <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA <a href="Space%20Task%20Group">Space Task Group</a>, <a href="Robert%20R.%20Gilruth">Robert R. Gilruth</a>, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.

After testing, the astronaut candidates had to wait 10 to 12 days for the results. Glenn had returned to his position at the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics when he received a call from the associate director of Project Mercury, Charles Donlan, offering him a position. The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at <a href="Cutts%E2%80%93Madison%20House">Dolley Madison House</a> in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: <a href="Scott%20Carpenter">Scott Carpenter</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a>, Glenn, <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a>, and <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>. In "The Right Stuff", <a href="Tom%20Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a> wrote that Glenn "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the lone Marine." The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> to watch their first rocket launch, of an <a href="SM-65D%20Atlas">SM-65D Atlas</a>, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it exploded spectacularly, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: "Well, I'm glad they got that out of the way."

Glenn remained an officer in the Marine Corps after his selection, and was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a> in <a href="Hampton%2C%20Virginia">Hampton, Virginia</a>. The task force moved to <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston, Texas</a>, in 1962, and became part of the NASA <a href="Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a>. A portion of the astronauts' training was in the classroom, where they learned space science. The group also received hands-on training, which included <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialization was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>s. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a>, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.

Glenn was the backup pilot for Shepard and Grissom on the first two manned Project Mercury flights, the sub-orbital missions <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">Mercury-Redstone 3</a> and <a href="Mercury-Redstone%204">Mercury-Redstone 4</a>. Glenn was selected for <a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Mercury-Atlas 6</a>, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft "Freedom 7" and "Liberty Bell 7". The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, "Friendship 7", and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hangar and altitude tests, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.

After a long series of delays, "Friendship 7" lifted off from <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station">Cape Canaveral Air Force Station</a> on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the countdown due to equipment malfunctions and improvements and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the <a href="ablative%20heat%20shield">heat shield</a> had loosened. If this reading had been accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would have burned up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion on how to deal with this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. The retrorocket pack broke up into large chunks of flaming debris which flew past the window of his capsule during re-entry; Glenn thought this might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldn't be answering these questions." After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose; the sensor was faulty.
"Friendship 7" safely <a href="Splashdown">splashed down</a> southeast of Cape Canaveral after Glenn's 4-hour, 55-minute flight. He carried a note on the flight which read, "I am a stranger. I come in peace. Take me to your leader and there will be a massive reward for you in eternity" in several languages, in case he landed near southern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> islands. The original procedure called for Glenn to exit through the top hatch, but he was uncomfortably warm and decided that egress through the side hatch would be faster. During the flight, he endured 7.8 G of acceleration and traveled at about . The flight took Glenn to a maximum altitude (apogee) of about and a minimum altitude of (perigee). The flight made Glenn the first American to <a href="orbit">orbit</a> the Earth, the third American in space, and the fifth human in space. The mission, which Glenn called "best day of his life", renewed U.S. confidence. His flight occurred while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were embroiled in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and competing in the Space Race.

As the first American in orbit, Glenn became a national hero, met President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, and received a <a href="ticker-tape%20parade">ticker-tape parade</a> in New York reminiscent of those honoring <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> and other heroes. He became "so valuable to the nation as an iconic figure", according to NASA administrator <a href="Charles%20Bolden">Charles Bolden</a>, that Kennedy would not "risk putting him back in space again." Glenn's fame and political potential were noted by the Kennedys, and he became a friend of the <a href="Kennedy%20family">Kennedy family</a>. On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy gave him the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">NASA Distinguished Service Medal</a> for his "Friendship 7" flight. Upon receiving the award, Glenn said, "I would like to consider I was a figurehead for this whole big, tremendous effort, and I am very proud of the medal I have on my lapel." Glenn also received his sixth Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts. He was among the first group of astronauts to be awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a>. The award was presented to him by President Jimmy Carter in 1978. After his 1962 spaceflight, NASA proposed giving Glenn the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, but Glenn did not think that would be appropriate. His military and space awards were stolen from his home in 1978, and he remarked that he would keep this medal in a safe.

In 1962, NASA contemplated recruiting women to the astronaut corps, but Glenn gave a speech before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Science%2C%20Space%20and%20Technology">House Space Committee</a> detailing his opposition to sending women into space, in which he said: 

NASA had no official policy prohibiting women, but the requirement that astronauts had to be test pilots effectively excluded them. NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, none as pilots. In June 1963, the Soviet Union launched a female cosmonaut, <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a> into orbit. After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality flew in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut <a href="Svetlana%20Savitskaya">Svetlana Savitskaya</a>. During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> <a href="Mission%20Specialist">Mission Specialist</a> <a href="Judith%20Resnik">Judith Resnik</a> in her career.

At 42, Glenn was the oldest member of the astronaut corps and would likely be close to 50 by the time the lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Attorney General</a> <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> for <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Ohio">Ohio</a> in 1964, challenging aging incumbent <a href="Stephen%20M.%20Young">Stephen M. Young</a> (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. As it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for <a href="Project%20Apollo">Project Apollo</a> missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> candidacy for the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> from his home state of Ohio the following day. Glenn was still a Marine, and had plenty of unused leave time. He elected to use it while he waited for his retirement papers to go through.

In late February he was hospitalized for a <a href="concussion">concussion</a> sustained in a fall against a bathtub while attempting to fix a mirror in a hotel room; an inner-ear injury from the accident left him unable to campaign. He withdrew from the race on March 30. Both his wife and Scott Carpenter campaigned on his behalf during February and March, but doctors gave Glenn a recovery time of one year. Glenn did not want to win solely due to his astronaut fame, so he dropped out of the race on March 30.

Glenn was still on leave from the Marine Corps, and he withdrew his papers to retire so he could keep a salary and health benefits. Glenn was on the list of potential candidates to be promoted to full colonel, but he notified the <a href="Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a> of his intention to retire so that another Marine could receive the promotion. President Johnson later decided to promote Glenn to full colonel status, without taking someone else's spot. He retired as a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> on January 1, 1965. Glenn was approached by <a href="RC%20Cola">RC Cola</a> to join their public relations department, but Glenn declined it because he wanted to be involved with a business, and not just the face of it. The company revised their offer, and offered Glenn a vice president of corporate development position, as well as a place on the board of directors. The company later expanded Glenn's role, promoting him to president of Royal Crown International. A Senate seat was open in 1968, and Glenn was asked about his current political aspirations. He said he had no current plan, and "Let's talk about it one of these days." Glenn also said that a 1970 Senate run was a possibility.

In 1973, he and a friend bought a <a href="Holiday%20Inn">Holiday Inn</a> near <a href="Disney%20World">Disney World</a>. The success of Disney World expanded to their business, and the pair built three more hotels. One of Glenn's business partners was <a href="Henri%20Landwirth">Henri Landwirth</a>, a <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor who became his best friend. He remembered learning about Landwirth's background: "Henri doesn't talk about it much. It was years before he spoke about it with me and then only because of an accident. We were down in Florida during the space program. Everyone was wearing short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirtseveryone but Henri. Then one day I saw Henri at the pool and noticed the number on his arm. I told Henri that if it were me I'd wear that number like a medal with a spotlight on it."

Glenn remained close to the Kennedy family, and campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy during his <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201968">1968 presidential campaign</a>. In 1968, Glenn was in Kennedy's hotel suite when Kennedy heard he had won California. Glenn was supposed to go with him to celebrate, but decided not to as there would be many people there. Kennedy went downstairs to make his victory speech and was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">assassinated</a>. Glenn and Annie went with them to the hospital, and the next morning took Kennedy's children home to Virginia. Glenn was later a pallbearer at the funeral in New York.

In 1970, Young did not seek reelection and the seat was open. Businessman <a href="Howard%20Metzenbaum">Howard Metzenbaum</a>, Young's former campaign manager, was backed by the <a href="Ohio%20Democratic%20party">Ohio Democratic party</a> and major labor unions, which provided him a significant funding advantage over Glenn. Glenn's camp persuaded him to be thrifty during the primary so he could save money for the general election. By the end of the primary campaign, Metzenbaum was spending four times as much as Glenn. Glenn was defeated in the Democratic primary by Metzenbaum (who received 51 percent of the vote to Glenn's 49 percent). Some prominent Democrats said Glenn was a "hapless political rube", and one newspaper called him "the ultimate square".

Metzenbaum lost the general election to <a href="Robert%20Taft%20Jr.">Robert Taft Jr.</a> Glenn remained active in the political scene following his defeat. <a href="John%20J.%20Gilligan">John J. Gilligan</a>, the Ohio Governor at the time, appointed Glenn to be the chairman of the Citizens Task Force on Environmental Protection in 1970. The task force was created to survey environmental problems in the state and released a report in 1971 detailing the issues. The meetings and the final report of the task force were major contributors to the formation of Ohio's <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>.

In 1973, President Nixon ordered <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Elliot%20Richardson">Elliot Richardson</a> to fire <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> special prosecutor <a href="Archibald%20Cox">Archibald Cox</a>. Richardson refused and resigned in protest, triggering the <a href="Saturday%20Night%20Massacre">Saturday Night Massacre</a>. Ohio Senator <a href="William%20Saxbe">William Saxbe</a>, elected in 1968, was appointed Attorney General. Both Glenn and Metzenbaum sought the vacated seat, which was to be filled by Governor <a href="John%20J.%20Gilligan">John Gilligan</a>. Gilligan was planning on a presidential or vice-presidential run in the near future, and offered Glenn the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Ohio">lieutenant governor</a> position, with the thought that Glenn would ascend to governor when Gilligan was elected to a higher position. The Ohio Democratic party backed this solution to avoid what was expected to be a divisive primary battle between Metzenbaum and Glenn. He declined, denouncing their attempts as "bossism" and "blackmail". Glenn's counteroffer suggested that Gilligan fill the position with someone other than Metzenbaum or Glenn so neither would have an advantage going into the 1974 election. Metzenbaum's campaign agreed to back Gilligan in his governor re-election campaign, and Metzenbaum was subsequently appointed in January 1974 to the vacated seat. At the end of Saxbe's term, Glenn challenged Metzenbaum in the primary for the Ohio Senate seat.

Glenn's campaign changed their strategy after the 1970 election. In 1970, Glenn won most of the counties in Ohio but lost in those with larger populations. The campaign changed its focus, and worked primarily in the large counties. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply became known as the "<a href="American%20Gold%20Star%20Mothers">Gold Star Mothers</a>" speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating <a href="Ralph%20Perk">Ralph Perk</a> (the Republican <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Cleveland">mayor of Cleveland</a>) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999.

In the <a href="1976%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">1976 presidential election</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Glenn was reported to be in consideration for the vice-presidential nomination because he was a senator in a pivotal state and for his fame and straightforwardness. Some thought he was too much like Carter, partially because they both had military backgrounds, and that he did not have enough experience to become president. <a href="Barbara%20Jordan">Barbara Jordan</a> was the first keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention. Her speech electrified the crowd, and was filled with applause and standing ovations. Glenn's keynote address immediately followed Jordan's, and he failed to impress the delegates. Walter Cronkite described it as "dull", and other delegates complained that he was hard to hear. Carter called Glenn to inform him the nomination was going to another candidate, and later nominated the veteran politician <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>. It was also reported that Carter's wife thought Annie Glenn, who had a stutter, would hurt the campaign.

In his first reelection campaign, Glenn ran opposed in the primary for the 1980 Senate election. His opponents, engineer Francis Hunstiger and ex-teacher Frances Waterman, were not well-known and poorly funded. His opponents only spent a few thousand dollars on the campaign, while Glenn spent $700,000. Reporters noted that for a race he was likely to win, Glenn was spending a lot of time and money on the campaign. His chief strategist responded to the remarks saying, "It's the way he does things. He takes nothing for granted." Glenn won the primary by a landslide, with 934,230 of the 1.09 million votes.

<a href="Jim%20Betts%20%28politician%29">Jim Betts</a>, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary, challenged Glenn for his seat. Betts publicly stated that Glenn's policies were part of the reason for inflation increases and a lower standard of living. Betts' campaign also attacked Glenn's voting record, saying that he often voted for spending increases. Glenn's campaign's response was that he has been a part of over 3,000 roll calls and "any one of them could be taken out of context". Glenn was projected to win the race easily, and won by the largest margin ever for an Ohio Senator, defeating Betts by over 40 percent.

Glenn was unhappy with how divided the country was, and thought labels like conservative and liberal increased the divide. He considered himself a centrist. Glenn thought a more centrist president would help unite the country. Glenn believed his experience as a senator from Ohio was ideal, due to the state's diversity. Glenn thought that <a href="Teddy%20Kennedy">Teddy Kennedy</a> could win the election, but after Kennedy's announcement in late 1982 that he would not seek the presidency, Glenn thought he had a much better chance of winning. He hired a media consultant to help him with his speaking style.

Glenn announced his <a href="1984%20Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20primaries">candidacy for president</a> on April 21, 1983 in the <a href="John%20Glenn%20High%20School%20%28New%20Concord%2C%20Ohio%29">John Glenn High School</a> gymnasium. He started out the campaign out-raising the front-runner, Mondale. He also polled the highest of any Democrat against Reagan. During the fall of 1983, "<a href="The%20Right%20Stuff%20%28film%29">The Right Stuff</a>", a film about the Mercury Seven astronauts, was released. Reviewers saw <a href="Ed%20Harris">Ed Harris</a>' portrayal of Glenn as heroic and his staff began to publicize the film to the press. One reviewer said that "Harris’ depiction helped transform Glenn from a history-book figure into a likable, thoroughly adoration-worthy Hollywood hero," turning him into a big-screen icon. Others considered the movie to be damaging to Glenn's campaign, serving as only a reminder that Glenn's most significant achievement occurred decades earlier. Glenn's autobiography said the film "had a chilling effect on the campaign."

Glenn's campaign decided to forgo the traditional campaigning in early caucuses and primaries, and focus on building campaign offices across the country. He opened offices in 43 states by January 1984. Glenn's campaign spent a significant amount of money on television advertising in Iowa, and Glenn chose not to attend an Iowan debate on farm issues. He finished fifth in the Iowa caucus, and went on to lose New Hampshire. Glenn's campaign continued into <a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a>, and he lost there as well. He announced his withdrawal from the race on March 16, 1984. After Mondale defeated him for the nomination, Glenn carried $3 million in campaign debt for over 20 years before receiving a reprieve from the <a href="Federal%20Election%20Commission">Federal Election Commission</a>.

Glenn's Senate seat was challenged by <a href="Thomas%20Kindness">Thomas Kindness</a>. Kindness was unopposed in his primary, while Glenn faced <a href="Lyndon%20LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> supporter Don Scott. LaRouche supporters had been recently elected in Illinois, but the Ohio Democratic Party chairman did not think it was likely they would see the same success in Ohio. LaRouche was known for his fringe theories, such as the queen of England being a drug dealer. Kindness spoke to his supporters and warned them against LaRouche candidates. He issued a statement telling voters to reject LaRouche candidates in both Republican and Democrat primaries. Glenn won the primary contest with 88% of the vote.

With the primary complete, Glenn began his campaign against Kindness. Glenn believed he and other Democrats were the targets of a negative campaign thought up by the GOP strategists in Washington. Kindness focused on Glenn's campaign debts for his failed presidential run, and the fact he stopped payments on it while campaigning for the Senate seat. After winning the race with 62% of the vote, Glenn remarked, "We proved that in 1986, they couldn't kill Glenn with Kindness."

In 1992, Republican <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a> won the Republican primary and challenged Glenn in the Senate election. Glenn ran unopposed in the primary. DeWine's campaign focused on the need for change and for term limits for Senators. This would be Glenn's fourth term as senator. DeWine also criticized Glenn's campaign debts, using a bunny dressed as an astronaut beating a drum, with an announcer saying, "He just keeps owing and owing and owing", a play on the <a href="Energizer%20Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a>. During a debate, Glenn asked DeWine to stop his negative campaign ads, saying "This has been the most negative campaign". DeWine responded that he would if Glenn would disclose how he spent the money he received from <a href="Charles%20Keating">Charles Keating</a>, fallout from Glenn being named one of the <a href="Keating%20Five">Keating Five</a>. Glenn won the Senate seat, with 2.4 million votes to DeWine's 2 million votes. It was DeWine's first-ever campaign loss. DeWine later worked on the intelligence committee with Glenn and watched his second launch into space.

Glenn requested to be assigned to two committees during his first year as senator: the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Governmental%20Affairs">Government Operations Committee</a> (later known as the Committee on Governmental Affairs), and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Foreign Relations Committee</a>. He was immediately assigned to the Government Operations Committee, and waited for a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. In 1977, Glenn wanted to chair the Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee. <a href="Abraham%20Ribicoff">Abraham Ribicoff</a>, chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said he could chair the subcommittee if he also chaired the less popular <a href="Federal%20Services%20Subcommittee">Federal Services Subcommittee</a>, which was in charge of the <a href="U.S.%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a>. Previous chairs of the Federal Services Subcommittee lost elections due in part to negative campaigns that tied in the poorly regarded mail service with the chairmen, but Glenn accepted the offer and became the chair of both subcommittees. One of his goals as a new senator was developing environmental policies. Glenn introduced bills on energy policy to try to counter the <a href="1970s%20energy%20crisis">energy crisis in the 70s</a>. Glenn also introduced legislation promoting nuclear non-proliferation, and was the chief author of the <a href="Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Act%20of%201978">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978</a>, the first of six major pieces of legislation that he produced on the subject.

Glenn chaired the Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It was in this role that he discovered safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was made aware of the problem at the <a href="Fernald%20Feed%20Materials%20Production%20Center">Fernald Feed Materials Production Center</a> near Cincinnati, and soon found that it affected sites across the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He also released a report on the potential costs of hazardous waste cleanup at former nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities, known as the Glenn Report. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the <a href="nuclear%20waste">nuclear waste</a> left at the facilities.

Glenn also focused on reducing government waste. He created legislation to mandate <a href="CFO">CFO</a>s for large governmental agencies. Glenn wrote a bill to add the office of the Inspector General to federal agencies, to help find waste and fraud. He also created legislation intended to prevent the federal government from imposing regulations on local governments without funding. Glenn founded the Great Lakes Task Force, which helped protect the environment of the Great Lakes.

In 1995 Glenn became the ranking minority member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Glenn disputed the focus of <a href="1996%20United%20States%20campaign%20finance%20controversy">illegal Chinese donations</a> to the Democrats, and asserted that Republicans also had egregious fundraising issues. The committee chair, <a href="Fred%20Thompson">Fred Thompson</a> of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, disagreed and continued the investigation. Thompson and Glenn continued to work together poorly for the duration of the investigation. Thompson would only give Glenn information he was legally required to. Glenn would not authorize a larger budget and tried to expand the scope of the investigation to include members of the GOP. The investigation concluded with a Republican-written report, which Thompson described as, "...a lot of things strung together that paint a real ugly picture." The Democrats, led by Glenn, said the report "...does not support the conclusion that the China plan was aimed at, or affected, the 1996 presidential election."

Glenn was the vice chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Homeland%20Security%20Permanent%20Subcommittee%20on%20Investigations">Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</a>, a subcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. When the Republican Party regained control of the Senate in 1996, Glenn became the ranking minority member on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations until he was succeeded by <a href="Carl%20Levin">Carl Levin</a>. During this time, the committee investigated issue such as fraud on the Internet, mortgage fraud, and day trading of securities.

Glenn's father spent his retirement money battling cancer, and would have lost his house if Glenn had not intervened. His father-in-law also had expensive treatments for Parkinson's disease. These health and financial issues motivated him to request a seat on the <a href="U.S.%20Senate%20Special%20Committee%20on%20Aging">Special Committee on Aging</a>.

Glenn was considered an expert in matters of science and technology due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the <a href="Rockwell%20B-1%20Lancer">B-1 bomber</a> program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carter's desire to fund the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-2%20Spirit">B-2 bomber</a> program. Glenn did not fully support development of the B-2 because he had doubts about the feasibility of the <a href="stealth%20technology">stealth technology</a>. He drafted a proposal to slow down the development of the B-2, which could have potentially saved money, but the measure was rejected.

Glenn joined the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Foreign Relations Committee</a> in 1978. He became the chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, for which he traveled to Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. Glenn helped to pass the <a href="Taiwan%20Relations%20Act">Taiwan Enabling Act</a> of 1979. The same year, Glenn's stance on the <a href="Strategic%20Arms%20Limitation%20Talks">SALT II treaty</a> caused another dispute with President Carter. Due to the loss of radar listening posts in Iran, Glenn did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty. During the launching ceremony for the , he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance. First Lady <a href="Rosalynn%20Carter">Rosalynn Carter</a> also spoke at the event, during which she criticized Glenn for speaking publicly about the issue. The Senate never ratified the treaty, in part because of the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>. Glenn served on the committee until 1985, when he traded it for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Armed Services Committee</a>.
Glenn became chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Subcommittee%20on%20Personnel">Manpower Subcommittee</a> of the Armed Services Committee in 1987. He introduced legislation such as increasing pay and benefits for American troops in the Persian Gulf during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. He served as chairman until 1993, becoming chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Subcommittee%20on%20Readiness%20and%20Management%20Support">Military Readiness and Defense Infrastructure</a>.

Glenn was one of the <a href="Keating%20Five">Keating Five</a>the U.S. Senators involved with the <a href="savings%20and%20loan%20crisis">savings and loan crisis</a>after Glenn accepted a $200,000 campaign contribution from <a href="Lincoln%20Savings%20and%20Loan%20Association">Lincoln Savings and Loan Association</a> head Charles Keating. During the crisis, the Senators were accused of delaying the seizure of Keating's S&L, which cost taxpayers an additional $2 billion. The combination of perceived political pressure and Keating's monetary contributions to the senators led to an investigation.

The Ethic Committee's outside counsel, Robert Bennett, wanted to eliminate Republican Senator <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> and Glenn from the investigation. The Democrats did not want to exclude McCain, as he was the only Republican being investigated, which means they could not excuse Glenn from the investigation either. McCain and Glenn were reprimanded the least of the five, as the Senate commission found that they had exercised "poor judgment". The GOP focused on Glenn's "poor judgement" rather than what Glenn saw as complete exoneration. GOP chairman <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bennett">Robert Bennett</a> said, "John Glenn misjudged Charles Keating. He also misjudged the tolerance of Ohio's taxpayers, who are left to foot the bill of nearly $2 billion." After the Senate's report, Glenn said, "They so firmly put this thing to bed...there isn't much there to fuss with. I didn't do anything wrong." In his autobiography, Glenn wrote, "outside of people close to me dying, these hearings were the low point of my life." The case cost him $520,000 in legal fees. The association of his name with the scandal made Republicans hopeful that he could be defeated in the 1992 campaign, but Glenn defeated Lieutenant Governor Mike DeWine to retain his seat.

On February 20, 1997, which was the 35th anniversary of his Friendship 7 flight, Glenn announced that his retirement from the Senate would occur at the end of his term in January 1999. Glenn retired due to his age, saying "...there is still no cure for the common birthday".

In 1995, Glenn was reading "Space Physiology and Medicine", a book written by NASA doctors. He realized that many changes that occur to physical attributes during space flight, such as loss of bone and muscle mass and blood plasma, are the same as changes that occur due to aging. Glenn thought NASA should send an older person on a shuttle mission, and thought that it should be him. Starting in 1995, he began lobbying NASA director Dan Goldin for the mission. Goldin said he would consider it if there was a scientific reason, and if Glenn could pass the same physical examination the younger astronauts took. Glenn performed research on the subject, and passed the physical examination. On January 16, 1998, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin announced that Glenn would be part of the <a href="STS-95">STS-95</a> crew; this made him, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space.

NASA and the National Institute of Aging (NIA) planned to use Glenn as a test subject for research, with <a href="biometrics">biometrics</a> taken before, during and after his flight. Some experiments (in <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian rhythm</a>s, for example) compared him with the younger crew members. In addition to these tests, he was in charge of the flight's photography and videography. Glenn returned to space on the Space Shuttle on October 29, 1998, as a <a href="payload%20specialist">payload specialist</a> on <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery">Space Shuttle "Discovery"</a>. Shortly before the flight, researchers disqualified Glenn from one of the flight's two major human experiments (on the effect of <a href="melatonin">melatonin</a>) due to undisclosed medical reasons; he participated in experiments on sleep monitoring and protein use. On November 6, President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> sent a congratulatory email to Glenn aboard the "Discovery". This is often cited as the first email sent by a sitting US President, but records exist of emails being sent by President Clinton several years earlier.
His participation in the nine-day mission was criticized by some members of the space community as a favor granted by Clinton; John Pike, director of the <a href="Federation%20of%20American%20Scientists">Federation of American Scientists</a>' space-policy project, said: "If he was a normal person, he would acknowledge he's a great American hero and that he should get to fly on the shuttle for free ... He's too modest for that, and so he's got to have this medical research reason. It's got nothing to do with medicine".

In a 2012 interview, Glenn said he regretted that NASA did not continue its research on aging by sending additional elderly people into space. After STS-95 returned safely, its crew received a ticker-tape parade. On October 15, 1998, <a href="Texas%20State%20Highway%20NASA%20Road%201">NASA Road 1</a> (the main route to the Johnson Space Center) was temporarily renamed John Glenn Parkway for several months. Glenn was awarded the <a href="NASA%20Space%20Flight%20Medal">NASA Space Flight Medal</a> in 1998 for flying on STS-95. In 2001, Glenn opposed sending <a href="Dennis%20Tito">Dennis Tito</a>, the world's first <a href="Space%20tourism">space tourist</a>, to the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> because Tito's trip had no scientific purpose.

Glenn and Annie had two children—John David and Carolyn Ann—and two grandchildren, and remained married for 73 years until his death.
A <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, Glenn was a member of Concord Lodge #688 in New Concord, Ohio. He received all of his <a href="Masonic%20ritual%20and%20symbolism">degrees</a> in full in a <a href="Mason%20at%20Sight">Mason at Sight</a> ceremony from the <a href="Grand%20Master%20%28Masonic%29">Grand Master</a> of Ohio in 1978, 14 years after petitioning his lodge. In 1999, Glenn became a 33rd-degree <a href="Scottish%20Rite">Scottish Rite</a> Mason in the Valley of Cincinnati (<a href="Supreme%20Council%2C%20Scottish%20Rite%2C%20Northern%20Jurisdiction%2C%20USA">NMJ</a>). As an adult, he was honored as part of the DeMolay Legion of Honor by <a href="DeMolay%20International">DeMolay International</a>, a Masonic youth organization for boys.

Glenn was an ordained elder of the <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20%28USA%29">Presbyterian Church</a>. His religious faith began before he became an astronaut, and was reinforced after he traveled in space. "To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible," said Glenn after his second (and final) space voyage. He saw no contradiction between belief in God and the knowledge that evolution is "a fact" and believed evolution should be taught in schools: "I don't see that I'm any less religious that I can appreciate the fact that science just records that we change with evolution and time, and that's a fact. It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater than any of us that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on."

Glenn was an honorary member of the <a href="International%20Academy%20of%20Astronautics">International Academy of Astronautics</a> and a member of the <a href="Society%20of%20Experimental%20Test%20Pilots">Society of Experimental Test Pilots</a>, Marine Corps Aviation Association, <a href="Order%20of%20Daedalians">Order of Daedalians</a>, National Space Club Board of Trustees, National Space Society Board of Governors, International Association of Holiday Inns, <a href="Ohio%20Democratic%20Party">Ohio Democratic Party</a>, State Democratic Executive Committee, Franklin County (Ohio) Democratic Party and the 10th District (Ohio) Democratic Action Club. In 2001 he guest-starred as himself on the American television sitcom "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>".

On September 5, 2009, John and Annie Glenn dotted the "i" in Ohio State University's <a href="Script%20Ohio%23Script%20Ohio">Script Ohio</a> <a href="The%20Ohio%20State%20University%20Marching%20Band">marching band</a> performance during the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football">Ohio State</a>–<a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">Navy</a> football-game halftime show, which is normally reserved for veteran band members. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the "Friendship 7" flight on February 20, 2012, he had an unexpected opportunity to speak with the <a href="Expedition%2030">orbiting crew</a> of the International Space Station when he was onstage with <a href="NASA%20Administrator">NASA Administrator</a> <a href="Charlie%20Bolden">Charlie Bolden</a> at Ohio State University. On April 19, 2012, Glenn participated in the ceremonial transfer of the retired Space Shuttle "Discovery" from NASA to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> for permanent display at the <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a>. He used the occasion to criticize the "unfortunate" decision to end the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle program</a>, saying that grounding the shuttles delayed research.

Glenn was in good health for most of his life. He retained a private pilot's license well into his 80s, eventually quitting flying when he and his wife found it too difficult to get into the cockpit due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful <a href="heart%20valve%20replacement">heart valve replacement</a> surgery at the <a href="Cleveland%20Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a>. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at <a href="the%20James%20Cancer%20Hospital">the James Cancer Hospital</a> of <a href="Ohio%20State%20University%20Wexner%20Medical%20Center">Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center</a> in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.
Glenn died on December 8, 2016, at the OSU Wexner Medical Center; he was 95 years old. No cause of death was disclosed. After his death, his body lay in state at the <a href="Ohio%20Statehouse">Ohio Statehouse</a>. There was a memorial service at Mershon Auditorium at Ohio State University. Another memorial service was performed at Kennedy Space Center near the Heroes and Legends building. His body was interred at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> on April 6, 2017. At the time of his death, John Glenn was the last surviving member of the <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a>.

The "<a href="Military%20Times">Military Times</a>" reported that William Zwicharowski, a senior mortuary official at <a href="Dover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dover Air Force Base</a>, had offered to let visiting inspectors view Glenn's remains, sparking an official investigation. Zwicharowski has denied the remains were disrespected. At the conclusion of the investigation, officials said the remains were not disrespected as inspectors did not accept Zwicharowski's offer, and that Zwicharowski's actions were improper. No administrative action was taken as he had retired.

President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> said that John Glenn, "the first American to orbit the Earth, reminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there's no limit to the heights we can reach together". Tributes were also paid by <a href="President-elect">President-elect</a> <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, and former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>.

The phrase "Godspeed, John Glenn", which fellow Mercury astronaut Scott Carpenter used to hail Glenn's launch into space, became his social-media <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a>: #GodspeedJohnGlenn. Former and current astronauts added tributes; so did NASA Administrator and former shuttle astronaut Charles Bolden, who wrote: "John Glenn's legacy is one of risk and accomplishment, of history created and duty to country carried out under great pressure with the whole world watching." President Obama ordered flags to be flown at <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a> until Glenn's burial. On April 5, 2017, President Donald Trump issued <a href="presidential%20proclamation">presidential proclamation</a> , titled "Honoring the Memory of John Glenn".

Glenn was awarded the <a href="John%20J.%20Montgomery%20Award">John J. Montgomery Award</a> in 1963. Glenn received <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>'s <a href="Hubbard%20Medal">Hubbard Medal</a> in 1962. Glenn, along with 37 other space race astronauts, received the Ambassador of Space Exploration Award in 2006. He was also awarded the General <a href="Thomas%20D.%20White">Thomas D. White</a> National Defense Award, and the <a href="Princess%20of%20Asturias%20Awards%23International%20Cooperation%20%28Cooperaci%C3%B3n%20Internacional%29">Prince of Asturias Award</a> for International Cooperation. In 2004, he received the <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20Awards">Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service</a> from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution, and was awarded the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>'s <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20Award">Theodore Roosevelt Award</a> for 2008.

Glenn earned the <a href="United%20States%20Astronaut%20Badge">Navy's astronaut wings</a> and the Marine Corps' Astronaut Medal. He was awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> in 2011 and was among the first group of astronauts to be granted the distinction. In 2012, President Barack Obama presented Glenn with the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>. Glenn was the seventh astronaut to receive this distinction. The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are considered the two most prestigious awards that can be bestowed on a civilian. The Society of Experimental Test Pilots awarded Glenn the <a href="Iven%20C.%20Kincheloe">Iven C. Kincheloe</a> award in 1963, and he was inducted into the <a href="International%20Air%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Air & Space Hall of Fame</a> in 1968, <a href="National%20Aviation%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Aviation Hall of Fame</a> in 1976, the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Space%20History">International Space Hall of Fame</a> in 1977, and the <a href="U.S.%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame</a> in 1990. In 2000, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for public service by an elected or appointed official, one of the annual <a href="Jefferson%20Awards%20for%20Public%20Service">Jefferson Awards</a>.

In 1961, Glenn received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="LL.D">LL.D</a> from Muskingum University, the college he attended before joining the military in World War II. He also received honorary doctorates from <a href="Nihon%20University">Nihon University</a> in Tokyo; <a href="Wagner%20College">Wagner College</a> in Staten Island, New York; <a href="Ohio%20Northern%20University">Ohio Northern University</a>; <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a>; and <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a>. In 1998 he helped found the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> to encourage public service. The institute merged with OSU's School of Public Policy and Management to become the John Glenn School of Public Affairs. He held an <a href="Professors%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Adjunct%20professor">adjunct professorship</a> at the school. In February 2015, it was announced that it would become the <a href="John%20Glenn%20College%20of%20Public%20Affairs">John Glenn College of Public Affairs</a> in April.

The <a href="Glenn%20Research%20Center">Glenn Research Center</a> at Lewis Field in Cleveland is named after him, and the Senator John Glenn Highway runs along a stretch of <a href="Interstate%20480%20%28Ohio%29">I-480</a> in Ohio across from the Glenn Research Center. Colonel Glenn Highway (which passes Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and <a href="Wright%20State%20University">Wright State University</a> near <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>), John Glenn High School in his hometown of New Concord, and the former Col. John Glenn Elementary in <a href="Seven%20Hills%2C%20Ohio">Seven Hills, Ohio</a>, were also named for him. Colonel Glenn Road in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a> was named for him in 1962. High schools in <a href="Westland%2C%20Michigan">Westland</a> and <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City, Michigan</a>; <a href="Walkerton%2C%20Indiana">Walkerton, Indiana</a>; <a href="San%20Angelo%2C%20Texas">San Angelo, Texas</a>, and <a href="Norwalk%2C%20California">Norwalk, California</a> bear Glenn's name. The fireboat <a href="Fireboat%20John%20H.%20Glenn%20Jr.">"John H. Glenn Jr."</a>, operated by the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20Fire%20and%20Emergency%20Medical%20Services%20Department">District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department</a> and protecting sections of the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac</a> and <a href="Anacostia%20River">Anacostia River</a>s which run through Washington, D.C., was named for him, as was <a href="USNS%20John%20Glenn%20%28T-MLP-2%29">USNS "John Glenn" (T-MLP-2)</a>, a <a href="Expeditionary%20Transfer%20Dock">mobile landing platform</a> delivered to the U.S. Navy on March 12, 2014. In June 2016, the Port Columbus, Ohio, airport was renamed <a href="John%20Glenn%20Columbus%20International%20Airport">John Glenn Columbus International Airport</a>. Glenn and his family attended the ceremony, during which he spoke about how visiting the airport as a child had kindled his interest in flying. On September 12, 2016, <a href="Blue%20Origin">Blue Origin</a> announced the <a href="New%20Glenn">New Glenn</a>, a rocket. <a href="Orbital%20ATK">Orbital ATK</a> named the <a href="Orbital%20Sciences%20Cygnus">Cygnus</a> space capsule used in the NASA <a href="Cygnus%20CRS%20OA-7">CRS OA-7</a> mission to the international space station "S.S. "John Glenn"" in his honor. The mission successfully lifted off on April 16, 2017.

Glenn's public life and legacy began when he received his first ticker tape parade for breaking the transcontinental airspeed record. As a senator, he used his military background to write legislation to reduce nuclear proliferation. He also focused on reducing government waste. Buzz Aldrin wrote that Glenn's Friendship 7 flight, "...helped to galvanize the country’s will and resolution to surmount significant technical challenges of human spaceflight."

Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of <a href="cognitive%20bias">cognitive bias</a> and a systematic error of <a href="inductive%20reasoning">inductive reasoning</a>. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a <a href="bias">bias</a>ed way. The effect is stronger for <a href="emotion">emotion</a>ally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. Confirmation bias is of particular current interest because of the increasing polarisation between left-wing and right-wing political viewpoints, and the gullible acceptance of the current rapid spread of fake news.

People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain <a href="attitude%20polarization">attitude polarization</a> (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), <a href="%23Persistence%20of%20discredited%20beliefs">belief perseverance</a> (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and <a href="illusory%20correlation">illusory correlation</a> (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

A series of <a href="Experimental%20psychology">psychological experiments</a> in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include <a href="wishful%20thinking">wishful thinking</a> and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists can be prone to confirmation bias.

Confirmation biases contribute to <a href="overconfidence%20effect">overconfidence</a> in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor <a href="decision%20making">decisions</a> due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.

Confirmation bias is also called confirmatory bias. An alternative (perhaps better) name is myside bias. Confirmation bias is a variation of the more general tendency of <a href="apophenia">apophenia</a> - the tendency to mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things.

Confirmation biases are effects in <a href="Information%20processing%20theory">information processing</a>. They differ from what is sometimes called the "<a href="Behavioral%20confirmation">behavioral confirmation effect</a>", commonly known as "<a href="self-fulfilling%20prophecy">self-fulfilling prophecy</a>", in which a person's expectations influence their own behavior, bringing about the expected result.

Some psychologists restrict the term "confirmation bias" to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion. Others apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one's existing beliefs when searching for evidence, interpreting it, or recalling it from memory.

Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with their current <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a>. Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence, they phrase questions to receive an affirmative answer that supports their theory. They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true, rather than what would happen if they were false. For example, someone using yes/no questions to find a number they suspect to be the number 3 might ask, "Is it an <a href="odd%20number">odd number</a>?" People prefer this type of question, called a "positive test", even when a negative test such as "Is it an even number?" would yield exactly the same information. However, this does not mean that people seek tests that guarantee a positive answer. In studies where subjects could select either such pseudo-tests or genuinely diagnostic ones, they favored the genuinely diagnostic.

The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias, since positive tests can be highly informative. However, in combination with other effects, this strategy can confirm existing beliefs or assumptions, independently of whether they are true. In real-world situations, evidence is often complex and mixed. For example, various contradictory ideas about someone could each be supported by concentrating on one aspect of his or her behavior. Thus any search for evidence in favor of a hypothesis is likely to succeed. One illustration of this is the way the phrasing of a question can significantly change the answer. For example, people who are asked, "Are you happy with your social life?" report greater satisfaction than those asked, "Are you "un"happy with your social life?"

Even a small change in a question's wording can affect how people search through available information, and hence the conclusions they reach. This was shown using a fictional child custody case. Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways. Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities: a close relationship with the child but a job that would take them away for long periods of time. When asked, "Which parent should have custody of the child?" the majority of participants chose Parent B, looking mainly for positive attributes. However, when asked, "Which parent should be denied custody of the child?" they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that Parent B should be denied custody, implying that Parent A should have custody.

Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests. In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the <a href="extroversion%20and%20introversion">introversion–extroversion</a> personality dimension on the basis of an interview. They chose the interview questions from a given list. When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert, the participants chose questions that presumed introversion, such as, "What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties?" When the interviewee was described as extroverted, almost all the questions presumed extroversion, such as, "What would you do to liven up a dull party?" These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them. A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from, such as, "Do you shy away from social interactions?" Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions, showing only a weak bias towards positive tests. This pattern, of a main preference for diagnostic tests and a weaker preference for positive tests, has been replicated in other studies.

Personality traits influence and interact with biased search processes. Individuals vary in their abilities to defend their attitudes from external attacks in relation to <a href="selective%20exposure%20theory">selective exposure</a>. <a href="selective%20exposure%20theory">Selective exposure</a> occurs when individuals search for information that is consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their personal beliefs. An experiment examined the extent to which individuals could refute arguments that contradicted their personal beliefs. People with high <a href="confidence">confidence</a> levels more readily seek out contradictory information to their personal position to form an argument. Individuals with low confidence levels do not seek out contradictory information and prefer information that supports their personal position. People generate and evaluate evidence in arguments that are biased towards their own beliefs and opinions. Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals' personal beliefs.

Another experiment gave participants a complex rule-discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer. Objects on the computer screen followed specific laws, which the participants had to figure out. So, participants could "fire" objects across the screen to test their hypotheses. Despite making many attempts over a ten-hour session, none of the participants figured out the rules of the system. They typically attempted to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses, and were reluctant to consider alternatives. Even after seeing objective evidence that refuted their working hypotheses, they frequently continued doing the same tests. Some of the participants were taught proper hypothesis-testing, but these instructions had almost no effect.

Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence. Even if two individuals have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased.

A team at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment, with half in favor and half against it. Each participant read descriptions of two studies: a comparison of <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s with and without the death penalty, and a comparison of murder rates in a state before and after the introduction of the death penalty. After reading a quick description of each study, the participants were asked whether their opinions had changed. Then, they read a more detailed account of each study's procedure and had to rate whether the research was well-conducted and convincing. In fact, the studies were fictional. Half the participants were told that one kind of study supported the <a href="deterrence%20%28psychology%29">deterrent</a> effect and the other undermined it, while for other participants the conclusions were swapped.

The participants, whether supporters or opponents, reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read. Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies, they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided, pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary. Participants described studies supporting their pre-existing view as superior to those that contradicted it, in detailed and specific ways. Writing about a study that seemed to undermine the deterrence effect, a death penalty proponent wrote, "The research didn't cover a long enough period of time," while an opponent's comment on the same study said, "No strong evidence to contradict the researchers has been presented." The results illustrated that people set higher standards of evidence for hypotheses that go against their current expectations. This effect, known as "disconfirmation bias", has been supported by other experiments.

Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 U.S. presidential election</a> and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates. They were shown apparently contradictory pairs of statements, either from Republican candidate <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, Democratic candidate <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> or a politically neutral public figure. They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable. From these three pieces of information, they had to decide whether or not each individual's statements were inconsistent. There were strong differences in these evaluations, with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory.

In this experiment, the participants made their judgments while in a <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) scanner which monitored their brain activity. As participants evaluated contradictory statements by their favored candidate, <a href="emotion">emotion</a>al centers of their brains were aroused. This did not happen with the statements by the other figures. The experimenters inferred that the different responses to the statements were not due to passive reasoning errors. Instead, the participants were actively reducing the <a href="cognitive%20dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> induced by reading about their favored candidate's irrational or <a href="Hypocrisy">hypocritical</a> behavior.

Biases in belief interpretation are persistent, regardless of intelligence level. Participants in an experiment took the <a href="SAT">SAT</a> test (a college admissions test used in the United States) to assess their intelligence levels. They then read information regarding safety concerns for vehicles, and the experimenters manipulated the national origin of the car. American participants provided their opinion if the car should be banned on a six-point scale, where one indicated "definitely yes" and six indicated "definitely no". Participants firstly evaluated if they would allow a dangerous German car on American streets and a dangerous American car on German streets. Participants believed that the dangerous German car on American streets should be banned more quickly than the dangerous American car on German streets. There was no difference among intelligence levels at the rate participants would ban a car.

Biased interpretation is not restricted to emotionally significant topics. In another experiment, participants were told a story about a theft. They had to rate the evidential importance of statements arguing either for or against a particular character being responsible. When they hypothesized that character's guilt, they rated statements supporting that hypothesis as more important than conflicting statements.

People may remember evidence selectively to reinforce their expectations, even if they gather and interpret evidence in a neutral manner. This effect is called "selective recall", "confirmatory memory", or "access-biased memory". Psychological theories differ in their predictions about selective recall. <a href="Schema%20%28psychology%29">Schema theory</a> predicts that information matching prior expectations will be more easily stored and recalled than information that does not match. Some alternative approaches say that surprising information stands out and so is memorable. Predictions from both these theories have been confirmed in different experimental contexts, with no theory winning outright.

In one study, participants read a profile of a woman which described a mix of introverted and extroverted behaviors. They later had to recall examples of her introversion and extroversion. One group was told this was to assess the woman for a job as a librarian, while a second group were told it was for a job in real estate sales. There was a significant difference between what these two groups recalled, with the "librarian" group recalling more examples of introversion and the "sales" groups recalling more extroverted behavior. A selective memory effect has also been shown in experiments that manipulate the desirability of personality types. In one of these, a group of participants were shown evidence that extroverted people are more successful than introverts. Another group were told the opposite. In a subsequent, apparently unrelated study, participants were asked to recall events from their lives in which they had been either introverted or extroverted. Each group of participants provided more memories connecting themselves with the more desirable personality type, and recalled those memories more quickly.

Changes in emotional states can also influence memory recall. Participants rated how they felt when they had first learned that <a href="O.J.%20Simpson">O.J. Simpson</a> had been acquitted of murder charges. They described their emotional reactions and confidence regarding the verdict one week, two months, and one year after the trial. Results indicated that participants' assessments for Simpson's guilt changed over time. The more that participants' opinion of the verdict had changed, the less stable were the participant's memories regarding their initial emotional reactions. When participants recalled their initial emotional reactions two months and a year later, past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals of emotion. People demonstrate sizable myside bias when discussing their opinions on controversial topics. Memory recall and construction of experiences undergo revision in relation to corresponding emotional states.

Myside bias has been shown to influence the accuracy of memory recall. In an experiment, widows and widowers rated the intensity of their experienced grief six months and five years after the deaths of their spouses. Participants noted a higher experience of grief at six months rather than at five years. Yet, when the participants were asked after five years how they had felt six months after the death of their significant other, the intensity of grief participants recalled was highly correlated with their current level of grief. Individuals appear to utilize their current emotional states to analyze how they must have felt when experiencing past events. Emotional memories are reconstructed by current emotional states.

One study showed how selective memory can maintain belief in <a href="extrasensory%20perception">extrasensory perception</a> (ESP). Believers and disbelievers were each shown descriptions of ESP experiments. Half of each group were told that the experimental results supported the existence of ESP, while the others were told they did not. In a subsequent test, participants recalled the material accurately, apart from believers who had read the non-supportive evidence. This group remembered significantly less information and some of them incorrectly remembered the results as supporting ESP.

Myside bias was once believed to be associated with greater intelligence; however, studies have shown that myside bias can be more influenced by ability to rationally think as opposed to level of intelligence. Myside bias can cause an inability to effectively and logically evaluate the opposite side of an argument. Studies have stated that myside bias is an absence of "active open-mindedness", meaning the active search for why an initial idea may be wrong. Typically, myside bias is operationalized in empirical studies as the quantity of evidence used in support of their side in comparison to the opposite side.

A study has found individual differences in myside bias. This study investigates individual differences that are acquired through learning in a cultural context and are mutable. The researcher found important individual difference in argumentation. Studies have suggested that individual differences such as deductive reasoning ability, ability to overcome belief bias, epistemological understanding, and thinking disposition are significant predictors of the reasoning and generating arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals.

A study by Christopher Wolfe and Anne Britt also investigated how participants' views of "what makes a good argument?" can be a source of myside bias that influence the way a person formulates his own arguments. The study investigated individual differences of argumentation schema and asked participants to write essays. The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their preferred side of an argument and were given research instructions that took either a balanced or an unrestricted approach. The balanced-research instructions directed participants to create a "balanced" argument, i.e., that included both pros and cons; the unrestricted-research instructions included nothing on how to create the argument.

Overall, the results revealed that the balanced-research instructions significantly increased the incidence of opposing information in arguments. These data also reveal that personal belief is not a "source" of myside bias; however, that those participants, who believe that a good argument is one that is based on facts, are more likely to exhibit myside bias than other participants. This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron's article—that people's opinions about what makes good thinking can influence how arguments are generated.

Before psychological research on confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed throughout history. Beginning with the Greek historian <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> (c. 460 BC – c. 395 BC), who wrote of misguided treason in "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Peloponnesian%20War">The Peloponnesian War</a>"; "... for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy". Italian poet <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> (1265–1321), noted it in his famous work, the "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>", in which <a href="St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> cautions Dante upon meeting in Paradise, "opinion—hasty—often can incline to the wrong side, and then affection for one's own opinion binds, confines the mind". <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> noticed the same effect in his "<a href="Muqaddimah">Muqaddimah</a>": In the "<a href="Novum%20Organum">Novum Organum</a>", English philosopher and scientist <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> (1561–1626) noted that biased assessment of evidence drove "all superstitions, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments or the like". He wrote:

In the second volume of his "<a href="The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>" (1844), German philosopher <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> observed that "An adopted hypothesis gives us lynx-eyes for everything that confirms it and makes us blind to everything that contradicts it."
In his essay (1897) "<a href="What%20Is%20Art%3F">What Is Art?</a>", Russian novelist <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> wrote: 

The term "confirmation bias" was coined by English psychologist <a href="Peter%20Cathcart%20Wason">Peter Wason</a>. In his initial experiment published in 1960 (which does not mention the term "confirmation bias", he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. At the outset, they were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule. Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.

While the actual rule was simply "any ascending sequence", the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as "the middle number is the average of the first and last". The participants seemed to test only positive examples—triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, "Each number is two greater than its predecessor," they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,19).

Wason accepted <a href="falsificationism">falsificationism</a>, according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it. He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence the term "confirmation bias". Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his <a href="Wason%20selection%20task">selection task</a> experiment. In this task, participants are given partial information about a set of objects, and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a <a href="material%20conditional">conditional rule</a> ("If A, then B") applies. It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule.

A 1987 paper by Joshua Klayman and Young-Won Ha argued that the Wason experiments had not actually demonstrated a bias towards confirmation. Instead, Klayman and Ha interpreted the results in terms of a tendency to make tests that are consistent with the working hypothesis. They called this the "positive test strategy". This strategy is an example of a <a href="heuristics%20in%20judgment%20and%20decision%20making">heuristic</a>: a reasoning shortcut that is imperfect but easy to compute. Klayman and Ha used <a href="Bayesian%20probability">Bayesian probability</a> and <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a> as their standard of hypothesis-testing, rather than the falsificationism used by Wason. According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person's prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative. Klayman and Ha argued that when people think about realistic problems, they are looking for a specific answer with a small initial probability. In this case, positive tests are usually more informative than negative tests. However, in Wason's rule discovery task the answer—three numbers in ascending order—is very broad, so positive tests are unlikely to yield informative answers. Klayman and Ha supported their analysis by citing an experiment that used the labels "DAX" and "MED" in place of "fits the rule" and "doesn't fit the rule". This avoided implying that the aim was to find a low-probability rule. Participants had much more success with this version of the experiment.

In light of this and other critiques, the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification to examine whether people test hypotheses in an informative way, or an uninformative but positive way. The search for "true" confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information.

Confirmation bias is often described as a result of automatic, unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception.

According to <a href="Robert%20MacCoun">Robert MacCoun</a>, most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of both "cold" (cognitive) and "hot" (motivated) mechanisms.

Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people's ability to handle complex tasks, and the shortcuts, called "<a href="heuristics%20in%20judgment%20and%20decision%20making">heuristics</a>", that they use. For example, people may judge the reliability of evidence by using the "<a href="availability%20heuristic">availability heuristic</a>"—i.e., how readily a particular idea comes to mind. It is also possible that people can only focus on one thought at a time, so find it difficult to test alternative hypotheses in parallel. Another heuristic is the positive test strategy identified by Klayman and Ha, in which people test a hypothesis by examining cases where they expect a property or event to occur. This heuristic avoids the difficult or impossible task of working out how diagnostic each possible question will be. However, it is not universally reliable, so people can overlook challenges to their existing beliefs.

Motivational explanations involve an effect of <a href="desire%20%28emotion%29">desire</a> on <a href="belief">belief</a>, sometimes called "<a href="wishful%20thinking">wishful thinking</a>". It is known that people prefer pleasant thoughts over unpleasant ones in a number of ways: this is called the "<a href="Pollyanna%20principle">Pollyanna principle</a>". Applied to <a href="argument">argument</a>s or sources of <a href="evidence">evidence</a>, this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true. According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion, people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas. In other words, they ask, "Can I believe this?" for some suggestions and, "Must I believe this?" for others. Although <a href="consistency">consistency</a> is a desirable feature of attitudes, an excessive drive for consistency is another potential source of bias because it may prevent people from neutrally evaluating new, surprising information. Social psychologist <a href="Ziva%20Kunda">Ziva Kunda</a> combines the cognitive and motivational theories, arguing that motivation creates the bias, but cognitive factors determine the size of the effect.

Explanations in terms of <a href="cost-benefit%20analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way, but assess the costs of different errors. Using ideas from <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a>, James Friedrich suggests that people do not primarily aim at <a href="truth">truth</a> in testing hypotheses, but try to avoid the most costly errors. For example, employers might ask one-sided questions in job interviews because they are focused on weeding out unsuitable candidates. Yaacov Trope and Akiva Liberman's refinement of this theory assumes that people compare the two different kinds of error: accepting a false hypothesis or rejecting a true hypothesis. For instance, someone who underestimates a friend's honesty might treat him or her suspiciously and so undermine the friendship. Overestimating the friend's honesty may also be costly, but less so. In this case, it would be rational to seek, evaluate or remember evidence of their honesty in a biased way. When someone gives an initial impression of being introverted or extroverted, questions that match that impression come across as more <a href="empathic">empathic</a>. This suggests that when talking to someone who seems to be an introvert, it is a sign of better <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> to ask, "Do you feel awkward in social situations?" rather than, "Do you like noisy parties?" The connection between confirmation bias and social skills was corroborated by a study of how college students get to know other people. Highly <a href="self-monitoring">self-monitoring</a> students, who are more sensitive to their environment and to <a href="social%20norms">social norms</a>, asked more matching questions when interviewing a high-status staff member than when getting to know fellow students.

Psychologists <a href="Jennifer%20Lerner">Jennifer Lerner</a> and <a href="Philip%20Tetlock">Philip Tetlock</a> distinguish two different kinds of thinking process. "<a href="Exploratory%20thought">Exploratory thought</a>" neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position, while "confirmatory thought" seeks to justify a specific point of view. Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know, they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people, and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification. Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to others who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they don't already know. Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are using confirmatory thought most of the time.

Developmental psychologist Eve Whitmore has argued that beliefs and biases involved in confirmation bias have their roots in childhood coping through make-believe, which becomes "the basis for more complex forms of self-deception and illusion into adulthood." The friction brought on by questioning as an adolescent with developing critical thinking can lead to the rationalization of false beliefs, and the habit of such rationalization can become unconscious over the years.

In <a href="social%20media">social media</a>, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of <a href="filter%20bubble">filter bubble</a>s, or “algorithmic editing”, which shows individuals information that they are more likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views. Some have argued that confirmation bias is the reason why society can never escape from filter bubbles, because individuals are psychologically hardwired to seek information that agrees with our preexisting values and beliefs. Others have further argued that the mixture of the two is degrading <a href="democracy">democracy</a>—claiming that this “algorithmic editing” removes diverse viewpoints and information—and that unless filter bubble algorithms are removed, voters will be unable to make fully informed political decisions.

Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident, ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money. In studies of <a href="election%20stock%20market">political stock markets</a>, investors made more profit when they resisted bias. For example, participants who interpreted a candidate's debate performance in a neutral rather than partisan way were more likely to profit. To combat the effect of confirmation bias, investors can try to adopt a contrary viewpoint "for the sake of argument". In one technique, they imagine that their investments have collapsed and ask themselves why this might happen.

Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist, blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the <a href="History%20of%20medicine">arrival of scientific medicine</a>. If a patient recovered, medical authorities counted the treatment as successful, rather than looking for alternative explanations such as that the disease had run its natural course. Biased assimilation is a factor in the modern appeal of <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a>, whose proponents are swayed by positive <a href="anecdotal%20evidence">anecdotal evidence</a> but treat <a href="scientific%20evidence">scientific evidence</a> hyper-critically.
Confirmation bias may also cause doctors to perform unnecessary medical procedures due to pressure from adamant patients.
<a href="Cognitive%20therapy">Cognitive therapy</a> was developed by <a href="Aaron%20T.%20Beck">Aaron T. Beck</a> in the early 1960s and has become a popular approach. According to Beck, biased information processing is a factor in <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>. His approach teaches people to treat evidence impartially, rather than selectively reinforcing negative outlooks. <a href="Phobias">Phobias</a> and <a href="hypochondria">hypochondria</a> have also been shown to involve confirmation bias for threatening information.

Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to. Since the evidence in a jury trial can be complex, and jurors often reach decisions about the verdict early on, it is reasonable to expect an attitude polarization effect. The prediction that jurors will become more extreme in their views as they see more evidence has been borne out in experiments with <a href="mock%20trial">mock trial</a>s. Both <a href="Inquisitorial%20system">inquisitorial</a> and <a href="Adversarial%20system">adversarial</a> criminal justice systems are affected by confirmation bias.

Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position. On the other hand, confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict. For example, psychologists <a href="Stuart%20Sutherland">Stuart Sutherland</a> and Thomas Kida have each argued that <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> Admiral <a href="Husband%20E.%20Kimmel">Husband E. Kimmel</a> showed confirmation bias when playing down the first signs of the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.

A two-decade study of political pundits by <a href="Philip%20E.%20Tetlock">Philip E. Tetlock</a> found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance. Tetlock divided experts into "foxes" who maintained multiple hypotheses, and "hedgehogs" who were more dogmatic. In general, the hedgehogs were much less accurate. Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias—specifically, their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.

A distinguishing feature of <a href="science">scientific thinking</a> is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence. However, many times in the <a href="history%20of%20science">history of science</a>, scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or ignoring unfavorable data. Previous research has shown that the assessment of the quality of scientific studies seems to be particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias. It has been found several times that scientists rate studies that report findings consistent with their prior beliefs more favorably than studies reporting findings inconsistent with their previous beliefs. However, assuming that the research question is relevant, the experimental design adequate and the data are clearly and comprehensively described, the found results should be of importance to the scientific community and should not be viewed prejudicially, regardless of whether they conform to current theoretical predictions.

In the context of scientific research, confirmation biases can sustain theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence; the field of <a href="parapsychology">parapsychology</a> has been particularly affected.

An experimenter's confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported. Data that conflict with the experimenter's expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable, producing the so-called <a href="publication%20bias">file drawer effect</a>. To combat this tendency, scientific training teaches ways to prevent bias. For example, <a href="Design%20of%20experiments">experimental design</a> of <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>s (coupled with their <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>) aims to minimize sources of bias. The social process of <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a> is thought to mitigate the effect of individual scientists' biases, even though the peer review process itself may be susceptible to such biases. Confirmation bias may thus be especially harmful to objective evaluations regarding nonconforming results since biased individuals may regard opposing evidence to be weak in principle and give little serious thought to revising their beliefs. Scientific innovators often meet with resistance from the scientific community, and research presenting controversial results frequently receives harsh peer review.

Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves. "<a href="Self-verification">Self-verification</a>" is the drive to reinforce the existing <a href="self-image">self-image</a> and "<a href="self-enhancement">self-enhancement</a>" is the drive to seek positive feedback. Both are served by confirmation biases. In experiments where people are given feedback that conflicts with their self-image, they are less likely to attend to it or remember it than when given self-verifying feedback. They reduce the impact of such information by interpreting it as unreliable. Similar experiments have found a preference for positive feedback, and the people who give it, over negative feedback.

One factor in the appeal of alleged <a href="psychic">psychic</a> readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic's statements to their own lives. By making a large number of ambiguous statements in each sitting, the psychic gives the client more opportunities to find a match. This is one of the techniques of <a href="cold%20reading">cold reading</a>, with which a psychic can deliver a subjectively impressive reading without any prior information about the client. Investigator <a href="James%20Randi">James Randi</a> compared the transcript of a reading to the client's report of what the psychic had said, and found that the client showed a strong selective recall of the "hits".

As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world, Nickerson mentions numerological <a href="pyramidology">pyramidology</a>: the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids. There are many different length measurements that can be made of, for example, the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> and many ways to combine or manipulate them. Hence it is almost inevitable that people who look at these numbers selectively will find superficially impressive correspondences, for example with the dimensions of the Earth.

When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way, their views can move even further apart. This is called "attitude polarization". The effect was demonstrated by an experiment that involved drawing a series of red and black balls from one of two concealed "bingo baskets". Participants knew that one basket contained 60% black and 40% red balls; the other, 40% black and 60% red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw—whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.

A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence. Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift <a href="correlation">correlated</a> strongly with their initial attitudes. In later experiments, participants also reported their opinions becoming more extreme in response to ambiguous information. However, comparisons of their attitudes before and after the new evidence showed no significant change, suggesting that the self-reported changes might not be real. Based on these experiments, Deanna Kuhn and Joseph Lao concluded that polarization is a real phenomenon but far from inevitable, only happening in a small minority of cases. They found that it was prompted not only by considering mixed evidence, but by merely thinking about the topic.

Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response. The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of <a href="gun%20politics">gun control</a> and <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a>. They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example, they could read the <a href="National%20Rifle%20Association">National Rifle Association</a>'s and the <a href="Brady%20Campaign">Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition</a>'s arguments on gun control. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not. This biased search for information correlated well with the polarization effect.

The is a name for the finding that given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly. The phrase was first coined by <a href="Brendan%20Nyhan">Brendan Nyhan</a> and Jason Reifler in 2010. However, subsequent research has since failed to replicate findings supporting the backfire effect. One study conducted out of the Ohio State University and George Washington University studied 10,100 participants with 52 different issues expected to trigger a backfire effect. While the findings did conclude that individuals are reluctant to embrace facts that contradict their already held ideology, no cases of backfire were detected. The backfire effect has since been noted to be a rare phenomenon rather than a common occurrence (compare the <a href="Boomerang%20effect%20%28psychology%29">boomerang effect</a>).

Confirmation biases can be used to explain why some beliefs persist when the initial evidence for them is removed. This belief perseverance effect has been shown by a series of experiments using what is called the "debriefing paradigm": participants read fake evidence for a hypothesis, their <a href="attitude%20change">attitude change</a> is measured, then the fakery is exposed in detail. Their attitudes are then measured once more to see if their belief returns to its previous level.

A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debriefing. In one experiment, participants had to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes. The feedback was random: some were told they had done well while others were told they had performed badly. Even after being fully debriefed, participants were still influenced by the feedback. They still thought they were better or worse than average at that kind of task, depending on what they had initially been told.

In another study, participants read <a href="job%20performance">job performance</a> ratings of two firefighters, along with their responses to a <a href="risk%20aversion">risk aversion</a> test. This fictional data was arranged to show either a negative or positive <a href="correlation">association</a>: some participants were told that a risk-taking firefighter did better, while others were told they did less well than a risk-averse colleague. Even if these two case studies were true, they would have been scientifically poor evidence for a conclusion about firefighters in general. However, the participants found them subjectively persuasive. When the case studies were shown to be fictional, participants' belief in a link diminished, but around half of the original effect remained. Follow-up interviews established that the participants had understood the debriefing and taken it seriously. Participants seemed to trust the debriefing, but regarded the discredited information as irrelevant to their personal belief.

The "" is the tendency to believe previously learned misinformation even after it has been corrected. Misinformation can still influence inferences one generates after a correction has occurred.

Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series, even when the order is unimportant. For example, people form a more positive impression of someone described as "intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious" than when they are given the same words in reverse order. This "irrational primacy effect" is independent of the <a href="serial%20position%20effect">primacy effect in memory</a> in which the earlier items in a series leave a stronger memory trace. Biased interpretation offers an explanation for this effect: seeing the initial evidence, people form a working hypothesis that affects how they interpret the rest of the information.

One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns. Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them. In fact, the colors appeared in a prearranged order. The first thirty draws favored one urn and the next thirty favored the other. The series as a whole was neutral, so rationally, the two urns were equally likely. However, after sixty draws, participants favored the urn suggested by the initial thirty.

Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide. After each slide, participants had to state their best guess of what the object was. Participants whose early guesses were wrong persisted with those guesses, even when the picture was sufficiently in focus that the object was readily recognizable to other people.

Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data. This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s. In one experiment, participants read a set of psychiatric case studies, including responses to the <a href="Rorschach%20inkblot%20test">Rorschach inkblot test</a>. The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set were more likely to report seeing buttocks, anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the inkblots. In fact the fictional case studies had been constructed so that the homosexual men were no more likely to report this imagery or, in one version of the experiment, were less likely to report it than heterosexual men. In a survey, a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality.

Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period. Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions, although the real correlation was zero.

This effect is a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs. It is also related to biases in hypothesis-testing behavior. In judging whether two events, such as illness and bad weather, are correlated, people rely heavily on the number of "positive-positive" cases: in this example, instances of both pain and bad weather. They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain and/or good weather). This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing. It may also reflect selective recall, in that people may have a sense that two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together.

1930 FIFA World Cup

The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>, the world championship for <a href="List%20of%20men%27s%20national%20association%20football%20teams">men's national</a> <a href="association%20football">association football</a> teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>, football's international <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its <a href="Constitution%20of%20Uruguay">first constitution</a>, and the <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay national football team</a> had successfully retained their football title at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201928%20Summer%20Olympics">1928 Summer Olympics</a>. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, the majority at the <a href="Estadio%20Centenario">Estadio Centenario</a>, which was built for the tournament.

Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>, who defeated <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a> 4–1 and <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> 3–0, respectively. <a href="Lucien%20Laurent">Lucien Laurent</a> of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper <a href="Jimmy%20Douglas%20%28American%20soccer%29">Jimmy Douglas</a> posted the first official "<a href="clean%20sheet">clean sheet</a>" in the tournament.

<a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, Uruguay, the United States and <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a> each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 68,346 people, and became the first nation to win the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a>.

The first World Cup was the only one without <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification</a>. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, <a href="Bolivia%20national%20football%20team">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a>, <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>, <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Peru%20national%20football%20team">Peru</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a> all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a>, even though the British <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.
FIFA president <a href="Jules%20Rimet">Jules Rimet</a> intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>, <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, <a href="Romania%20national%20football%20team">Romania</a>, and <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a>. The Romanians, managed by <a href="Constantin%20R%C4%83dulescu%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201896%29">Constantin Rădulescu</a> and coached by their captain <a href="Rudolf%20Wetzer">Rudolf Wetzer</a> and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">King Carol II</a>. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender <a href="Manuel%20Anatol">Manuel Anatol</a> nor the team's regular coach <a href="Gaston%20Barreau">Gaston Barreau</a> could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president <a href="Rodolphe%20Seeldrayers">Rodolphe Seeldrayers</a>.

The Romanians boarded the <a href="SS%20Conte%20Verde">SS "Conte Verde"</a> at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, Italy, the French were picked up at <a href="Villefranche-sur-Mer">Villefranche-sur-Mer</a>, France on 21 June 1930; and the Belgians embarked at <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain. The "Conte Verde" carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians <a href="Jean%20Langenus">Jean Langenus</a> and <a href="Henri%20Christophe%20%28referee%29">Henri Christophe</a>, along with <a href="Thomas%20Balvay">Thomas Balway</a>, a Parisian who may have been English. The <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian</a> team were picked up when the boat docked in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship "Florida" from <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, France.

In the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander I</a> did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, Yugoslavia football association officials decided to round up only domestic (<a href="Serbian%20people">Serbian</a>) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, <a href="OFK%20Beograd">BSK</a> and <a href="SK%20Jugoslavija">SK Jugoslavija</a>, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (<a href="Ivan%20Bek">Ivan Bek</a> among them). 
Therefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, <a href="Blagoje%20Marjanovi%C4%87">Blagoje Marjanović</a> ("Moša") and <a href="Aleksandar%20Tirnani%C4%87">Aleksandar Tirnanić</a> ("Tirke"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname "The Ich-es" or "Ichachos" (in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the "-ić" or "-vić" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the joint–biggest success in both <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav</a> and <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Serbia">Serbian</a> subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962</a>.

Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event. Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.

All matches took place in <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>. Three stadiums were used: <a href="Estadio%20Centenario">Estadio Centenario</a>, <a href="Estadio%20Pocitos">Estadio Pocitos</a>, and <a href="Estadio%20Gran%20Parque%20Central">Estadio Parque Central</a>. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso, it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a "temple of football". With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles. The stadium hosted 10 of the 18 matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament. Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs <a href="Club%20Nacional%20de%20Football">Nacional</a> and <a href="Pe%C3%B1arol">Peñarol</a>, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.

Fifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans – two Belgians (<a href="Henri%20Christophe%20%28referee%29">Henri Christophe</a> and <a href="John%20Langenus">John Langenus</a>), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (<a href="Constantin%20R%C4%83dulescu%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201896%29">Constantin Rădulescu</a>, also the Romanian team coach), and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.

Of all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of <a href="Gilberto%20de%20Almeida%20R%C3%AAgo">Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo</a> in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian <a href="Ulises%20Saucedo">Ulises Saucedo</a>'s in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6–3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia, awarded three penalties.

The following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.


The 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing three. Each group played a <a href="Round-robin%20tournament">round-robin</a> format, with the four group winners progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.

Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were <a href="Seed%20%28tennis%29">seeded</a>, and were kept apart in the draw, which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.

Since there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4–1 at the <a href="Estadio%20Pocitos">Estadio Pocitos</a>, while the United States defeated Belgium 3–0 at the same time at the <a href="Estadio%20Gran%20Parque%20Central">Estadio Gran Parque Central</a>. France's <a href="Lucien%20Laurent">Lucien Laurent</a> was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.

The first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper <a href="Alex%20Th%C3%A9pot">Alex Thépot</a> had to leave the field after 20 minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by <a href="Luis%20Monti">Luis Monti</a>, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti <a href="direct%20free%20kick">free kick</a>. The game featured an officiating controversy when referee <a href="Gilberto%20de%20Almeida%20R%C3%AAgo">Almeida Rêgo</a> erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman <a href="Marcel%20Langiller">Marcel Langiller</a> clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players. Although France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.

France's final match, against Chile, featured the first <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a> of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thépot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's <a href="Carlos%20Vidal">Carlos Vidal</a> in the 30th minute of the match. In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>s were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martínez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster. <a href="Guillermo%20St%C3%A1bile">Guillermo Stábile</a> scored a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> in his international debut as Argentina won 6–3, despite the absence of their captain <a href="Manuel%20Ferreira%20%28footballer%29">Manuel Ferreira</a>, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam. Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti. Argentina won 3–1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.

The second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2–1 to Yugoslavia. Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling "Viva Uruguay" as the team lined up. Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle. Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed. Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1–0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman <a href="Preguinho">Preguinho</a>. Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.

Hosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plácido Galindo of Peru was <a href="sent%20off">dismissed</a> against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3–1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.

Because of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Mazali">Andrés Mazali</a> was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife. One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0. Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal. The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru. Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.

The fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a>, were reputedly nicknamed "the shot-putters" by an unnamed source in the French contingent. They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3–0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper "Imparcial" wrote that "the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts". Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the <a href="association%20football%20pitch">pitch</a> and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was <a href="Offside%20%28association%20football%29">offside</a>. The group's second match, played in windy conditions, witnessed the first tournament <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, scored by <a href="Bert%20Patenaude">Bert Patenaude</a> of the United States against <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a>. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by <a href="Guillermo%20St%C3%A1bile">Guillermo Stábile</a> of <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate <a href="Tom%20Florie">Tom Florie</a> was reattributed to Patenaude. With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a <a href="dead%20rubber">dead rubber</a>. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1–0 margin.

The four group winners, <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, Yugoslavia, <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the US and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.

In the second semi-final there were shades of the <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924 Summer Olympics</a> match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through <a href="%C4%90or%C4%91e%20Vujadinovi%C4%87">Vujadinović</a>. Uruguay then took a 2–1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision. The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6–1, <a href="Pedro%20Cea">Pedro Cea</a> completing a hat-trick.

The now-traditional <a href="third%20place%20play-off">third place play-off</a> was not established until <a href="1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1934</a>, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia. Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.

At the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (<a href="Tom%20Florie">Tom Florie</a>) and Yugoslavia (<a href="Milutin%20Ivkovi%C4%87">Milutin Ivković</a>) both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a> included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records, a practice since continued by FIFA. In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Yugoslavia">Football Association of Yugoslavia</a> at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.

The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201928%20Summer%20Olympics%23Gold%20medal%20match">1928 Olympic final</a>, which Uruguay had won 2–1 after a replay.

The final was played at the <a href="Estadio%20Centenario">Estadio Centenario</a> on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the <a href="La%20Plata%20Basin">La Plata Basin</a> as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry "Victoria o muerte" ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before <a href="kick-off%20%28association%20football%29">kick-off</a>, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian <a href="John%20Langenus">John Langenus</a>, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.

The hosts scored the opening goal through <a href="Pablo%20Dorado">Pablo Dorado</a>, a low shot from a position on the right. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; <a href="Carlos%20Peucelle">Carlos Peucelle</a> received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his <a href="marking%20%28association%20football%29">marker</a> and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and <a href="Pedro%20Cea">Pedro Cea</a> scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by <a href="Santos%20Iriarte">Santos Iriarte</a> gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the <a href="Jules%20Rimet%20Trophy">World Cup Trophy</a>, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Jude">Raúl Jude</a>. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. <a href="Francisco%20Varallo">Francisco Varallo</a> (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.

France, Yugoslavia and the United States all played <a href="friendly%20match">friendlies</a> in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August, while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.

Uruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954</a>.

With eight goals, Guillermo Stábile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 36 players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.







In 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition. The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:

The last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was <a href="Ernesto%20Mascheroni">Ernesto Mascheroni</a>, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender <a href="Emilio%20Recoba">Emilio Recoba</a> who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's <a href="Francisco%20Varallo">Francisco Varallo</a>, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 – eighty years after the tournament. <a href="Lucien%20Laurent">Lucien Laurent</a>, the scorer of the first ever World Cup Goal was the last surviving Member of the France Squad and was invited in 1998 Final seeing France lifting its first ever World Cup win also as the only France member. He died in 2005 at the age of 97.

Smells Like Teen Spirit

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a song by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>" (1991), released on <a href="DGC%20Records">DGC Records</a>.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana's biggest hit, placing high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992. The unexpected success propelled "Nevermind" to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where <a href="grunge">grunge</a> entered the mainstream.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" received critical plaudits, including topping the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll and winning two <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a> for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of <a href="Generation%20X">Generation X</a>, but the band grew uncomfortable with the attention it brought them. In the years since <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs in the history of rock music.

Nirvana frontman <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> said that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was an attempt to write a song in the style of the <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, a band he greatly admired:

Cobain came up with the song's title when his friend <a href="Kathleen%20Hanna">Kathleen Hanna</a>, at the time the lead singer of the <a href="riot%20grrrl">riot grrrl</a> band <a href="Bikini%20Kill">Bikini Kill</a>, wrote "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on his wall. Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant <a href="Teen%20Spirit%20%28deodorant%29">Teen Spirit</a>, which his then-girlfriend <a href="Tobi%20Vail">Tobi Vail</a> wore. Cobain said he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was, along with "<a href="Come%20as%20You%20Are%20%28Nirvana%20song%29">Come as You Are</a>", one of several songs written following Nirvana's first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990. Cobain began writing it a few weeks before recording Nirvana's second album, "Nevermind", in 1991. When he presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main <a href="guitar%20riff">guitar riff</a> and the chorus vocal melody, which bassist <a href="Krist%20Novoselic">Krist Novoselic</a> dismissed as "ridiculous". In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing the riff more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat. As a result, it is the only song on "Nevermind" to credit all three band members as writers.

Prior to the "Nevermind" recording sessions, the band sent Vig a cassette demo of song rehearsals including "Teen Spirit". While the sound of the tape was distorted due to the band playing at a loud volume, Vig felt the song had promise. Vig and the band recorded "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at Sound City recording studio in <a href="Van%20Nuys">Van Nuys</a>, California in May1991. Vig suggested changes to the arrangement, including moving a guitar ad lib to the chorus and shortening the chorus. The band recorded the basic track in three takes, and used the second take. Vig corrected some timing errors created by Cobain switching between his guitar effects pedals. Vig was only able to get three vocal takes from Cobain; the producer commented, "I was lucky to ever get Kurt to do four takes."

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was recorded in the original key of <a href="F%20minor">F minor</a> and follows a F–B–A–D chord progression, with the main guitar riff constructed from four <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s played in a <a href="Syncopation">syncopated</a> <a href="sixteenth%20note">sixteenth note</a> strum by Cobain. The guitar chords were <a href="double%20tracking">double tracked</a> to create a "more powerful" sound. The chords occasionally lapse into <a href="Added%20tone%20chord">suspended chord</a> voicings as a result of Cobain playing the bottom four strings of the guitar for the thickness of sound. The riff resembles that of <a href="Boston%20%28band%29">Boston</a>'s 1976 hit "<a href="More%20Than%20a%20Feeling">More Than a Feeling</a>", though it is not identical. Cobain said: "It was such a clichéd riff. It was so close to a Boston riff or <a href="The%20Kingsmen">The Kingsmen</a>'s '<a href="Louie%20Louie">Louie Louie</a>. During the verses, Cobain used a <a href="Small%20Clone">Small Clone</a> effect pedal to add a <a href="chorus%20effect">chorus</a> effect.
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" uses a "somewhat conventional formal structure" consisting of four-, eight-, and twelve-bar sections, including an eight-bar verse, an eight-bar pre-chorus, and a twelve-bar chorus. Musicologist Graeme Downes, who led the band the <a href="The%20Verlaines">Verlaines</a>, says that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" illustrates <a href="developing%20variation">developing variation</a>. Elements of the structure are marked with shifts in volume and dynamics, moving from quiet to loud several times. This structure of "quiet verses with wobbly, chorused guitar, followed by big, loud <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore</a>-inspired choruses" became an alternative rock template.

During the verses the band maintains the same chord progression as the chorus. Cobain plays a two-note guitar line over Novoselic's root-note <a href="eighth%20note">eighth note</a> bassline, which outlines the chord progression. Approaching the chorus, Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the word "Hello". Following the first and second choruses, Cobain simultaneously sings the word "Yay" and performs a unison bend on his guitar. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo restating his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus. During the closing refrain, Cobain sings "A denial" repeatedly; his voice becomes strained from the force of yelling.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was released to radio on August 27, 1991. On September 10, it was released as the lead single from "Nevermind", Nirvana's major label debut on <a href="DGC%20Records">DGC Records</a>. The song did not initially chart, and sold well only in regions of the United States with an established Nirvana fanbase.

The single was intended to be a base-building alternative rock cut from the album, and not expected to be a hit; the follow-up single "Come as You Are" was planned as the single that could cross over to mainstream formats. However, <a href="campus%20radio">campus radio</a> and <a href="modern%20rock">modern rock</a> radio stations placed "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain said: "None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous ... They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it."

The video received its world premiere on MTV's late-night alternative rock program "<a href="120%20Minutes">120 Minutes</a>", and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation. MTV added the video to its "Buzz Bin" selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, music video, and the "Nevermind" album had become hits. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Nevermind" became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was also a critical success. It topped the 1991 "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" "<a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>" and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" year-end polls, and reached number two on "Rolling Stone's" list of best singles of the year. The single peaked at number six on the "Billboard" singles chart the same week that "Nevermind" reached number one on the albums chart. "Teen Spirit" hit number one on the <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart, and has been <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified platinum</a> (onemillion copies shipped) by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. However, many American <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> stations were reluctant to play the song in regular rotation, and restricted it to night-time play.

The single was also successful in other countries. In the United Kingdom, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" reached number seven and charted for 184 weeks. The song was nominated for two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s: <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Hard%20Rock%20Performance">Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Song">Best Rock Song</a>. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" would later name Nirvana's loss to Eric Clapton in the Best Rock Song category as one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history. Outside the United States, the song topped the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand, and Spain. It charted within the top five of several European countries and reached number five in Australia. It appeared on several year-end charts, including number 10 in New Zealand, number 17 in Belgium and Germany, and number 32 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 Year-End Chart.

In the wake of Nirvana's success, <a href="Michael%20Azerrad">Michael Azerrad</a> wrote in a 1992 "Rolling Stone" article: "'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a spokesman for a generation." Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an "anthem-of-a-generation" status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation’s version of the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>' 1976 single, '<a href="Anarchy%20in%20the%20U.K.">Anarchy in the U.K.</a>', if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title ... as Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold."

Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the song's success, and in later concerts often excluded it from the set list. Prior to the release of the band's 1993 follow-up album "<a href="In%20Utero%20%28album%29">In Utero</a>", Novoselic remarked, "If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how "Nevermind" would have done ... There are no 'Teen Spirits' on "In Utero"." Cobain said in 1994, "I still like playing 'Teen Spirit', but it's almost an embarrassment to play it ... Everyone has focused on that song so much."

In the years following <a href="Suicide%20of%20Kurt%20Cobain">Cobain's 1994 suicide</a> and Nirvana's breakup, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" has continued to garner critical acclaim, and is often listed as one of the greatest songs of all time. It was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>'s list of "<a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23%26quot%3BThe%20Songs%20That%20Shaped%20Rock%20and%20Roll%26quot%3B">The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll</a>" in 1997. In 2000, <a href="VH1">VH1</a> rated the song at number forty-one on its "100 Greatest Rock Songs" list, while MTV and "Rolling Stone" ranked it third on their joint list of the "100 Greatest Pop Songs".<ref name="MTV/RS 2000"></ref> The Recording Industry Association of America placed "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at number eighty on their 2001 "<a href="Songs%20of%20the%20Century">Songs of the Century</a>" list. In 2002, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" awarded the song the number two spot on its list of "100 Greatest Singles of All Time", with "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" ranking it at number one on its own list of the "100 Greatest Singles of All Time". VH1 placed "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at number one on its list of "100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years" in 2003, while that same year, the song came third in a "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" poll of the "1001 Best Songs Ever". In 2004, "Rolling Stone" ranked "Smells Like Teen Spirit" ninth on its list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>", and described its impact as "a shock wave of big-amp purity", noting that "[it] wiped the lingering jive of the Eighties off the pop map overnight." The song was placed at number six in "NME"s "Global Best Song Ever Poll" in 2005.

In the 2006 <a href="VH1%20%28UK%20%26amp%3B%20Ireland%29">VH1 UK</a> poll "The Nation's Favourite Lyric", the line "I feel stupid and contagious / Here we are now, entertain us" was ranked the third-favorite lyric by over 13,000 voters. VH1 placed "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at number one on its list of the "100 Greatest Songs Of The '90s" in 2007, while "Rolling Stone" ranked it number ten on its list of "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time". In 2009, the song was voted number one for the third time in a row on the <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100">Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time</a> in Australia (it was first place previously in 1991 and 1998). That year, VH1 ranked the song seventh on its list of the "100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs". Despite previously proposing in its 2006 entry for "Nevermind" on "The All-TIME 100 Albums" that Smells Like Teen Spirit' ... may be the album's worst song," "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine later included it on its list of "The All-TIME 100 Songs" in 2011. That same year, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" kept its number nine ranking on "Rolling Stone"s updated list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". "NME" placed the song at number two on its list of the "100 Best Tracks Of The '90s" in 2012, and at number one on its list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" in 2014. In 2015, the song was also named the most iconic song of all time according to a study by Goldsmith's College, which analysed various songs featured in numerous 'all-time best' lists, using analytical software to compare their key, BPM, chord variety, lyrical content, timbral variety, and sonic variance the result of which designated the title to this song.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was rereleased as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single in December2011. In an attempt to emulate a successful 2009 <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> campaign to promote <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>'s song "<a href="Killing%20in%20the%20Name">Killing in the Name</a>", an online campaign was launched to promote "Smells Like Teen Spirit" to 2011 <a href="List%20of%20UK%20Singles%20Chart%20Christmas%20number%20ones">Christmas number one</a> in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> in protest at the dealings of "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29">The X Factor</a>" television series with the children's charity <a href="Rhythmix%20%28charity%29">Rhythmix</a>. A similar campaign was also launched in Ireland to get the track to 2011 <a href="List%20of%20Irish%20Singles%20Chart%20Christmas%20number%20ones">Christmas number one</a> in the <a href="Irish%20Singles%20Chart">Irish Singles Chart</a>. The campaign resulted in the song reaching number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 30,000 copies.

The lyrics to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the "Nevermind" album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen</a> promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the "<a href="Lithium%20%28Nirvana%20song%29">Lithium</a>" single in 1992. American rock critic <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a> noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was "the '<a href="Louie%20Louie">Louie Louie</a>' of the nineties" and wrote, "Like 'Louie', only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," and added, "Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts."

The book "Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song" describes "Teen Spirit" as "a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness". Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as "It's fun to lose and to pretend") and states "the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator—he's angry that he's confused". Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is "alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea". In "<a href="Heavier%20Than%20Heaven">Heavier Than Heaven</a>", <a href="Charles%20R.%20Cross">Charles R. Cross</a>' biography of Cobain, Cross argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line "She's over-bored and self-assured" and states the song "could not have been about anyone else". Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as "Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted teens."

"Teen Spirit" is widely interpreted as a <a href="Adolescence">teen</a> revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the music video. In an interview conducted the day "Nevermind" was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults ... It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme." In Michael Azerrad's biography "", Cobain said he felt a duty "to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age". He also said, "The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas ... It's just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought." As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the meaning. Grohl stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes."

The music video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was the first for director <a href="Samuel%20Bayer">Samuel Bayer</a>. Bayer believed he was hired because his <a href="Show%20reel">test reel</a> was so poor the band anticipated his production would be "punk" and "not corporate". The video is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by <a href="Jonathan%20Kaplan">Jonathan Kaplan</a>'s 1979 film "<a href="Over%20the%20Edge%20%28film%29">Over the Edge</a>" and the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>' film "<a href="Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20High%20School">Rock 'n' Roll High School</a>". It had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.

The video was filmed August 17, 1991 on a soundstage in <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City</a>. The music video features Nirvana playing at a <a href="pep%20rally">pep rally</a> in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the <a href="Anarchist%20symbolism%23Circle-A">Circle-A</a> anarchist symbol. The video features an appearance by <a href="Burton%20C.%20Bell">Burton C. Bell</a>, later known as frontman of heavy metal band <a href="Fear%20Factory">Fear Factory</a>. Occasionally, the scene cuts to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the students destroying the set and the band's gear. The discontent was genuine; the extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to <a href="moshing">mosh</a>, and the set became a scene of chaos. "Once the kids came out dancing they just said 'fuck you', because they were so tired of his shit throughout the day," Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and oversaw a re-edit of the video, creating the final version. One of Cobain's major additions was the penultimate shot, a close-up of his face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer said that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain was not vain, and was more interested that "the video had something that was truly about what they were about".

Like the song itself, the music video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" received positive reviews. "Rolling Stone" writer <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> described the video as looking like "the greatest gig you could ever imagine". In addition to a number-one placing in the singles category, "Teen Spirit" also topped the music video category in the "Village Voice"s 1991 "Pazz & Jop" poll. The video won Nirvana the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20New%20Artist">Best New Artist</a> and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Video">Best Alternative Group</a> awards at the 1992 <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>, and in 2000 the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" named "Teen Spirit" the Most Played Video on <a href="MTV%20Europe">MTV Europe</a>. In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's Programming department, claimed the video "changed the entire look of MTV" by giving them "a whole new generation to sell to". "Rolling Stone" placed the music video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at number two on their 1993 list of "The 100 Top Music Videos". MTV ranked the song's music video at number three on its "100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made" list in 1999. VH1 placed the debut of the "Teen Spirit" video at number eighteen on its 2000 list of "100 Greatest Rock & Roll Moments on TV", noting that "the video [ushered] in alternative rock as a commercial and pop culture force". In 2001, VH1 ranked the video fourth on its "100 Greatest Videos" list. The video has been parodied at least twice: in <a href="%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s music video for "<a href="Smells%20Like%20Nirvana">Smells Like Nirvana</a>" and in <a href="Bob%20Sinclar">Bob Sinclar</a>'s 2006 music video for "<a href="Rock%20This%20Party%20%28Everybody%20Dance%20Now%29">Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)</a>".

Published on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> in 2009 upon the debut of the music video streaming website <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>, the video has over 880 million views .

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the <a href="OK%20Hotel">OK Hotel</a> in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set "<a href="With%20the%20Lights%20Out">With the Lights Out</a>", while shorter clips are included on the "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>" "<a href="Classic%20Albums">Classic Albums</a>" DVD, as well as the documentary film "<a href="Hype%21">Hype!</a>" As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with "Come out and play, make up the rules" instead of the eventual opening of "Load up on guns, bring your friends". A recording of the earlier version appears on "With the Lights Out" and again on "". A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary "", filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>.

Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and <a href="tempo">tempo</a> for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line "our little group has always been" changed to "our little tribe has always been", which can be heard on the 1996 live album "<a href="From%20the%20Muddy%20Banks%20of%20the%20Wishkah">From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</a>". "Rolling Stone" remarked that the "Wishkah" version of "Teen Spirit" "[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit". A notable alternate performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" occurred on <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, "Load up on guns, bring your friends" became "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former <a href="The%20Smiths">Smiths</a> frontman <a href="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>. When "Top of the Pops" was cancelled in 2006, "The Observer" listed Nirvana's performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance can be found on the 1994 home video "<a href="Live%21%20Tonight%21%20Sold%20Out%21%21">Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!</a>".

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" has inspired a few parodies. <a href="%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> parodied the song in 1992 with "<a href="Smells%20Like%20Nirvana">Smells Like Nirvana</a>", a song about Nirvana itself. Yankovic parodied the difficulty in understanding Cobain's singing as well as the lyrics and their meaning. Yankovic has said Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had "made it" when he heard the parody. In 1995, the <a href="queercore">queercore</a> band <a href="Pansy%20Division">Pansy Division</a> recorded a parody of the song called "Smells Like Queer Spirit" for its "<a href="Pile%20Up">Pile Up</a>" album. Pansy Division guitarist <a href="Jon%20Ginoli">Jon Ginoli</a> insisted that his band's version of the song was not a parody but "an affectionate tribute". In 2018, a video of the original Nirvana version was posted on <a href="Vimeo">Vimeo</a> that had been <a href="autotune">auto-tuned</a> to be in a major key. This resulted in the song sounding like a "mainstream pop song" or a <a href="Top%2040">Top 40 Rock</a> song.

In 1996, <a href="World%20Championship%20Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a> (WCW) debuted a theme song for a <a href="Wrestling">wrestler</a> known as <a href="Diamond%20Dallas%20Page">Diamond Dallas Page</a>. The song, named "Self High-Five", resembled "Smells Like Teen Spirit" very closely. Dave Grohl took notice and called it a "rip-off", saying, "WCW owes us money." The music was subsequently altered to sound different enough from "Teen Spirit". No lawsuits or further action took place, but on WWE Network that version was dubbed over an alternative version known as "Diamonds".

The song has also appeared in films. In the 2001 film "<a href="Moulin%20Rouge%21">Moulin Rouge!</a>", the song was sung during the "Can Can" scene introducing the titular nightclub. In the 2011 film "<a href="The%20Muppets%20%28film%29">The Muppets</a>" and <a href="The%20Muppets%20%28soundtrack%29">its soundtrack</a>, one of the acts of the Muppet Telethon involves <a href="Rowlf%20the%20Dog">Rowlf the Dog</a>, <a href="Link%20Hogthrob">Link Hogthrob</a>, <a href="Sam%20Eagle">Sam Eagle</a>, and <a href="Beaker%20%28Muppet%29">Beaker</a> performing the song as a <a href="Barbershop%20music">barbershop quartet</a>, where unwilling special guest <a href="Jack%20Black">Jack Black</a> accuses them of "ruining one of the greatest songs of all time". A cover of the song (performed by the band Think Up Anger with Malia J) was featured in one of the trailers for the 2015 film "<a href="The%20Gallows">The Gallows</a>". In the 2015 film "<a href="Pan%20%282015%20film%29">Pan</a>", a version of the song is sung by Blackbeard (<a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a>) and the miners when Peter first arrives in Neverland.

Pinniped

Pinnipeds, commonly known as seals, are a widely <a href="range%20%28biology%29">distributed</a> and diverse <a href="clade">clade</a> of <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a>, <a href="fin">fin</a>-footed, <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s. They comprise the <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a> <a href="Odobenidae">Odobenidae</a> (whose only living member is the <a href="walrus">walrus</a>), <a href="Otariidae">Otariidae</a> (the eared seals: <a href="sea%20lion">sea lion</a>s and <a href="fur%20seal">fur seal</a>s), and <a href="Phocidae">Phocidae</a> (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> evidence supports them as a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a> and their closest living relatives are believed to be <a href="bear">bear</a>s and the superfamily of <a href="Musteloidea">musteloid</a>s (<a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s, and <a href="red%20panda">red panda</a>s), having diverged about 50 million years ago.

Seals range in size from the and <a href="Baikal%20seal">Baikal seal</a> to the and <a href="southern%20elephant%20seal">southern elephant seal</a>, which is also the largest member of the order Carnivora. Several species exhibit <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into <a href="Flipper%20%28anatomy%29">flipper</a>s. Though not as fast in the water as <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced <a href="somatosensory%20system">tactile system</a> in their <a href="whiskers">whiskers</a> or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or <a href="blubber">blubber</a>, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.

Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, <a href="moulting">molt</a> or escape from predators, such as <a href="shark">shark</a>s and <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a>s. They feed largely on fish and <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>; but a few, like the <a href="leopard%20seal">leopard seal</a>, feed on large vertebrates, such as <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (<a href="Polygyny%20in%20nature">polygyny</a>), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for <a href="reproductive%20success">reproductive success</a> vary between defending females, defending <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> that attract females and performing <a href="Courtship%20display">ritual displays</a> or <a href="lek%20mating">lek mating</a>. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species <a href="fasting">fast</a> and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of <a href="animal%20communication">vocalizations</a>, notably the barks of <a href="California%20sea%20lion">California sea lion</a>s, the <a href="gong">gong</a>-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of <a href="Weddell%20seal">Weddell seal</a>s.

The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by <a href="Circumpolar%20peoples">indigenous peoples of the Arctic</a>. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly <a href="seal%20hunting">hunted</a> by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The <a href="Japanese%20sea%20lion">Japanese sea lion</a> and the <a href="Caribbean%20monk%20seal">Caribbean monk seal</a> have become extinct in the past century, while the <a href="Mediterranean%20monk%20seal">Mediterranean monk seal</a> and <a href="Hawaiian%20monk%20seal">Hawaiian monk seal</a> are ranked <a href="endangered">endangered</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from <a href="bycatch">accidental trapping</a>, <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>, and conflicts with local people.

The German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Karl%20Wilhelm%20Illiger">Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</a> was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> and an <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a>. American zoologist <a href="Joel%20Asaph%20Allen">Joel Asaph Allen</a> reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 <a href="monograph">monograph</a>, "History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America". In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave <a href="identification%20key">keys</a> to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species in other parts of the world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Pinnipedimorpha">Pinnipedimorpha</a> to contain the fossil genus "Enaliarctos" and modern seals as a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>. Pinnipeds belong to the order <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a> and the suborder <a href="Caniformia">Caniformia</a> (known as dog-like carnivorans). Pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under Carnivora. Of the three extant families, the <a href="Otariidae">Otariidae</a> and <a href="Odobenidae">Odobenidae</a> are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the <a href="Phocidae">Phocidae</a> belong to the superfamily Phocoidea.

Otariids are also known as eared seals due to the presence of <a href="Pinna%20%28anatomy%29">pinnae</a>. These animals rely on their well-developed fore-flippers to propel themselves through the water. They can also turn their hind-flippers forward and "walk" on land. The anterior end of an otariid's <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a>s extends between the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s, and the <a href="supraorbital%20foramen">supraorbital foramen</a> is large and flat horizontally. The <a href="supraspinatous%20fossa">supraspinatous fossa</a>s are divided by a "secondary spine" and the <a href="bronchi">bronchi</a> are divided anteriorly. Otariids consist of two types: <a href="sea%20lion">sea lion</a>s and <a href="fur%20seal">fur seal</a>s. Sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter, rougher <a href="pelage">pelage</a>, while fur seals have more pointed snouts, longer fore-flippers and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs. The former also tend to be larger than the latter. Five <a href="genera">genera</a> and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist, while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), a 2001 genetic study found that the northern fur seal is more closely related to several sea lion species. This is supported by a 2006 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study that also found that the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to "<a href="Arctocephalus">Arctocephalus</a>" than to other sea lions.

Odobenidae consists of only one living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the <a href="elephant%20seals">elephant seals</a>), nearly hairless skin and long upper <a href="Canine%20tooth">canines</a>, known as <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have <a href="pterygoid%20bone">pterygoid bone</a>s that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and <a href="calcaneus">calcaneus</a>es with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.

Phocids are known as true or "earless" seals. These animals lack external ear flaps and are incapable of turning their hind-flippers forward, which makes them more cumbersome on land. In water, true seals swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side. Phocids have <a href="Pachyostosis">thickened</a> <a href="Mastoid%20process">mastoid</a>s, enlarged <a href="Temporal%20bone%23In%20other%20animals">entotympanic bone</a>s, everted <a href="pelvic%20bone">pelvic bone</a>s and massive <a href="ankle%20bone">ankle bone</a>s. They also lack supraorbital processes on the frontal and have underdeveloped calcaneal tubers. A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of "Mirounga", <a href="Monachini">Monachini</a> and <a href="Lobodontini">Lobodontini</a>; and Phocinae, which includes "<a href="Pusa">Pusa</a>", "<a href="Phoca">Phoca</a>", "<a href="Halichoerus">Halichoerus</a>", "<a href="Histriophoca">Histriophoca</a>", "<a href="Pagophilus">Pagophilus</a>", "<a href="Erignathus">Erignathus</a>" and "<a href="Hooded%20seal">Cystophora</a>".

In a 2012 review of pinniped taxonomy, Berta and Morgan Churchill suggested that, based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and genetic criteria, there are 33 <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> species and 29 subspecies of pinnipeds, although five of the latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered subspecies. They recommend that the genus "Arctocephalus" be limited to "<a href="Arctocephalus%20pusillus">Arctocephalus pusillus</a>", and they resurrected the name "<a href="Arctophoca">Arctophoca</a>" for several species and subspecies formerly placed in "Arctocephalus". More than 50 fossil species have been described.

One popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are <a href="polyphyletic">diphyletic</a> (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a <a href="Most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">recent common ancestor</a> with <a href="bear">bear</a>s and phocids sharing one with <a href="Musteloidea">Musteloidea</a>. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> origin. Nevertheless, there is some dispute as to whether pinnipeds are more closely related to bears or musteloids, as some studies support the former theory and others the latter. Pinnipeds <a href="Cladogenesis">split</a> from other caniforms 50 million years ago (<a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>) during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of "<a href="Puijila%20darwini">Puijila darwini</a>" in <a href="early%20Miocene">early Miocene</a> deposits in <a href="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>, Canada. Like a modern <a href="otter">otter</a>, "Puijila" had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and shoulders were more robust and "Puijila" likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer—retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found "Puijila" placed it in a clade with "<a href="Potamotherium">Potamotherium</a>" (traditionally considered a <a href="mustelid">mustelid</a>) and "<a href="Enaliarctos">Enaliarctos</a>". Of the three, "Puijila" was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of "Puijila" in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.

"Enaliarctos", a fossil species of late <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>/early Miocene (24–22 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">Mya</a>) <a href="California">California</a>, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic life with a flexible spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for <a href="Shearing%20%28physics%29">shearing</a> (like terrestrial carnivorans), and it may have stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. "Enaliarctos" was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, "Enaliarctos emlongi", exhibited notable <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was "<a href="Pteronarctos">Pteronarctos</a>", which lived in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, "Pteroarctos" had an <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbital wall</a> that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the <a href="jugal">jugal</a> or <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>), but was mostly shaped by the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>.

The ancestors of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged 33 mya. The Phocidae are likely to have descended from the extinct family <a href="Desmatophocidae">Desmatophocidae</a> in the North Atlantic. Desmatophocids lived 23–10 Mya and had elongated skulls, fairly large eyes, <a href="zygomatic%20bone">cheekbones</a> connected by a <a href="Mortise%20and%20tenon">mortised</a> structure and rounded cheek teeth. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and hindflippers.

Phocids are known to have existed for at least 15 million years, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages 22 Mya. The fossil monachine "<a href="Monotherium">Monotherium</a>" and phocine "<a href="Leptophoca">Leptophoca</a>" were found in southeastern North America. The deep split between the lineages of "Erignathus" and "Cystophora" 17 Mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the North Atlantic. The genera "Phoca" and "Pusa" could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the <a href="Paratethys%20Sea">Paratethys Sea</a> to the <a href="Arctic%20Basin">Arctic Basin</a> and subsequently went eastward. The ancestor of the <a href="Baikal%20seal">Baikal seal</a> migrated into <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> from the Arctic (via the Siberian ice sheet) and became isolated there. The Caspian seal's ancestor became isolated as the Paratethys shrank, leaving the animal in a small remnant sea, the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. The monochines diversified southward. "Monachus" emerged in the Mediterranean and migrated to the Caribbean and then the central North Pacific. The two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4 mya after the <a href="Panamanian%20isthmus">Panamanian isthmus</a> was formed. The lobodontine lineage emerged around 9 mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a>.

The <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a> of Otariidae and Odobenidae split almost 28 Mya. Otariids originated in the North Pacific. The earliest fossil "<a href="Pithanotaria">Pithanotaria</a>", found in California, is dated to 11 mya. The "Callorhinus" lineage split earlier at 16 mya. "<a href="Zalophus">Zalophus</a>", "<a href="Eumetopias">Eumetopias</a>" and "<a href="Otaria">Otaria</a>" diverged next, with the latter colonizing the coast of South America. Most of the other otariids diversified in the Southern Hemisphere. The earliest fossils of Odobenidae—"<a href="Prototaria">Prototaria</a>" of Japan and "<a href="Proneotherium">Proneotherium</a>" of Oregon—date to 18–16 Mya. These primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus. Odobenids further diversified in the middle and <a href="late%20Miocene">late Miocene</a>. Several species had enlarged upper and lower canines. The genera "<a href="Valenictus">Valenictus</a>" and "Odobenus" developed elongated tusks. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (via the <a href="Central%20American%20Seaway">Central American Seaway</a>) 8–5 Mya and subsequently made it to the North Atlantic and returned to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1 mya. Alternatively, this lineage may have spread from the North Pacific to the Arctic and subsequently the North Atlantic during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>.

Pinnipeds have streamlined, spindle-shaped bodies with reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short <a href="snout">snout</a>s and a constricted <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a>. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly shaped by the maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and back <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a>s. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.

Pinnipeds range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and southern elephant seal. Overall, they tend to be larger than other carnivorans; the southern elephant seal is the largest carnivoran. Several species have male-biased sexual dimorphism that correlates with the degree of <a href="Polygyny%20in%20nature">polygyny</a> in a species: highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic, while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly larger than males. Males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have <a href="secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sex characteristic</a>s, such as the prominent <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> of elephant seals, the inflatable red nasal membrane of hooded seals and the thick necks and manes of otariids. Despite a correlation between size dimorphism and the degree of polygyny, some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences and prior to the development of polygyny.

Almost all pinnipeds have fur coats, the exception being the walrus, which is only sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most land mammals. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as <a href="lanugo">lanugo</a>, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically <a href="Countershading">countershaded</a>, and are darker colored <a href="Dorsum%20%28anatomy%29">dorsally</a> and lighter colored <a href="Abdomen">ventrally</a>, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species <a href="molt">molt</a>; phocids molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of <a href="Panniculus%20adiposus">subcutaneous fat</a> known as <a href="blubber">blubber</a> that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are <a href="fasting">fasting</a>. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.

Pinnipeds have a simple stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a <a href="cecum">cecum</a> nor a clear demarcation between the <a href="small%20intestine">small</a> and <a href="large%20intestine">large intestine</a>s; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 times (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds do not have an <a href="appendix%20%28anatomy%29">appendix</a>. As in most marine mammals, the <a href="reniculate%20kidney">kidneys</a> are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.

Pinnipeds have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds tend to be slower swimmers than <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a>s, typically cruising at compared to around for several species of <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>. Seals are more agile and flexible, and some otariids, such as the California sea lion, are capable of bending their necks backwards far enough to reach their hind-flippers, allowing them to make dorsal turns. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of <a href="Muscle%20fascicle">muscle bundles</a> in their skin that may increase <a href="laminar%20flow">laminar flow</a> and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack <a href="Arrector%20pili%20muscle">arrector pili</a>, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim.

When swimming, otariids rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s and <a href="sea%20turtles">sea turtles</a>. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs of otariids are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species <a href="Whale%20surfacing%20behaviour%23Breaching%2C%20lunging%2C%20and%20porpoising">leap</a> out of the water, which may allow then to travel faster. In addition, sea lions are known to "ride" waves, which probably helps them decrease their energy usage.

Pinnipeds can move around on land, though not as well as terrestrial animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can "walk" on all fours. The fore-flippers move in a <a href="Transverse%20plane">transverse</a>, rather than a <a href="Sagittal%20plane">sagittal</a> fashion. Otariids rely on the movements of their heads and necks more than their hind-flippers during terrestrial locomotion. By swinging their heads and necks, otariids create momentum while they are moving. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.

The eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The <a href="lens%20%28anatomy%29">lens</a> is mostly spherical, and much of the <a href="retina">retina</a> is <a href="equidistant">equidistant</a> from the lens center. The <a href="cornea">cornea</a> has a flattened center where <a href="refraction">refraction</a> is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. The well-developed <a href="Iris%20dilator%20muscle">dilator muscle</a> gives the animals a great range in <a href="Pupillary%20response">pupil dilation</a>. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more <a href="diagonal">diagonal</a>. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.

On land, pinnipeds are <a href="Myopia">near-sighted</a> in dim light. This is reduced in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They also have a well-developed "<a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a>", a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the <a href="Rod%20cells">rods</a>. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of <a href="ultraviolet%20radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer <a href="snow%20blindness">snow blindness</a>. Pinnipeds appear to have limited <a href="color%20vision">color vision</a>, as they lack <a href="cone%20cell">S-cones</a>. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The <a href="extraocular%20muscles">extraocular muscles</a> of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of <a href="mucus">mucus</a> to protect their eyes. The <a href="corneal%20epithelium">corneal epithelium</a> is <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized and the <a href="sclera">sclera</a> is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s.

The pinniped ear is adapted for hearing underwater, where it can hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000 <a href="hertz">Hz</a>. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While they are capable of hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000 Hz in the <a href="northern%20fur%20seal">northern fur seal</a>, compared to 20 to 20,000 Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.

Pinnipeds have well-developed <a href="Tactition">tactile</a> senses. Their mystacial <a href="whiskers">vibrissae</a> have ten times the <a href="nerve">innervation</a> of terrestrial mammals, allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the water. These vibrations are generated, for example, when a fish swims through water. Detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging and may add to or even replace vision, particularly in darkness. Harbor seals have been observed following varying paths of another seal that swam ahead several minutes before, similar to a dog following a scent trail, and even to discriminate the species and the size of the fish responsible for the trail. Blind ringed seals have even been observed successfully hunting on their own in <a href="Lake%20Saimaa">Lake Saimaa</a>, likely relying on their vibrissae to gain sensory information and catch prey.

Unlike terrestrial mammals, such as <a href="rodents">rodents</a>, pinnipeds do not move their vibrissae over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and keep them in the same position. By holding their vibrissae steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The vibrissae of phocids are undulated and wavy while otariid and walrus vibrissae are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability. The vibrissa's angle relative to the flow, not the shape, however, seems to be the most important factor. The vibrissae of some otariids grow quite long—those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach . Walruses have the most vibrissae, at 600–700 individual hairs. These are important for detecting their prey on the muddy sea floor. In addition to foraging, vibrissae may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.

Before diving, pinnipeds typically exhale to empty their lungs of half the air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the <a href="vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a>. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous rings</a> and <a href="smooth%20muscle%20tissue">smooth muscle</a>, and <a href="alveoli">alveoli</a> that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains <a href="Sinus%20%28anatomy%29">sinuses</a> that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing <a href="Ear%20clearing">middle ear squeeze</a>. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the <a href="bronchiole">bronchiole</a>s and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a>, <a href="oxygen%20toxicity">oxygen toxicity</a> and <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a>. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a>, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.
The main adaptations of the pinniped <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a> for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins to increase their capacity. <a href="Retia%20mirabilia">Retia mirabilia</a> form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the <a href="thoracic%20cavity">thoracic cavity</a> and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a> and <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a> stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged for long periods of time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have <a href="blood%20volume">blood volume</a>s that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> stable, phocids have an elastic <a href="aorta">aorta</a> that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.

Pinnipeds conserve heat with their large and compact body size, insulating blubber and fur, and high metabolism. In addition, the blood vessels in their flippers are adapted for <a href="countercurrent%20exchange">countercurrent exchange</a>. Veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries, which contain warm blood received from the core of the body. Heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels, which then recirculate blood back to the core. The same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by flipping sand onto their backs, adding a layer of cool, damp sand that enhances heat loss. The northern fur seal <a href="wikt%3Apant">pants</a> to help stay cool, while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest in.

Pinnipeds spend many months at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have recorded them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with <a href="Unihemispheric%20slow-wave%20sleep">half of their brain awake</a> so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.

Living pinnipeds mainly inhabit polar and subpolar regions, particularly the North Atlantic, the North Pacific and the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>. They are entirely absent from <a href="Indomalaya%20ecozone">Indo-Malayan</a> waters. Monk seals and some otariids live in tropical and subtropical waters. Seals usually require cool, nutrient-rich waters with temperatures lower than . Even those that live in warm or tropical climates live in areas that become cold and nutrient rich due to <a href="current%20%28ocean%29">current</a> patterns. Only monk seals live in waters that are not typically cool or rich in nutrients. The Caspian seal and Baikal seal are found in large landlocked bodies of water (the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal respectively).

As a whole, pinnipeds can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats, including <a href="coastal">coastal</a> water, <a href="open%20ocean">open ocean</a>, <a href="brackish%20water">brackish water</a> and even freshwater <a href="lake">lake</a>s and <a href="river">river</a>s. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off <a href="Oceanic%20islands">oceanic island</a>s. The Baikal seal is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the <a href="Baltic%20sea">Baltic sea</a>. In addition, harbor seals may visit <a href="Estuary">estuaries</a>, lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a>, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they <a href="hauling-out">haul out</a> on to sandy and <a href="pebble">pebble</a> beaches, <a href="rocky%20shore">rocky shore</a>s, <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s, <a href="mud%20flat">mud flat</a>s, <a href="tide%20pool">tide pool</a>s and in <a href="sea%20cave">sea cave</a>s. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like <a href="pier">pier</a>s, <a href="Jetty">jettie</a>s, <a href="buoy">buoy</a>s and <a href="oil%20platform">oil platform</a>s. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul out on to both <a href="fast%20ice">fast ice</a> and <a href="drift%20ice">drift ice</a>.

Pinnipeds have an <a href="wikt%3Aamphibious">amphibious</a> lifestyle; they spend most of their lives in the water, but haul out to mate, raise young, molt, rest, <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulate</a> or escape from aquatic predators. Several species are known to <a href="Animal%20migration">migrate</a> vast distances, particularly in response to extreme environmental changes, like <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> or changes in ice cover. <a href="Elephant%20seal">Elephant seal</a>s stay at sea 8–10 months a year and migrate between breeding and molting sites. The northern elephant seal has one of the longest recorded migration distances for a mammal, at . Phocids tend to migrate more than otariids. Traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">geomagnetic fields</a>, water and wind currents, the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the water.

Pinnipeds may dive during foraging or to avoid predators. When foraging, Weddell seals typically dive for less than 15 minutes to depths of around but can dive for as long as 73 minutes and to depths of up to . Northern elephant seals commonly dive for as long as 20 minutes. They can also dive and for as long as 62 minutes. The dives of otariids tend to be shorter and less deep. They typically last 5–7 minutes with average depths to . However, the New Zealand sea lion has been recorded diving to a maximum of and a duration of 12 minutes. Walruses do not often dive very deep, as they feed in shallow water.

Pinnipeds have lifespans averaging 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend to fight and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.

All pinnipeds are <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> and <a href="predatory">predatory</a>. As a whole, they mostly feed on fish and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, followed by <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, and then <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> and <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>ic ("warm-blooded") prey like <a href="sea%20bird">sea bird</a>s. While most species are <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">generalist</a> and opportunistic feeders, a few are specialists. Examples include the <a href="crabeater%20seal">crabeater seal</a>, which primarily eats <a href="krill">krill</a>, the <a href="ringed%20seal">ringed seal</a>, which eats mainly crustaceans, the <a href="Ross%20seal">Ross seal</a> and <a href="southern%20elephant%20seal">southern elephant seal</a>, which specialize on squid, and the <a href="bearded%20seal">bearded seal</a> and <a href="walrus">walrus</a>, which feed on <a href="clam">clam</a>s and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids <a href="cooperative%20hunting">hunt cooperatively</a> in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.

Seals typically consume their prey underwater where it is swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately <a href="Cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cusp</a>ed teeth of <a href="Filter%20feeder">filter-feeding species</a>, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by <a href="suction%20feeding">suction feeding</a>, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may <a href="Gastrolith">swallow stones or pebbles</a> for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.

Pinnipeds themselves are subject to predation. Most species are preyed on by the <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a> or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large <a href="shark">shark</a>s are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the <a href="great%20white%20shark">great white shark</a> but also the <a href="tiger%20shark">tiger shark</a> and <a href="mako%20shark">mako shark</a>. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters. Pinnipeds are also targeted by terrestrial and <a href="pagophilic">pagophilic</a> predators. The <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, <a href="brown%20hyena">brown hyena</a>s and various species of <a href="canid">canid</a>s, which mostly target the young. 
Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.

Interspecific predation among pinnipeds does occur. The leopard seal is known to prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form an important part of their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on <a href="South%20American%20fur%20seal">South American fur seal</a>s.

The <a href="mating%20system">mating system</a> of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to <a href="serial%20monogamy">serial monogamy</a>. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, and the remaining 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.

Other seals, like the walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with copulation usually taking place in the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on drift ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.

Adult male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure <a href="reproductive%20success">reproductive success</a>. Otariids establish <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural breaks in the substrate, and some may be fully or partially underwater. Males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called "maritories" near female haul-out areas. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the ice.

<a href="Lek%20mating">Lek systems</a> are known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with elaborate <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a>s and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance hierarchies</a> with the highest ranking males—the <a href="Alpha%20%28ethology%29">alpha males</a>—maintaining <a href="Harem%20%28zoology%29">harems</a> of as many as 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time, while males of some walrus populations try to monopolize access to female herds. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time, and wait for them to reach estrus.

Younger or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephant seals will sneak into female clusters and try to blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form "gangs" and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with females. Alternative mating strategies also exist in young male grey seals, which do have some success. 

Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate with. When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm and get away, while croaking and slapping him with her tail. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to mate with the female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay in the center of the colony where they are more likely to mate with a dominant male, while peripheral females are more likely to mate with subordinates. Female Steller sea lions are known to solicit mating with their territorial males.

With the exception of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter <a href="estrous">estrous</a> shortly after they give birth. All species go through <a href="delayed%20implantation">delayed implantation</a>, wherein the <a href="embryo">embryo</a> remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the <a href="uterus">uterus</a>. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place in the spring and summer months. Typically, single pups are born; twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born <a href="precocial">precocial</a>.
Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no <a href="lactose">lactose</a>. Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period–four days for the hooded seal and five weeks for elephant seals. The milk of these species consist of up to 60% <a href="fat">fat</a>, allowing the young to grow fairly quickly. In particular, northern elephant seal pups gain each day before they are weaned. Some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others. <a href="Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> occurs in these fasting species; while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.

For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20fur%20seal">Galápagos fur seal</a> it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.

Male pinnipeds generally play little role in raising the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young as they learn to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats to the safety of pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.

Pinnipeds can produce a number of vocalizations such as barks, grunts, rasps, rattles, growls, creaks, warbles, trills, chirps, chugs, clicks and whistles. Vocals are produced both in air and underwater. Otariids are more vocal on land, while phocids are more vocal in water. Antarctic seals are more vocal on land or ice than Arctic seals due to a lack of terrestrial and pagophliic predators like the polar bear. Male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the females. Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with "clap-threats" and loud drum-like calls that may be <a href="Vocal%20resonation">modified</a> by the proboscis. Male otariids have strong barks, growls, roars and "whickers". Male walruses are known to produce distinctive <a href="gong">gong</a>-like calls when attempting to attract females. They can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated throats.

The Weddell seal has perhaps the most elaborate vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater contexts. Underwater vocals include trills, chugs, chirps, chugs and knocks. The calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a message. The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to <a href="bird%20vocalization">birdsongs</a> and <a href="whale%20vocalization">whalesongs</a>. Similar calls have been recorded in other lobodontine seals and in bearded seals. In some pinniped species, there appear to be geographic differences in vocalizations, known as <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, while certain species may even have individual variations in expression. These differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Otariid females and their young use <a href="contact%20call">mother-pup attraction calls</a> to help them reunite when the mother returns from foraging at sea. The calls are described are "loud" and "bawling". Female elephant seals make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young. When threatened by other adults or when pups try to suckle, females make a harsh, pulsed call. Pups may also vocalize when playing, in distress or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. While most vocals are audible to the human ear, a captive leopard seal was recorded making <a href="Ultrasound">ultrasonic</a> calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce <a href="infrasonic">infrasonic</a> vibrations. 

Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.

In a <a href="match-to-sample%20task">match-to-sample task</a> study, a single California sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry, transitivity and equivalence; a second seal was unable to complete the tasks. They demonstrate the ability to understand simple <a href="syntax">syntax</a> and commands when taught an artificial <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a>, though they only rarely used the signs <a href="semantics">semantically</a> or logically. In 2011, a captive California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms. This "rhythmic entrainment" was previously seen only in humans, <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s and other birds possessing <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocal mimicry</a>. In 1971, a captive harbor seal named <a href="Hoover%20%28seal%29">Hoover</a> was trained to imitate human words, phrases and laughter. For sea lions used in entertainment, trainers toss a ball at the animal so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining an understanding of the behavior desired. It may require a year to train a sea lion to perform a trick for the public. Its long-term memory allows it to perform a trick after at least three months of non-performance.

Various human cultures have for millennia depicted pinnipeds. The anthropologist, A. Asbjørn Jøn, has analysed beliefs of the <a href="Celt">Celt</a>s of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a> who believed in <a href="selkie">selkie</a>s—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance in the <a href="Inuit%20culture">culture</a> of the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>. In <a href="Inuit%20mythology">Inuit mythology</a>, the goddess <a href="Sedna%20%28mythology%29">Sedna</a> rules over the sea and marine animals. She is depicted as a <a href="mermaid">mermaid</a>, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, <a href="whale">whale</a>s and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20coinage">Ancient Greek coins</a> depicts the head of a seal, and the animals were mentioned by <a href="Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. The Greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. The <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> people of <a href="ancient%20Peru">ancient Peru</a> worshipped the sea and its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern culture, pinnipeds are thought of as cute, playful and comical figures.

Pinnipeds can be found in facilities around the world, as their large size and playfulness make them popular attractions. Seals have been kept in captivity since at least <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a> and their trainability was noticed by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>. Zoologist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> noted during the 19th century that wild seals show considerable fondness for humans and stated that they are second only to some <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s among wild animals in their easily tamability. <a href="Francis%20Galton">Francis Galton</a> noted in his landmark paper on domestication that seals were a spectacular example of an animal that would most likely never be domesticated despite their friendliness and desire for comfort due to the fact that they serve no practical use for humans. 

Some modern exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out sites and a pool, while others have pens with small rocky, elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the California sea lion as it is both easy to train and adaptable. Other species popularly kept include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common. Some organizations, such as the <a href="Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">Humane Society of the United States</a> and <a href="World%20Animal%20Protection">World Animal Protection</a>, object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also state that the tricks performed for audiences are "exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors" and distract the people from the animal's unnatural environment. Less entertainment-oriented zoos may still encourage animal play by throwing fish at animals in different directions and providing play equipment.

California sea lions are used in <a href="Military%20animal">military applications</a> by the <a href="U.S.%20Navy%20Marine%20Mammal%20Program">U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program</a>, including detecting <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s and enemy divers. In the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the animals have been trained to swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a <a href="Clamp%20%28tool%29">clamp</a> with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like <a href="PETA">PETA</a> believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.

Humans have hunted seals since the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>. Originally, seals were hit with clubs during haul-out. Eventually, seal hunters used <a href="harpoon">harpoon</a>s to spear the animals from boats out at sea, and hooks for killing pups on ice or land. They were also trapped in nets. The use of firearms in seal hunting during the <a href="modern%20era">modern era</a> drastically increased the number of killings. Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber. The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into <a href="Fur%20clothing">coats</a>, and the tusks of walruses continue to be used for carvings or as ornaments. There is a distinction between the subsistence hunting of seals by <a href="Circumpolar%20peoples">indigenous peoples of the Arctic</a> and commercial hunting: subsistence hunters typically use seal products for themselves and depend on them for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as indigenous people are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling seal products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term "subsistence" should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption. More than 100,000 phocids (especially ringed seals) as well as around 10,000 walruses are harvested annually by native hunters.
Commercial sealing was historically just as important an industry as <a href="whaling">whaling</a>. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on <a href="Guadalupe%20Island">Guadalupe Island</a>. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a <a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a>. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.

Several species of pinniped continue to be harvested. The <a href="Convention%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Antarctic%20Seals">Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals</a> allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.

The Caribbean monk seal has been killed and exploited by Europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, <a href="turtling%20%28hunting%29">turtle hunters</a> and <a href="buccaneer">buccaneer</a>s because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus "<a href="Island%20tameness">genetically tame</a>". In the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. In the mid-nineteenth century, the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> in 1886. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996. The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands, but <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s. The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974.

As of 2013, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) recognizes 35 pinniped species. With the Japanese sea lion and the <a href="Caribbean%20monk%20seal">Caribbean monk seal</a> recently extinct, ten more are considered at risk, as they are ranked "<a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>" (the Mediterranean and Hawaiian monk seals), "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" (Galápagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, Caspian seal and Galápagos sea lion), and "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" (northern fur seal, hooded seal and New Zealand sea lion). Three species—the walrus, the ribbon seal, and the spotted seal—have a "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" ranking. Species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of recent and ongoing <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, particularly declines in sea ice. There has been some debate over the cause of the decline of Steller sea lions in Alaska since the 1970s.

Some species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the <a href="Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act%20of%201972">Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972</a> (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000 . These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from <a href="salmon%20run">salmon run</a>s at <a href="Bonneville%20Dam">Bonneville Dam</a>. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing <a href="Oncorhynchus">Pacific Northwest salmon</a> populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using <a href="bomb">bomb</a>s, <a href="rubber%20bullet">rubber bullet</a>s and <a href="Bean%20bag%20round">bean bags</a>. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric dams</a> pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be <a href="Culling">culled</a>, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.

Pinnipeds are also threatened by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in <a href="fishing%20net">fishing net</a>s by <a href="commercial%20fisheries">commercial fisheries</a> and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. <a href="Gillnetting">Gillnetting</a> and <a href="Seine%20fishing">Seine netting</a> is a significant cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>. High levels of <a href="Persistent%20organic%20pollutant">organic chemical</a>s accumulate in these animals since they are near the top of <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>s and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause <a href="gastrointestinal%20cancer">gastrointestinal cancer</a>s, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.

Steller's sea cow

Steller's sea cow ("Hydrodamalis gigas") is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="sirenia">sirenia</a>n discovered by Europeans in 1741. At that time, it was found only around the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a> in the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a> between Alaska and Russia; its range was more extensive during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a>, and it is possible that the animal and humans previously interacted. Some 18th-century adults would have reached weights of and lengths up to .

It was a part of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Sirenia">Sirenia</a> and a member of the family <a href="Dugongidae">Dugongidae</a>, of which its closest living relative, the long <a href="dugong">dugong</a> ("Dugong dugon"), is the sole surviving member. It had a thicker layer of <a href="blubber">blubber</a> than other members of the order, an adaptation to the cold waters of its environment. Its <a href="Cetacea%23Fluke">tail was forked</a>, like that of <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. Lacking true teeth, it had an array of white bristles on its upper lip and two <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous plates within its mouth for chewing. It fed mainly on <a href="kelp">kelp</a>, and communicated with sighs and snorting sounds. Evidence suggests it was a <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> and <a href="social%20animal">social animal</a> living in small family groups and <a href="parental%20investment">raising its young</a>, similar to <a href="extant%20species">extant</a> sirenians.

Steller's sea cow was named after <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Steller">Georg Wilhelm Steller</a>, a <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> who discovered the <a href="species">species</a> in 1741 on <a href="Vitus%20Bering">Vitus Bering's</a> <a href="Great%20Northern%20Expedition">Great Northern Expedition</a> when the crew became shipwrecked on <a href="Bering%20Island">Bering Island</a>. Much of what is known about its behavior comes from Steller's observations on the island, documented in his posthumous publication "On the Beasts of the Sea". Within 27 years of discovery by Europeans, the slow-moving and easily caught mammal was hunted into extinction for its meat, fat, and hide.

Steller's sea cows grew to be long as adults, much larger than <a href="extant%20species">extant</a> <a href="sirenia">sirenia</a>ns. <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Steller">Georg Steller's</a> writings contain two contradictory estimates of weight: . The true value is estimated to fall between these figures, at about . This size made the sea cow one of the largest <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s of the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a>, along with <a href="whale">whale</a>s. The sea cow's large size was likely an adaptation to reduce its <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">surface area-to-volume ratio</a> and conserve heat. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's sea cow was positively <a href="buoyancy">buoyant</a>, meaning that it was unable to completely submerge. It had a very thick <a href="epidermis">outer skin</a>, , to prevent injury from sharp rocks and ice and possibly to prevent unsubmerged skin from drying out. The sea cow's <a href="blubber">blubber</a> was thick, another adaptation to the frigid climate of the Bering Sea. Its skin was brownish-black, with white patches on some individuals. It was smooth along its back and rough on its sides, with crater-like depressions most likely caused by <a href="ectoparasite">parasite</a>s. This rough texture led to the animal's being nicknamed the "bark animal". Hair on its body was sparse, but the insides of the sea cow's <a href="flipper%20%28anatomy%29">flippers</a> were covered in bristles. The fore limbs were roughly long, and the tail fluke was forked.

The sea cow's head was small and short in comparison to its huge body. The animal's upper lip was large and broad, extending so far beyond the <a href="mandible">lower jaw</a> that the mouth appeared to be located underneath the skull. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's sea cow was toothless and instead had a dense array of interlacing white bristles on its upper lip. The bristles were about in length and were used to tear <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> stalks and hold food. The sea cow also had two <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous plates located on its <a href="palate">palate</a> and <a href="mandible">mandible</a>, used for chewing. According to Steller, these plates (or "masticatory pads") were held together by <a href="interdental%20papilla">interdental papilla</a>e, a part of the <a href="gums">gums</a>, and had many small holes containing <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s and <a href="artery">arteries</a>.

As with all sirenians, the sea cow's <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">snout</a> pointed downwards, which allowed it to better grasp <a href="kelp">kelp</a>. The sea cow's nostrils were roughly long and wide. In addition to those within its mouth, the sea cow also had stiff bristles long protruding from its muzzle. Steller's sea cow had small eyes located halfway between its nostrils and ears with black <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>, <a href="wikt%3Alivid">livid</a> eyeballs, and <a href="canthus">canthi</a> which were not externally visible. The animal had no eyelashes, but like other diving creatures such as <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a>s, Steller's sea cow had a <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>, which covered its eyes to prevent injury while feeding. The tongue was small and remained in the back of the mouth, unable to reach the masticatory (chewing) pads.

The sea cow's spine is believed to have had seven <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a> (neck), 17 <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic</a>, three <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar</a>, and 34 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Its <a href="rib">rib</a>s were large, with five of 17 pairs making contact with the <a href="sternum">sternum</a>; it had no <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a>s. As in all sirenians, the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> of Steller's sea cow was fan-shaped, being larger on the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">posterior</a> side and narrower towards the neck. The anterior border of the scapula was nearly straight, whereas those of modern sirenians are curved. Like other sirenians, the bones of Steller's sea cow were <a href="pachyosteosclerosis">pachyosteosclerotic</a>, meaning they were both bulky (<a href="pachyostotic">pachyostotic</a>) and dense (<a href="osteosclerotic">osteosclerotic</a>). In all collected skeletons of the sea cow, the <a href="manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> is missing; since "<a href="Dusisiren">Dusisiren</a>"—the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> of "<a href="Hydrodamalis">Hydrodamalis</a>"—had reduced <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a> (finger bones), Steller's sea cow possibly did not have a manus at all.

The sea cow's <a href="heart">heart</a> was in weight; its <a href="stomach">stomach</a> measured long and wide. The full length of its <a href="intestinal%20tract">intestinal tract</a> was about , equaling more than 20 times the animal's length. The sea cow had no <a href="gallbladder">gallbladder</a>, but did have a wide <a href="common%20bile%20duct">common bile duct</a>. Its anus was in width, with its <a href="feces">feces</a> resembling those of horses. The male's <a href="penis">penis</a> was long.

Whether Steller's sea cow had any natural <a href="predation">predators</a> is unknown. It may have been hunted by <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a>s and <a href="shark">shark</a>s, though its buoyancy may have made it difficult for killer whales to drown, and the rocky <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a>s in which the sea cow lived may have deterred sharks. According to Steller, the adults guarded the young from predators.

Steller described an <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a> on the sea cows that was similar to the <a href="whale%20louse">whale louse</a> ("Cyamus ovalis"), but the parasite remains unidentified due to the <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host's</a> extinction and loss of all original specimens collected by Steller. It was first formally described as "Sirenocyamus rhytinae" in 1846 by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Johann Friedrich von Brandt</a>. It was the only species of cyamid <a href="amphipoda">amphipod</a> to be reported inhabiting a sirenian. Steller also identified an <a href="endoparasite">endoparasite</a> on the sea cows, which was likely an <a href="Ascarididae">ascarid nematode</a>.

Like other sirenians, Steller's sea cow was an obligate <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a> and spent most of the day feeding, only lifting its head every 4–5 minutes for breathing. Kelp was its main food source, making it an <a href="algivore">algivore</a>. The sea cow likely fed on several species of kelp, which have been identified as "<a href="List%20of%20brown%20algal%20genera%23Costariaceae">Agarum</a>" spp., "<a href="Alaria%20%28alga%29">Alaria praelonga</a>", "<a href="Analipus">Halosaccion glandiforme</a>", "<a href="Laminaria%20saccharina">Laminaria saccharina</a>", "<a href="Nereocystis">Nereocyctis luetkeana</a>", and "<a href="List%20of%20brown%20algal%20genera%23Costariaceae">Thalassiophyllum clathrus</a>". Steller's sea cow only fed directly on the soft parts of the kelp, which caused the tougher stem and <a href="holdfast">holdfast</a> to wash up on the shore in heaps. The sea cow may have also fed on <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a>, but the plant was not common enough to support a <a href="Minimum%20viable%20population">viable population</a> and could not have been the sea cow's primary food source. Further, the available seagrasses in the sea cow's range ("<a href="Phyllospadix">Phyllospadix</a>" spp. and "<a href="Zostera%20marina">Zostera marina</a>") may have grown too deep underwater or been too tough for the animal to consume. Since the sea cow floated, it likely fed on <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> kelp, as it is believed to have only had access to food no deeper than below the tide. Kelp releases a <a href="Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory%23Chemical%20defenses">chemical deterrent</a> to protect it from grazing, but canopy kelp releases a lower concentration of the chemical, allowing the sea cow to graze safely. Steller noted that the sea cow grew thin during the frigid winters, indicating a period of <a href="fasting">fasting</a> due to low kelp growth. Fossils of <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Island</a> sea cow populations were larger than those from the Commander Islands, indicating that the growth of Commander Island sea cows may have been <a href="stunted%20growth">stunted</a> due to a less favorable habitat and less food than the warmer Aleutian Islands.
Steller described the sea cow as being highly social (<a href="social%20animal">gregarious</a>). It lived in small family groups and helped injured members, and was also apparently <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a>. Steller's sea cow may have exhibited <a href="Parental%20investment">parental care</a>, and the young were kept at the front of the herd for protection against predators. Steller reported that as a female was being captured, a group of other sea cows attacked the hunting boat by ramming and rocking it, and after the hunt, her mate followed the boat to shore, even after the captured animal had died. Mating season occurred in early spring and <a href="pregnancy%20%28mammals%29">gestation</a> took a little over a year, with calves likely delivered in autumn, as Steller observed a greater number of calves in autumn than at any other time of the year. Since female sea cows had only one set of <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s, they likely had one calf at a time.

The sea cow used its fore limbs for swimming, feeding, walking in shallow water, defending itself, and holding on to its partner during copulation. According to Steller, the fore limbs were also used to anchor the sea cow down to prevent it from being swept away by the strong <a href="Littoral%20zone">nearshore</a> waves. While grazing, the sea cow progressed slowly by moving its tail (fluke) from side to side; more rapid movement was achieved by strong vertical beating of the tail. They often slept on their backs after feeding. According to Steller, the sea cow was nearly mute and made only heavy breathing sounds, raspy snorting similar to a horse, and sighs.

Steller's sea cow was a member of the <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">genus</a> "<a href="Hydrodamalis">Hydrodamalis</a>", a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was "<a href="Dusisiren">Dusisiren</a>". Like those of Steller's sea cow, the ancestors of "Dusisiren" lived in tropical <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s before adapting to the cold climates of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">North Pacific</a>. "Hydrodamalis" and "Dusisiren" are classified together in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">subfamily</a> <a href="Hydrodamalinae">Hydrodamalinae</a>, which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>. Steller's sea cow is a member of the family <a href="Dugongidae">Dugongidae</a>, the sole surviving member of which, and thus Steller's sea cow's closest living relative, is the <a href="dugong">dugong</a> ("Dugong dugon").

Steller's sea cow was a direct descendant of the <a href="Cuesta%20sea%20cow">Cuesta sea cow</a> ("H. cuestae"), an extinct tropical sea cow that lived off the coast of western North America, particularly California. The Cuesta sea cow is thought to have become extinct due to the onset of the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a> and the subsequent cooling of the oceans. Many populations died out, but the lineage of Steller's sea cow was able to adapt to the colder temperatures. The <a href="Takikawa%20sea%20cow">Takikawa sea cow</a> ("H. spissa") of Japan is thought of by some researchers to be a <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a> of the Cuesta sea cow, but based on a comparison of <a href="endocast">endocast</a>s, the Takikawa and Steller's sea cows are more <a href="synapomorphy">derived</a> than the Cuesta sea cow. This has led some to believe that the Takikawa sea cow is its own species. The evolution of the genus "Hydrodamalis" was characterized by increased size, and a loss of teeth and <a href="phalanx%20bone">phalanges</a>, as a response to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation.

Steller's sea cow was discovered in 1741 by Georg Wilhelm Steller, and was named after him. Steller researched the wildlife of <a href="Bering%20Island">Bering Island</a> while he was shipwrecked there for about a year; the animals on the island included <a href="relict%20%28biology%29">relict</a> populations of sea cows, sea otters, <a href="Steller%20sea%20lion">Steller sea lion</a>s, and <a href="northern%20fur%20seal">northern fur seal</a>s. Steller's account was included in his posthumous publication "De bestiis marinis", or "The Beasts of the Sea", which was published in 1751 by the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Zoologist Eberhard von Zimmermann formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> Stellar's sea cow in 1780 as "Manati gigas". Biologist <a href="Anders%20Jahan%20Retzius">Anders Jahan Retzius</a> in 1794 put the sea cow in the new genus "Hydrodamalis", with the specific name of "stelleri", in honor of Steller. In 1811, naturalist <a href="Johann%20Karl%20Wilhelm%20Illiger">Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</a> reclassified Steller's sea cow into the genus "Rytina", which many writers at the time adopted. The name "Hydrodamalis gigas", the correct "<a href="combinatio%20nova">combinatio nova</a>" if a separate genus is recognised, was first used in 1895 by <a href="Theodore%20Sherman%20Palmer">Theodore Sherman Palmer</a>.
For decades after its discovery, no skeletal remains of a Steller's sea cow were discovered. This may have been due to rising and falling sea levels over the course of the Quaternary period, which could have left many sea cow bones hidden. The first bones of a Steller's sea cow were unearthed in about 1840, over 70 years after it was presumed extinct. The first partial sea cow skull was discovered in 1844 by <a href="Ilya%20Voznesensky">Ilya Voznesensky</a> while on the Commander Islands, and the first skeleton was discovered in 1855 on northern Bering Island. These specimens were sent to Saint Petersburg in 1857, and another nearly complete skeleton arrived in Moscow around 1860. Until recently, all the full skeletons were found during the 19th century, being the most productive period in terms of unearthed skeletal remains, from 1878 to 1883. During this time, 12 of the 22 skeletons having known dates of collection were discovered. Some authors did not believe possible the recovery of further significant skeletal material from the Commander Islands after this period, but a skeleton was found in 1983, and two zoologists collected about 90 bones in 1991. Only two to four skeletons of the sea cow exhibited in different museums of the world originate from a single individual. It is known that <a href="Adolf%20Erik%20Nordenski%C3%B6ld">Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld</a>, <a href="Benedykt%20Dybowski">Benedykt Dybowski</a>, and <a href="Leonhard%20Hess%20Stejneger">Leonhard Hess Stejneger</a> unearthed many skeletal remains from different individuals in the late 1800s, from which composite skeletons were assembled. As of 2006, 27 nearly complete skeletons and 62 complete skulls have been found, but most of them are assemblages of bones from two to 16 different individuals.

Sea cow bones are found regularly on the Commander Islands, but to find a full skeleton of the Steller's sea cow is an extremely rare event. However, in November 2017, during regular monitoring of the coastal line Marina Shitova, researchers of the Commander Islands Nature and Biosphere Reserve found a new skeleton of this animal. The skeleton was at a depth of and consisted of 45 spinal bones, 27 ribs, a left shoulder blade, shoulder and forearm bones and several wrist bones. There was no skull, cervical spine, first and second dorsal vertebrae, several caudal vertebrae, the right part of the pectoral arch, or metacarpus and phalangeal bones of the left limb. The total length of the skeleton was . Taking into account the length of the absent part of the spine and the head it was assumed that the animal was about long. The last full skeleton of this animal (about 3 meters i.e. 9.8 ft long), was also found on Bering Island in 1987 and is now in the Aleutian Museum of Natural History at <a href="Nikolskoye%2C%20Kamchatka%20Krai">Nikolskoye</a>.

The Pallas Picture is the only known drawing of Steller's sea cow believed to be from an actual specimen. It was published by <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> in his 1840 work "Icones ad Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica". Pallas did not specify a source; Stejneger suggested it may have been one of the original illustrations produced by Friedrich Plenisner, a member of <a href="Vitus%20Bering">Vitus Bering</a>'s crew as a painter and surveyor who drew a figure of a female sea cow on Steller's request. Most of Plenisner's depictions were lost during transit from Siberia to Saint Petersburg.

Another drawing of Steller's sea cow similar to the Pallas Picture appeared on a 1744 map drawn by Sven Waxell and Sofron Chitrow. The picture may have also been based upon a specimen, and was published in 1893 by Pekarski. The map depicted Vitus Bering's route during the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Expedition">Great Northern Expedition</a>, and featured illustrations of Steller's sea cow and Steller's sea lion in the upper-left corner. The drawing contains some inaccurate features such as the inclusion of eyelids and fingers, leading to doubt that it was drawn from a specimen.

<a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Johann Friedrich von Brandt</a>, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences, had the "Ideal Image" drawn in 1846 based upon the Pallas Picture, and then the "Ideal Picture" in 1868 based upon collected skeletons. Two other possible drawings of Steller's sea cow were found in 1891 in Waxell's manuscript diary. There was a map depicting a sea cow, as well as a Steller sea lion and a northern fur seal. The sea cow was depicted with large eyes, a large head, claw-like hands, exaggerated folds on the body, and a tail fluke in perspective lying horizontally rather than vertically. The drawing may have been a distorted depiction of a juvenile, as the figure bears a resemblance to a <a href="manatee">manatee</a> calf. Another similar image was found by <a href="Alexander%20von%20Middendorff">Alexander von Middendorff</a> in 1867 in the library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and is probably a copy of the Tsarskoye Selo Picture.

The range of Steller's sea cow at the time of its discovery was apparently restricted to the shallow seas around the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a>, which include Bering and <a href="Medny%20Island">Copper</a> Islands. The Commander Islands remained uninhabited until 1825 when the <a href="Russian-American%20Company">Russian-American Company</a> relocated <a href="Aleut">Aleut</a>s from <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu Island</a> and <a href="Atka%20Island">Atka Island</a> there. The first <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s discovered outside the Commander Islands were found in <a href="interglacial">interglacial</a> Pleistocene deposits in <a href="Amchitka">Amchitka</a>, and further fossils dating to the late Pleistocene were found in <a href="Monterey%20Bay">Monterey Bay</a>, California, and <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>, Japan. This suggests that the sea cow had a far more extensive range in prehistoric times. It cannot be excluded that these fossils belong to other "Hydrodamalis" species. The southernmost find is a <a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> rib bone from the <a href="B%C5%8Ds%C5%8D%20Peninsula">Bōsō Peninsula</a> of Japan. The remains of three individuals were found preserved in the <a href="South%20Bight%20Formation">South Bight Formation</a> of Amchitka; as late Pleistocene interglacial deposits are rare in the Aleutians, the discovery suggests that sea cows were abundant in that era. According to Steller, the sea cow often resided in the shallow, sandy shorelines and in the mouths of freshwater rivers.

Bone fragments and accounts by native Aleut people suggest that sea cows also historically inhabited the <a href="Near%20Islands">Near Islands</a>, potentially with viable populations that were in contact with humans in the western <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> prior to Steller's discovery in 1741. A sea cow rib discovered in 1998 on <a href="Kiska%20Island">Kiska Island</a> was <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">dated</a> to around 1,000 years old, and is now in the possession of the <a href="Burke%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20and%20Culture">Burke Museum</a> in Seattle. The dating may be skewed due to the marine reservoir effect which causes radiocarbon-dated marine specimens to appear several hundred years older than they are. Marine reservoir effect is caused by the large reserves of <a href="carbon-14">C</a> in the ocean, and it is more likely that the animal died between 1710 and 1785.

A 2004 study reported that sea cow bones discovered on <a href="Adak%20Island">Adak Island</a> were around 1,700 years old, and sea cow bones discovered on <a href="Buldir%20Island">Buldir Island</a> were found to be around 1,600 years old. It is possible the bones were from cetaceans and were misclassified. Rib bones of a Steller's sea cow have also been found on <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20Island">St. Lawrence Island</a>, and the specimen is thought to have lived between 800 and 920 <a href="Current%20Era">CE</a>.

Steller's sea cow was quickly wiped out by <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs, <a href="seal%20hunting">seal hunters</a>, and others who followed Vitus Bering's route past its habitat to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. It was also hunted to collect its valuable <a href="subcutaneous%20tissue">subcutaneous fat</a>. The animal was hunted and used by Ivan Krassilnikov in 1754 and Ivan Korovin 1762, but Dimitri Bragin in 1772 and others later did not see it. Brandt thus concluded that by 1768, twenty-seven years after it had been discovered by Europeans, the species was extinct. In 1887 Stejneger estimated that there had been fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining at the time of Steller's discovery, and argued there was already an immediate danger of the sea cow's extinction.

The first attempt to hunt the animal by Steller and the other crew members was unsuccessful due to its strength and thick hide. They had attempted to impale it and haul it to shore using a large hook and heavy cable, but the crew could not pierce its skin. In a second attempt a month later a <a href="harpoon">harpoon</a>er speared an animal, and men on shore hauled it in while others repeatedly stabbed it with <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s. It was dragged into shallow waters, and the crew waited until the tide receded and it was beached to butcher it. After this, they were hunted with relative ease, the challenge being in hauling the animal back to shore. This bounty inspired <a href="maritime%20fur%20trade">maritime fur trade</a>rs to detour to the Commander Islands and restock their food supplies during North Pacific expeditions.

The presence of Steller's sea cows in the Aleutian Islands may have caused the Aleut people to migrate westward to hunt them. This possibly led to the sea cow's extinction in that area, assuming the animals survived in that region into the Holocene epoch, but there is no archaeological evidence.

It has also been argued that the decline of Steller's sea cow may have been an indirect effect of the harvesting of sea otters by the area's aboriginal people. With the otter population reduced, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a> population would have increased, in turn reducing the stock of kelp, its principal food. In historic times, though, aboriginal hunting had depleted sea otter populations only in localized areas, and as the sea cow would have been easy prey for aboriginal hunters, accessible populations may have been exterminated with or without simultaneous otter hunting. In any event, the range of the sea cow was limited to coastal areas off uninhabited islands by the time Bering arrived, and the animal was already <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>.

One factor potentially leading to extinction of Steller's sea cow, specifically off the coast of St. Lawrence Island, was the <a href="Siberian%20Yupik%20people">Siberian Yupik people</a> who have inhabited St. Lawrence island for 2,000 years. They may have hunted the sea cows into extinction, as the natives have a dietary culture heavily dependent upon <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s. The onset of the <a href="Medieval%20Warm%20Period">Medieval Warm Period</a> which reduced the availability of kelp may have also been the cause for their <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a> in that area.

Sea cow sightings have been reported after Brandt's official 1768 date of extinction. <a href="Lucien%20M.%20Turner">Lucien Turner</a>, an American <a href="ethnologist">ethnologist</a> and naturalist, said the natives of <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu Island</a> reported that the sea cows survived into the 1800s, and were sometimes hunted.

In 1963 the official journal of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20the%20USSR">Academy of Sciences of the USSR</a> published an article announcing a possible sighting. The previous year, the <a href="whaling%20ship">whaling ship</a> "Buran" had reported a group of large marine mammals grazing on seaweed in shallow water off <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a>, in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Anadyr">Gulf of Anadyr</a>. The crew reported seeing six of these animals ranging from , with trunks and split lips. There have also been alleged sightings by local fishermen in the northern <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a>, and around the Kamchatka and <a href="Chukchi%20Peninsula">Chukchi</a> peninsulas.

Steller's sea cow was described as being "tasty" by Steller; the meat was said to have a taste similar to <a href="corned%20beef">corned beef</a>, though it was tougher, redder, and needed to be cooked longer. The meat was abundant on the animal, and slow to spoil, perhaps due the high amount of salt in the animal's diet effectively <a href="Curing%20%28food%20preservation%29%23Salt">curing</a> it. The fat could be used for cooking and as an odorless lamp oil. The thick, sweet milk of female sea cows could be drunk or made into butter, and the thick, leathery hide could be used to make clothing, such as shoes and belts, and large skin boats sometimes called <a href="baidarka">baidarka</a>s or <a href="umiak">umiak</a>s.

Towards the end of the 19th century, bones and fossils from the extinct animal were valuable and often sold to museums at high prices. Most were collected during this time, limiting trade after 1900. Some are still sold commercially, as the highly dense <a href="Bone%23Cortical%20bone">cortical bone</a> is well-suited for making items such as knife handles and decorative carvings. Because the sea cow is extinct, native artisan products made in Alaska from this "mermaid ivory" are legal to sell in the United States and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act">Marine Mammal Protection Act</a> (MMPA) or the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES), which restrict the trade of marine mammal products. Although the distribution is legal, the sale of unfossilized bones is generally prohibited and trade in products made of the bones is regulated because some of the material is unlikely to be authentic and probably comes from <a href="List%20of%20Arctic%20cetaceans">arctic cetaceans</a>.

The <a href="ethnographer">ethnographer</a> Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova, from the <a href="Russian%20Museum%20of%20Ethnography">Russian Museum of Ethnography</a>, was working on the Commander Island Aleuts from August to September 1961. Her research includes notes about a game of accuracy, called "kakan"–meaning "stones"–played with the bones of the Steller's sea cow. Kakan was usually played at home between adults during bad weather, at least during Orlova's fieldwork.

In the story "The White Seal" from "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Book">The Jungle Book</a>" by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, which takes place in the Bering Sea, Kotick the rare <a href="Leucism">white</a> <a href="northern%20fur%20seal">seal</a> consults Sea Cow during his journey to find a new home.

"Tales of a Sea Cow" is a 2012 <a href="docufiction">docufiction</a> film by Icelandic-French artist <a href="Etienne%20de%20France">Etienne de France</a> about a fictional 2006 discovery of Steller's sea cows off the coast of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. The film has been exhibited in art museums and universities in Europe.

Steller's sea cows appear in two books of poetry: "<a href="Nach%20der%20Natur">Nach der Natur</a>" (1995) by <a href="Winfried%20Georg%20Sebald">Winfried Georg Sebald</a>, and "<a href="Species%20Evanescens">Species Evanescens</a>" (2009) by Russian poet <a href="Andrei%20Bronnikov">Andrei Bronnikov</a>. Bronnikov's book depicts the events of the Great Northern Expedition through the eyes of Steller; Sebald's book looks at the conflict between man and nature, including the extinction of Steller's sea cow.

Leslie Groves

<a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> Leslie Richard Groves Jr. (17 August 1896 – 13 July 1970) was a <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a> <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> who oversaw the construction of <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> and directed the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, a <a href="top%20secret">top secret</a> research project that developed the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The son of a U.S. Army <a href="Military%20chaplain">chaplain</a>, Groves lived at various Army posts during his childhood. In 1918, he graduated fourth in his class at the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">U.S. Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point</a> and was commissioned into the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>. In 1929, he went to <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> as part of an expedition to conduct a survey for the <a href="Inter-Oceanic%20Nicaragua%20Canal">Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal</a>. Following the <a href="1931%20Nicaragua%20earthquake">1931 earthquake</a>, Groves took over <a href="Managua">Managua</a>'s water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20School">Command and General Staff School</a> at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, in 1935 and 1936; and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20War%20College">Army War College</a> in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> <a href="General%20Staff">General Staff</a>. Groves developed "a reputation as a doer, a driver, and a stickler for duty" and in 1940 he became special assistant for construction to the <a href="Quartermaster%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Quartermaster General</a>, tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress. In August 1941, he was appointed to create the gigantic office complex for the War Department's 40,000 staff that would ultimately become the Pentagon.

In September 1942, Groves took charge of the Manhattan Project. He was involved in most aspects of the atomic bomb's development: he participated in the selection of sites for research and production at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>; <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>; and <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford, Washington</a>. He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical decisions on the various methods of isotope separation, acquired raw materials, directed the collection of <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a> on the <a href="German%20nuclear%20energy%20project">German nuclear energy project</a> and helped select the cities in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> that were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project in security but failed to prevent the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> from conducting a successful <a href="atomic%20spies">espionage</a> program that stole some of its most important secrets.

After the war, Groves remained in charge of the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> in 1947. He then headed the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a>, which had been created to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Army Chief of Staff</a>, <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, and told that he would never be appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a> just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity nuclear test</a>. He went on to become a vice-president at <a href="Sperry%20Rand">Sperry Rand</a>.

Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four children of a <a href="pastor">pastor</a>, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. He was half Welsh and half English, with some French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestors who came to the United States in the 17th century. Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church in Albany in December 1896 to become a <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a>. He was posted to the <a href="14th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">14th Infantry</a> at <a href="Vancouver%20Barracks">Vancouver Barracks</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> in 1897. Following the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> with the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">8th Infantry</a>. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>; service in the <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">Philippine–American War</a> and the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to <a href="Fort%20Snelling">Fort Snelling</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to <a href="Fort%20Hancock%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fort Hancock</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at <a href="Fort%20Bayard%20Historic%20District">Fort Bayard</a> in 1905. He decided to settle in southern <a href="California">California</a> and bought a house in <a href="Altadena%2C%20California">Altadena</a>. His next posting was to <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Indian%20Reservation">Fort Apache</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.

In 1911, Chaplain Groves was ordered to return to the 14th Infantry, which was now stationed at <a href="Fort%20William%20Henry%20Harrison">Fort William Henry Harrison</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. At Fort Harrison, Groves met Grace (Boo) Wilson, the daughter of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Richard Hulbert Wilson, a career Army officer who had served with Chaplain Groves during the 8th Infantry's posting to Cuba. In 1913, the 14th Infantry moved once more, this time to <a href="Fort%20Lawton">Fort Lawton</a> in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington. Groves entered <a href="Queen%20Anne%20High%20School%20%28Seattle%2C%20Washington%29">Queen Anne High School</a> in 1913, and graduated in 1914. While completing high school, Groves also enrolled in courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>, in anticipation of attempting to gain an appointment to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>. Groves earned a nomination from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Wilson</a>, which allowed him to compete for a vacancy, but did not score high enough mark on the examination to be admitted. <a href="Charles%20W.%20Bell">Charles W. Bell</a> from <a href="California%27s%209th%20congressional%20district">California's 9th congressional district</a> nominated Groves as an alternate, but the principal nominee accepted. Instead, Groves enrolled at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) and planned to re-take the West Point entrance exam. In 1916, Groves tested again, attained a passing score, and was accepted. He later said "Entering West Point fulfilled my greatest ambition. I had been brought up in the Army, and in the main had lived on Army posts all my life."

Groves' class entered West Point on 15 June 1916, but the <a href="United%20States%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany%20%281917%29">United States declaration of war on Germany</a> in April 1917 led to their program of instruction being shortened as the War Emergency Course (WEC), which graduated on 1 November 1918, a year and a half ahead of schedule. Groves finished fourth in his class, which earned him a commission as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a>, the first choice of most high ranking cadets.

At MIT he had played tennis informally but at West Point he could not skate for ice hockey, did not like basketball, and was not good enough for baseball or track. So football was his only sport. He said that "I was the number two centre but was on the bench most of the time as in those days you didn’t have substitutes and normally the number one played the whole game. I was not very heavy, and today would be considered too light to play at all".

After the traditional month's leave following graduation from West Point, Groves reported to <a href="Camp%20A.%20A.%20Humphreys">Camp A. A. Humphreys</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, in December 1918, where he was promoted to <a href="First%20lieutenant%23United%20States">first lieutenant</a> on 1 May 1919. He was sent to France in June on an educational tour of the European battlefields of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. After returning from Europe, Groves became a student officer at the Engineer School at Camp Humphreys in September 1919. On graduation he was posted to the 7th Engineers at <a href="Fort%20Benning">Fort Benning</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, as a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> commander. He returned to Camp Humphreys in February 1921 for the Engineer Basic Officers' Course. On graduation in August 1921, he was posted to the 4th Engineers, stationed at <a href="Fort%20Lewis">Camp Lewis</a>, Washington. He was then posted to <a href="Fort%20Worden">Fort Worden</a> in command of a survey detachment. This was close to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, so he was able to pursue his courtship of Grace Wilson (1897–1986), who had become a <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a> teacher. They were married in St. Clement's Episcopal Church in Seattle on 10 February 1922. Their marriage produced two children: a son, Richard Hulbert, born in 1923, and a daughter, Gwen, born in 1928.

In November 1922, Groves received his first overseas posting, as a company commander with the 3rd Engineers at the <a href="Schofield%20Barracks">Schofield Barracks</a> in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. He earned a commendation for his work there, constructing a trail from <a href="Kahuku">Kahuku</a> to <a href="Pupukea">Pupukea</a>. In November 1925 he was posted to <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston, Texas</a>, as an assistant to the District Engineer, <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Julian%20Schley">Julian Schley</a>. Groves' duties included opening the channel at <a href="Port%20Isabel%2C%20Texas">Port Isabel</a> and supervising dredging operations in <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a>. In 1927 he became commander of Company D, <a href="1st%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">1st Engineers</a>, at <a href="Fort%20DuPont">Fort DuPont</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. During the he was sent to <a href="Fort%20Ethan%20Allen">Fort Ethan Allen</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, to assist with a detachment of the 1st Engineers. After a <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a> they constructed was swamped and swept away by the flood waters, Groves was accused of negligence. A month later Groves and several of his men were seriously injured, one fatally, when a block of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a> prematurely detonated. Groves' superior wrote a critical report on him, but the <a href="Chief%20of%20Engineers">Chief of Engineers</a>, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Edgar%20Jadwin">Edgar Jadwin</a>, interceded, attributing blame to Groves' superiors instead. Groves was returned to Fort DuPont.

In 1929, Groves departed for <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> in charge of a company of the 1st Engineers as part of an expedition whose purpose was to conduct a survey for the <a href="Inter-Oceanic%20Nicaragua%20Canal">Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal</a>. Following the <a href="1931%20Nicaragua%20earthquake">1931 Nicaragua earthquake</a>, Groves took over responsibility for <a href="Managua">Managua</a>'s water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. Groves was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28US%20Army%29">captain</a> on 20 October 1934. He attended the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20School">Command and General Staff School</a> at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, in 1935 and 1936, after which he was posted to <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, as assistant to the commander of the <a href="Mississippi%20Valley%20Division">Missouri River Division</a>. In 1938 and 1939 he attended the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20War%20College">Army War College</a>. On 1 July 1939, he was posted to the War Department <a href="General%20Staff">General Staff</a> in Washington, D.C.

Groves was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> on 1 July 1940. Three weeks later, he became special assistant for construction to the <a href="Quartermaster%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Quartermaster General</a>, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Edmund%20B.%20Gregory">Edmund B. Gregory</a>. The two men had known each other a long time, as Groves' father was a close friend of Gregory's. At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the <a href="Quartermaster%20Corps">Quartermaster Corps</a> to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. Groves, who "had a reputation as a doer, a driver, and a stickler for duty", was one of a number of engineer officers brought in to turn the project around. He was tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress.

On 12 November 1940, Gregory asked Groves to take over command of the <a href="cost-plus%20contract">Fixed Fee</a> Branch of the Construction Division as soon as his promotion to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> came through. Groves assumed his new rank and duties on 14 November 1940. Groves later recalled:
Groves instituted a series of reforms. He installed phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, the worst of the crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.

On 19 August 1941, Groves was summoned to a meeting with the head of the Construction Division, <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Brehon%20B.%20Somervell">Brehon B. Somervell</a>. In attendance were Captain Clarence Renshaw, one of Groves' assistants; Major <a href="Hugh%20J.%20Casey">Hugh J. Casey</a>, the chief of the Construction Division's Design and Engineering Section; and <a href="George%20Bergstrom">George Bergstrom</a>, a former president of the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a>. Casey and Bergstrom had designed an enormous office complex to house the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department's</a> 40,000 staff together in one building, a five-story, five-sided structure, which would ultimately become <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. The Pentagon had a total square footage of —twice that of the <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a>—making it the largest office building in the world. The estimated cost was $35 million ($ with inflation), and Somervell wanted of floor space available by 1 March 1942. Bergstrom became the <a href="Architectural%20engineering">architect-engineer</a> with Renshaw in charge of construction, reporting directly to Groves. At its peak the project employed 13,000 persons. By the end of April, the first occupants were moving in and of space was ready by the end of May. In the end, the project cost some $63 million ($ with inflation).

Groves steadily overcame one crisis after another, dealing with strikes, shortages, competing priorities and engineers who were not up to their tasks. He worked six days a week in his office in Washington, D.C. During the week he would determine which project was in the greatest need of personal attention and pay it a visit on Sunday. Groves later recalled that he was "hoping to get to a war theater so I could find a little peace."

The <a href="Manhattan%20Engineer%20District">Manhattan Engineer District</a> (MED) was formally established by the Chief of Engineers, Major General <a href="Eugene%20Reybold">Eugene Reybold</a> on 16 August 1942. The name was chosen by Groves and MED's district engineer, Colonel <a href="James%20C.%20Marshall">James C. Marshall</a>. Like other engineer districts, it was named after the city where its headquarters was located, at <a href="Tower%20270">270 Broadway</a>. Unlike the others, however, it had no geographic boundaries, only a mission: to develop an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. Moreover, Marshall had the authority of a division engineer head and reported directly to Reybold. Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Dr. <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> was less so. He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested the appointment of a prestigious officer as overall project director. Somervell, now Chief of <a href="Army%20Service%20Forces">Army Service Forces</a>, recommended Groves. Somervell met Groves outside the hearing room where Groves had been testifying before a <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> committee on military housing and informed him that "<a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">The Secretary of War</a> has selected you for a very important assignment, and the <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President</a> has approved the selection ... If you do the job right, it will win the war." Groves could not hide his disappointment at not receiving a combat assignment: "Oh, that thing," he replied.
Groves met with Major General <a href="Wilhelm%20D.%20Styer">Wilhelm D. Styer</a> in his office at the Pentagon to discuss the details. They agreed that in order to avoid suspicion, Groves would continue to supervise the Pentagon project. He would be promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>, as it was felt that the title "general" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project. Groves therefore waited until his promotion came through on 23 September 1942 before assuming his new command. His orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Marshall now answerable to Groves. Groves was given authority to sign contracts for the project from September 1, 1942.
Under Secretary of War <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> (retrospectively) delegated his authority from the President under the <a href="War%20Powers%20Act%20of%201941">War Powers Act of 1941</a> in a memorandum to Groves dated April 17, 1944. Groves delegated the authority to <a href="Ken%20Nichols">Nichols</a>, except that contracts of $5 million or more required his authority. The written authority was only given in 1944 when Nichols was about to sign a contract with Du Pont, and it was found that Nichols original authority to sign project contracts from Colonel Marshall was based on a verbal authority from Styer, and Nichols only had the low delegated authority of a divisional engineer.

Groves soon decided to establish his project headquarters on the fifth floor of the <a href="Harry%20S%20Truman%20Building">New War Department Building</a> (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and <a href="Ken%20Nichols">Nichols</a>, who was in charge of the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, but the name of the district did not change.

Construction accounted for roughly 90 percent of the Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to <a href="Eminent%20domain">condemn</a> the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November <a href="US%20Marshal">US Marshal</a>s were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.

Meanwhile, Groves had met with <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> physicist, and discussed the creation of a laboratory where the bomb could be designed and tested. Groves was impressed with the breadth of Oppenheimer's knowledge. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and his deputy <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a> that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area. These were features that Groves found lacking in other scientists, and he knew that broad knowledge would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just <a href="physics">physics</a>, but <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, <a href="explosive%20weapon">ordnance</a>, and <a href="engineering">engineering</a>.
In October 1942 Groves and Oppenheimer inspected sites in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, where they selected a suitable location for the laboratory at <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos</a>. Unlike Oak Ridge, the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Ranch%20School">ranch school</a> at Los Alamos, along with of surrounding forest and grazing land, was soon acquired. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an "overweening ambition" which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion. Groves became convinced that Oppenheimer was the best and only man to run the laboratory.

Few agreed with him in 1942. Oppenheimer had little administrative experience and, unlike other potential candidates, no <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>. There was also concern about whether Oppenheimer was a security risk, as many of his associates were <a href="communist">communist</a>s, including his brother <a href="Frank%20Oppenheimer">Frank Oppenheimer</a>, his wife Kitty, and his girlfriend <a href="Jean%20Tatlock">Jean Tatlock</a>. Oppenheimer's <a href="Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a> connections soon came to light, but Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943. Groves' faith in Oppenheimer was ultimately justified. Oppenheimer's inspirational leadership fostered practical approaches to designing and building bombs. Asked years later why Groves chose him, Oppenheimer replied that the general "had a fatal weakness for good men." <a href="Isidor%20Rabi">Isidor Rabi</a> considered the appointment "a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius ..."
Groves made critical decisions on prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials needed by the scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, it was evident that the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel <a href="Lucius%20D.%20Clay">Lucius D. Clay</a>, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to <a href="Donald%20M.%20Nelson">Donald M. Nelson</a>, the chairman of the <a href="War%20Production%20Board">War Production Board</a> and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.

The Combined Development Trust was established by the governments of the United Kingdom, United States and Canada in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a> ores on international markets. In 1944, the trust purchased of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>. In order to avoid briefing <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau Jr.</a> on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5 million into the Trust's account.
In 1943, the Manhattan District became responsible for collecting <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a> on Axis atomic research. Groves created <a href="Operation%20Alsos">Operation Alsos</a>, special intelligence teams that would follow in the wake of the advancing armies, rounding up enemy scientists and collecting what technical information and technology they could. Alsos teams ultimately operated in Italy, France and Germany. The security system resembled that of other engineer districts. The Manhattan District organized its own counterintelligence which gradually grew in size and scope, but strict security measures failed to prevent the Soviets from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.

Groves met with <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Hap Arnold</a>, the Chief of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">U.S. Army Air Forces</a>, in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets. Groves was hoping that the <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> would be able to carry the finished bombs. The <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> was duly activated on 17 December 1944 at <a href="Wendover%20Army%20Air%20Field">Wendover Army Air Field</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, under the command of Colonel <a href="Paul%20W.%20Tibbets">Paul W. Tibbets</a>. A joint Manhattan District – USAAF targeting committee was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets; it recommended <a href="Kokura">Kokura</a>, <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, <a href="Niigata%20%28city%29">Niigata</a>, and <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>. At this point, <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a> intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto. Groves attempted to get him to change his mind several times and Stimson refused every time. Kyoto had been the <a href="capital%20of%20Japan">capital of Japan</a> for centuries, and was of great cultural and religious significance. In the end, Groves asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> was substituted for Kyoto as a target.
Groves was promoted to temporary <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a> on 9 March 1944. After the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> became public knowledge, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a>. His citation read:
Groves had previously been nominated for the Distinguished Service Medal for his work on the Pentagon, but to avoid drawing attention to the Manhattan Project, it had not been awarded at the time. After the war, the Decorations Board decided to change it to a <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>. In recognition of his work on the project, the Belgian government made him a Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Order of the Crown</a> and the British government made him an honorary <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>.

Responsibility for <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> and <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> was transferred from the Manhattan District to the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> and <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="James%20V.%20Forrestal">James V. Forrestal</a> issued a joint directive creating the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a> (AFSWP) to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating <a href="Sandia%20Base">Sandia Base</a> in 1946.

The <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Army Chief of Staff</a>, <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, met with Groves on 30 January 1948 to evaluate his performance. Eisenhower recounted a long list of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers%20Chiefs%20of%20Engineers">Chief of Engineers</a>. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment similar in importance to the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a> on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity nuclear test</a>.

Groves went on to become a vice president at <a href="Sperry%20Rand">Sperry Rand</a>, an equipment and electronics firm, and moved to <a href="Darien%2C%20Connecticut">Darien, Connecticut</a>, in 1948, and retired at age 65 in 1961. He also served as president of the <a href="West%20Point">West Point</a> alumni organization, the "Association of Graduates". He presented <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> the <a href="Sylvanus%20Thayer%20Award">Sylvanus Thayer Award</a> in 1962, which was the occasion of MacArthur's famous speech to the U.S. Military Academy Corps of Cadets. In retirement, Groves wrote an account of the Manhattan Project entitled "Now It Can Be Told", originally published in 1962. In 1964, he moved back to Washington, D.C.

Groves suffered a <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> caused by chronic <a href="calcification">calcification</a> of the <a href="aortic%20valve">aortic valve</a> on 13 July 1970. He was rushed to <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center">Walter Reed Army Medical Center</a> in Washington, where he died at age 73 that night. A funeral service was held in the chapel at <a href="Fort%20Myer%2C%20Virginia">Fort Myer, Virginia</a>, after which Groves was interred in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> next to his brother Allen, who had died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 1916.

Groves is memorialized at a namesake park along the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, near the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> in <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland, Washington</a>.

Emily Davison

Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872 – 8 June 1913) was a <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> who fought for <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">votes for women</a> in Britain in the early twentieth century. A member of the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on ten occasions, went on <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a> seven times and was <a href="force%20fed">force fed</a> on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by <a href="George%20V">King George V</a>'s horse Anmer at the <a href="1913%20Epsom%20Derby">1913 Derby</a> when she walked onto the track during the race, some people believed she was trying to pin a badge about women's rights onto the horse but failed.

Davison grew up in a middle-class family, and studied at <a href="Royal%20Holloway%2C%20University%20of%20London">Royal Holloway College</a>, London, and <a href="St%20Hugh%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St Hugh's College, Oxford</a>, before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>—including on the night of the 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in <a href="Morpeth%2C%20Northumberland">Morpeth, Northumberland</a>.

Davison was a <a href="Christian%20feminism">staunch feminist and passionate Christian</a>, and considered that <a href="socialism">socialism</a> was a moral and political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse.

Emily Wilding Davison was born at Roxburgh House, Greenwich, in south-east London on 11 October 1872. Her parents were Charles Davison, a retired merchant, and Margaret, "" Caisley, both of <a href="Morpeth%2C%20Northumberland">Morpeth, Northumberland</a>. At the time of his marriage to Margaret in 1868, Charles was 45 and Margaret was 19. Emily was the third of four children born to the couple; her younger sister died of <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> in 1880 at the age of six. The marriage to Margaret was Charles's second; his first marriage produced nine children before the death of his wife in 1866.

The family moved to <a href="Sawbridgeworth">Sawbridgeworth</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, while Davison was still a baby; until the age of 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year studying in <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, France. When she was 13 she attended <a href="Kensington%20Preparatory%20School">Kensington High School</a> and later won a <a href="bursary">bursary</a> to <a href="Royal%20Holloway%2C%20University%20of%20London">Royal Holloway College</a> in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of £20 a term.

On leaving Holloway, Davison became a live-in <a href="governess">governess</a>, and continued studying in the evenings. She saved enough money to enrol at <a href="St%20Hugh%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St Hugh's College, Oxford</a>, for one term to sit her <a href="Final%20examination">finals</a>; she achieved <a href="first-class%20honours">first-class honours</a> in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women. She worked briefly at a <a href="church%20school">church school</a> in <a href="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a> between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a <a href="private%20school">private school</a> in <a href="Worthing">Worthing</a>, where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>. In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>; she graduated with <a href="third-class%20honours">third-class honours</a> in 1908.

Davison joined the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU) in November 1906. Formed in 1903 by <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, the WSPU brought together those who thought that militant, confrontational tactics were needed to achieve their ultimate goal of women's suffrage. Davison joined in the WSPU's campaigning, and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. In 1908 or 1909 she left her job teaching and dedicated herself full-time to the union. She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted <a href="Sylvia%20Pankhurst">Sylvia Pankhurst</a>—the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPU—to describe her as "one of the most daring and reckless of the militants". In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from <a href="Caxton%20Hall">Caxton Hall</a> to see the prime minister, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, the march ended in a fracas with police, and she was arrested for "assaulting the police in the execution of their duty". She was sentenced to a month in prison. After her release she wrote to "Votes for Women", the WSPU's newspaper, saying that "Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced."
In July 1909 Davison was arrested with fellow suffragettes <a href="Mary%20Leigh">Mary Leigh</a> and <a href="Alice%20Paul">Alice Paul</a> for interrupting a public meeting from which women were barred, held by the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on <a href="Hunger%20strike%23British%20and%20American%20suffragettes">hunger strike</a> and was released after five and a half days, during which time she lost ; she stated that she "felt very weak" as a result. She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the <a href="People%27s%20Budget">1909 budget</a>, was only open to men. She was sent to <a href="Strangeways%20prison">Strangeways prison</a> for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days. She subsequently wrote to "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" to justify her action of throwing stones as one "which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere". She went on to write that this was justified because of the "unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded".

Davison was arrested again in early October 1909, while preparing to throw a stone at the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cabinet minister</a> <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Sir Walter Runciman</a>; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague—<a href="Lady%20Constance%20Bulwer-Lytton">Constance Lytton</a>—threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month. Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these were published in the newspapers. Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in <a href="Radcliffe%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Radcliffe, Greater Manchester</a>; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's <a href="hard%20labour">hard labour</a>. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of <a href="Force-feeding%23United%20Kingdom">force-feeding</a> on prisoners. The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as "extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment". Davison said that the experience "will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable. ... The torture was barbaric". Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days. Davison's treatment prompted the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> MP <a href="Keir%20Hardie">Keir Hardie</a> to ask a question in the House of Commons about the "assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways"; Davison sued the prison authorities for the use of the hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> in damages.

In April 1910 Davison decided to gain entry to the floor of the House of Commons to ask Asquith about the vote for women. She entered the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> with other members of the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted. The same month she became an employee of the WSPU and began to write for "Votes for Women".

A bipartisan group of MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a <a href="Conciliation%20Bill">Conciliation Bill</a> that would have brought the vote to a million women, so long as they owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day <a href="Black%20Friday%20%281910%29">Black Friday</a>, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20Crown%20in%20Chancery">Crown Office</a> in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.

On the night of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a cupboard in <a href="St%20Mary%20Undercroft">St Mary Undercroft</a>, the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings. Davison had continually written letters to the press to put forward the WSPU position in a non-violent manner—she had 12 published in "The Manchester Guardian" between 1909 and 1911—and she undertook a campaign between 1911 and 1913 during which she wrote nearly 200 letters to over 50 newspapers. Several of her letters were published, including about 26 in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" between September 1910 and 1912.
Davison developed the new tactic of setting fire to postboxes in December 1911. She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in <a href="Holloway%20Prison">Holloway Prison</a>, she did not go on hunger strike at first, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers. Following the force-feeding, Davison decided on what she described as a "desperate protest ... made to put a stop to the hideous torture, which was now our lot" and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison. She later wrote:

... as soon as I got out I climbed on to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a distance of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught on the edge of the netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.

She cracked two <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> and badly injured her head. Shortly afterwards, and despite her injuries, she was again force-fed before being released ten days early. She wrote to "<a href="The%20Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">The Pall Mall Gazette</a>" to explain why she "attempted to commit suicide":

I did it deliberately and with all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.

As a result of her action Davison suffered discomfort for the rest of her life. Her arson of postboxes was not authorised by the WSPU leadership and this, together with her other actions, led to her falling out of favour with the organisation; Sylvia Pankhurst later wrote that the WSPU leadership wanted "to discourage ... [Davison] in such tendencies ... She was condemned and ostracized as a self-willed person who persisted in acting upon her own initiative without waiting for official instructions." A statement Davison wrote on her release from prison for "The Suffragette"—the second official newspaper of the WSPU—was published by the union after her death.

In November 1912 Davison was arrested for a final time, for attacking a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> minister with a horsewhip; she had mistaken the man for Lloyd George. She was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment and released early following a four-day hunger strike. It was the seventh time she had been on hunger strike, and the forty-ninth time she had been force-fed.

On 4 June 1913 Davison obtained two flags bearing the <a href="Suffragette%23Colours">suffragette colours</a> of purple, white and green from the WSPU offices; she then travelled by train to <a href="Epsom">Epsom</a>, Surrey, to attend the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby</a>. She positioned herself at Tattenham Corner, the final bend before the <a href="home%20straight">home straight</a>. At this point in the race, with some of the horses having passed her, she ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the course; she may have held in her hands one of the suffragette flags. She reached up to the reins of Anmer—<a href="George%20V">King George V</a>'s horse, ridden by <a href="Herbert%20Jones%20%28jockey%29">Herbert Jones</a>—and was hit by the animal, which would have been travelling at around per hour, four seconds after stepping onto the course. Anmer fell in the collision and partly rolled over his jockey, who had his foot momentarily caught in the stirrup. Davison was knocked to the ground unconscious; some reports say she was kicked in the head by Anmer, but the surgeon who operated on Davison stated that "I could find no trace of her having been kicked by a horse". The event was captured on three news cameras.
Bystanders rushed onto the track and attempted to aid Davison and Jones until both were taken to the nearby <a href="Epsom%20Cottage%20Hospital">Epsom Cottage Hospital</a>. She was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail. She died on 8 June, from a <a href="basilar%20skull%20fracture">fracture at the base of her skull</a>. Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> were present at the race and made enquiries about the health of both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of 4 June in London, before returning home the following day. He could recall little of the event: "She seemed to clutch at my horse, and I felt it strike her." He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> two weeks later.

The inquest into Davison's death took place at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend. Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave evidence about his sister, saying that she was "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement". The coroner decided that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide. The coroner also decided that, although she had waited until she could see the horses, "from the evidence it was clear that the woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular". The verdict of the court was:

that Miss Emily Wilding Davison died of fracture of the base of the skull, caused by being accidentally knocked down by a horse through wilfully rushing on to the racecourse on Epsom Downs during the progress of the race for the Derby; death was due to misadventure.
Davison's purpose in attending the Derby and walking onto the course is unclear. She did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note. Several theories have been suggested, including that she intended to cross the track, believing that all horses had passed; that she wanted to pull down the King's horse; that she was trying to attach one of the WSPU flags to a horse; or that she intended to throw herself in front of one of the horses. The historian Elizabeth Crawford considers that "subsequent explanations of ... [Davison's] action have created a tangle of fictions, false deductions, hearsay, conjecture, misrepresentation and theory".

In 2013 a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary used forensic examiners who digitised the original <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a> from the three cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag around the neck of a horse or attach it to the horse's <a href="bridle">bridle</a>. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>, the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was "reputed" to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course on the day of the Derby was Henry Mayson Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of her jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69 cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30 cm).

Tanner considers that Davison's choice of the King's horse was "pure happenstance", as her position on the corner would have left her with a limited view. Examination of the newsreels by the forensic team employed by the Channel 4 documentary determined that Davison was closer to the start of the bend than had been previously assumed, and would have had a better view of the oncoming horses.

The contemporary news media were largely unsympathetic to Davison, and many publications "questioned her sanity and characterised her actions as suicidal". "The Pall Mall Gazette" said it had "pity for the dementia which led an unfortunate woman to seek a grotesque and meaningless kind of 'martyrdom' ", while "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" described Davison as "A well-known malignant suffragette,  ... [who] has a long record of convictions for complicity in suffragette outrages." The journalist for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" observed that "Deep in the hearts of every onlooker was a feeling of fierce resentment with the miserable woman"; the unnamed writer in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a>" opined that "It was quite evident that her condition was serious; otherwise many of the crowd would have fulfilled their evident desire to lynch her."

The WSPU were quick to describe her as a martyr, part of a campaign to identify her as such. "The Suffragette" newspaper marked Davison's death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms standing in front of the guard rail of a racecourse. The paper's editorial stated that "Davison has proved that there are in the twentieth century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal". Religious phraseology was used in the issue to describe her act, including "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends", which Gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of the events. A year after the Derby, "The Suffragette" included "The Price of Liberty", an essay by Davison. In it, she had written "To lay down life for friends, that is glorious, selfless, inspiring! But to re-enact the tragedy of Calvary for generations yet unborn, that is the last consummate sacrifice of the Militant".

On 14 June 1913 Davison's body was transported from Epsom to London; her coffin was inscribed "Fight on. God will give the victory." Five thousand women formed a procession, followed by hundreds of male supporters, that took the body between <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">Victoria</a> and <a href="Kings%20Cross%2C%20London">Kings Cross</a> stations; the procession stopped at <a href="St%20George%27s%2C%20Bloomsbury">St George's, Bloomsbury</a> for a brief service. The women marched in ranks wearing the suffragette colours of white and purple, which "The Manchester Guardian" described as having "something of the deliberate brilliance of a military funeral"; 50,000 people lined the route, and <a href="June%20Purvis">June Purvis</a>, Davison's biographer, describes the event as "the last of the great suffragette spectacles". Emmeline Pankhurst planned to be part of the procession, but she was arrested on the morning, ostensibly to be returned to prison under the <a href="Prisoners%20%28Temporary%20Discharge%20for%20Ill%20Health%29%20Act%201913">"Cat and Mouse" Act (1913)</a>.

The coffin was taken by train to <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> with a suffragette guard of honour for the journey; crowds met the train at its scheduled stops. The coffin remained overnight at the city's <a href="Newcastle%20railway%20station">central station</a> before being taken to Morpeth. A procession of about a hundred suffragettes accompanied the coffin from the station to the <a href="St%20Mary%27s%2C%20Highchurch">St. Mary the Virgin</a> church; it was watched by thousands. Only a few of the suffragettes entered the churchyard, as the service and interment were private. Her gravestone bears the WSPU slogan "Deeds not words".

Davison's death marked a culmination and a turning point of the militant suffragette campaign. The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out the following year and, on 10 August 1914, the government released all women hunger strikers and declared an amnesty. Emmeline Pankhurst suspended WSPU operations on 13 August. Pankhurst subsequently assisted the government in the recruitment of women for war work. In 1918 Parliament passed the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201918">Representation of the People Act 1918</a>. Among the changes was the granting of the vote to women over the age of 30 who could pass property qualifications. The legislation added 8.5 million women to the electoral roll; they constituted 43% of the electorate. In 1928 the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20%28Equal%20Franchise%29%20Act%201928">Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act</a> lowered the voting age for women to 21 to put them on equal terms with male voters.

Crawford sees the events at the 1913 Derby as a lens "through which ... [Davison's] whole life has been interpreted", and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. <a href="Carolyn%20Collette">Carolyn Collette</a>, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including "uncontrolled impulses" or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. <a href="Cicely%20Hale">Cicely Hale</a>, a suffragette who worked at the WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as "a fanatic" who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.

Davison was a <a href="Christian%20feminism">staunch feminist and a passionate Christian</a> whose outlook "invoked both medieval history and faith in God as part of the armour of her militancy". Her love of English literature, which she had studied at Oxford, was shown in her identification with <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Knight%27s%20Tale">The Knight's Tale</a>", including being nicknamed "Faire Emelye". Much of Davison's writing reflected the doctrine of the Christian faith and referred to martyrs, martyrdom and triumphant suffering; according to Collette, the use of Christian and medieval language and imagery "directly reflects the politics and rhetoric of the militant suffrage movement". Purvis writes that Davison's committed Anglicanism would have stopped her from committing suicide because it would have meant that she could not be buried in <a href="consecrated%20ground">consecrated ground</a>. Davison wrote in "The Price of Liberty" about the high cost of devotion to the cause:

In the New Testament, the Master reminded His followers that when the merchant had found the Pearl of Great Price, he sold all that he had in order to buy it. That is the parable of Militancy! It is that which the women warriors are doing to-day.<br>
Some are truer warriors than others, but the perfect Amazon is she who will sacrifice all even unto the last, to win the Pearl of Freedom for her sex.

Davison held a firm moral conviction that <a href="socialism">socialism</a> was a moral and political force for good. She attended the annual <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> rallies in Hyde Park and, according to the historian Krista Cowman, "directly linked her militant suffrage activities with socialism". Her London and Morpeth funeral processions contained a heavy socialist presence in appreciation of her support for the cause.

In 1968 a one-act play written by Joice Worters, "Emily", was staged in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, focusing on the use of violence against the women's campaign. Davison is the subject of an opera, "Emily" (2013), by the British composer <a href="Tim%20Benjamin">Tim Benjamin</a>, and of "Emily Davison", a song by the American rock singer <a href="Greg%20Kihn">Greg Kihn</a>. Davison also appears as a supporting character in the 2015 film "<a href="Suffragette%20%28film%29">Suffragette</a>", in which she is portrayed by <a href="Natalie%20Press">Natalie Press</a>. Her death and funeral form the climax of the film. In January 2018 the <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "Pearl of Freedom", telling the story of Davison's suffragette struggles, was premiered. The music was by the composer Joanna Marsh; the <a href="librettist">librettist</a> was <a href="David%20Pountney">David Pountney</a>.

In 1990 the Labour MPs <a href="Tony%20Benn">Tony Benn</a> and <a href="Jeremy%20Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> placed a commemorative plaque inside the cupboard in which Davison had hidden eighty years earlier. In April 2013 a plaque was unveiled at <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20Racecourse">Epsom racecourse</a> to mark the centenary of her death. In January 2017 <a href="Royal%20Holloway%2C%20University%20of%20London">Royal Holloway, University of London</a> announced that its new library would be named after her. The <a href="statue%20of%20Millicent%20Fawcett">statue of Millicent Fawcett</a> in <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a>, London, unveiled in April 2018, features Davison's name and picture, along with those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, on the <a href="plinth">plinth</a> of the statue. The <a href="Women%27s%20Library">Women's Library</a>, at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, holds several collections related to Davison. They include her personal papers and objects connected to her death.

Cleopatra

Cleopatra VII Philopator (; 69 – 10 or 12 August 30 BC) was the last active ruler of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, nominally survived as <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> by her son <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>. She was also a diplomat, <a href="Ancient%20navies%20and%20vessels">naval commander</a>, linguist, and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20medicine">medical author</a>. As a member of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>, she was a descendant of its founder <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a>, a <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian</a> <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> general and <a href="Government%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29%23Companions%2C%20friends%2C%20councils%2C%20and%20assemblies">companion</a> of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. After the <a href="death%20of%20Cleopatra">death of Cleopatra</a>, Egypt became <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">a province</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, marking the end of the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> that had lasted since the <a href="Death%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">reign of Alexander</a> (336–323 BC). Her native language was <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>.

In 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII</a> during his exile to Rome, after a revolt in Egypt allowed his eldest daughter <a href="Berenice%20IV">Berenice IV</a> to claim the throne. The latter was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy XII returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When Ptolemy XII died in 51 BC, <a href="Reign%20of%20Cleopatra">he was succeeded</a> by Cleopatra and her younger brother <a href="Ptolemy%20XIII">Ptolemy XIII</a> as joint rulers, but a falling-out between them led to open civil war. After losing the 48 BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Pharsalus">Battle of Pharsalus</a> in <a href="Roman%20Greece">Greece</a> against his rival <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in <a href="Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War">Caesar's Civil War</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> statesman <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> fled to Egypt, a <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20client%20kings">Roman client state</a>. Ptolemy XIII had Pompey killed while Caesar occupied <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in pursuit of Pompey. As <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, Caesar attempted to reconcile Ptolemy XIII with Cleopatra. However, Ptolemy XIII's chief adviser, <a href="Potheinos">Potheinos</a>, viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, and so <a href="Ptolemaic%20army">his forces</a>, which eventually fell under the control of Cleopatra's younger sister, <a href="Arsinoe%20IV">Arsinoe IV</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Alexandria%20%2847%20BC%29">besieged both Caesar and Cleopatra at the palace</a>. The siege was lifted by reinforcements in early 47 BC. Ptolemy XIII died shortly thereafter in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile%20%2847%20BC%29">Battle of the Nile</a>, Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, and Caesar, now an <a href="Roman%20dictator">elected dictator</a>, declared Cleopatra and her other younger brother <a href="Ptolemy%20XIV">Ptolemy XIV</a> as joint rulers of Egypt. However, Caesar maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son, Caesarion (<a href="Ptolemy%20XV">Ptolemy XV</a>). Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20client%20queens">client queen</a> in 46 and 44 BC, staying at <a href="Horti%20Caesaris">Caesar's villa</a>. When <a href="Assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">Caesar was assassinated</a> in 44 BC, Cleopatra attempted to have Caesarion named as his heir, but this fell instead to Caesar's grandnephew <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a> (known as <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> by 27 BC, when he became the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>). Cleopatra then had Ptolemy XIV killed and elevated Caesarion as co-ruler.

In the <a href="Liberators%27%20civil%20war">Liberators' civil war</a> of 43–42 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a> formed by Octavian, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a>. After their meeting at <a href="Tarsos">Tarsos</a> in 41 BC, Cleopatra had an affair with Antony that would eventually produce three children: <a href="Alexander%20Helios">Alexander Helios</a>, <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20II">Cleopatra Selene II</a>, and <a href="Ptolemy%20Philadelphus%20%28son%20of%20Cleopatra%29">Ptolemy Philadelphus</a>. Antony used his authority as a <a href="triumvir">triumvir</a> to carry out the execution of Arsinoe IV at Cleopatra's request. He became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during <a href="Antony%27s%20Parthian%20War">his invasions</a> of the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Kingdom of Armenia</a>. In the <a href="Donations%20of%20Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria</a>, Cleopatra's children with Antony were declared rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's authority. This event, along with his marriage to Cleopatra and divorce of Octavian's sister <a href="Octavia%20Minor">Octavia Minor</a>, led to the <a href="Final%20War%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">Final War of the Roman Republic</a>. After engaging in a war of propaganda, Octavian forced Antony's allies in the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> to flee Rome in 32 BC and declared war on Cleopatra. The naval fleet of Antony and Cleopatra was defeated at the 31 BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> by Octavian's general <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a>. <a href="Roman%20army%20of%20the%20late%20Republic">Octavian's forces</a> invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated those of Antony, leading to his suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to Rome for his <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumphal procession</a>, she committed suicide by poisoning, with the popular belief being that she was bitten by an <a href="Asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a>.

Cleopatra's legacy survives in <a href="List%20of%20cultural%20depictions%20of%20Cleopatra">numerous works of art</a>, both ancient and modern, and many dramatizations of incidents from her life in literature and other media. She was described in various works of <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historiography</a> and <a href="Latin%20poetry">Latin poetry</a>, the latter producing a generally polemic and negative view of the queen that pervaded later <a href="Medieval%20literature">Medieval</a> and <a href="Renaissance%20literature">Renaissance literature</a>. In the visual arts, ancient depictions of Cleopatra include <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman</a> and <a href="Ptolemaic%20coinage">Ptolemaic coinage</a>, <a href="Roman%20sculpture">statues</a>, <a href="Roman%20portraiture">busts</a>, <a href="relief">relief</a>s, <a href="cameo%20glass">cameo glass</a>, <a href="Cameo%20%28carving%29">cameo carvings</a>, and <a href="Roman%20art">paintings</a>. She was the subject of many works in <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Baroque%20art">Baroque art</a>, which included sculptures, paintings, poetry, theatrical dramas such as <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" (1608), and <a href="opera">opera</a>s such as <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s "<a href="Giulio%20Cesare%20in%20Egitto">Giulio Cesare in Egitto</a>" (1724). In modern times Cleopatra has appeared in both the applied and fine arts, <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> satire, Hollywood films such as "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1963), and <a href="brand%20image">brand image</a>s for commercial products, becoming a <a href="pop%20culture%20icon">pop culture icon</a> of <a href="Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> since the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>.

The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> (), meaning "glory of her father", from (, "glory") and (, "father"). The masculine form would have been written either as () or (). Cleopatra was <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20personal%20names">the name</a> of <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedon">Alexander the Great's sister</a>, as well as <a href="Cleopatra%20Alcyone">Cleopatra Alcyone</a>, wife of <a href="Meleager">Meleager</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>. Through the marriage of <a href="Ptolemy%20V%20Epiphanes">Ptolemy V Epiphanes</a> and <a href="Cleopatra%20I%20Syra">Cleopatra I Syra</a> (a <a href="List%20of%20Seleucid%20rulers">Seleucid princess</a>), the name entered the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>. Cleopatra's adopted title () means "goddess who loves her father."

Ptolemaic <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s were <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">crowned</a> by the Egyptian <a href="High%20Priest%20of%20Ptah">High Priest of Ptah</a> at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis, Egypt</a>, but resided in the multicultural and largely <a href="Culture%20of%20Greece">Greek</a> city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, established by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a>. They <a href="History%20of%20Greek">spoke Greek</a> and governed Egypt as <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic Greek</a> monarchs, refusing to learn the <a href="Late%20Egyptian%20language">native Egyptian language</a>. In contrast, Cleopatra could speak <a href="Multilingualism">multiple languages</a> by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>. She also spoke <a href="Meroitic%20language">Ethiopian</a>, <a href="Trogodyte">Trogodyte</a>, <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Hebrew</a> (or <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>), <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, the <a href="Languages%20of%20Syria">Syrian language</a> (perhaps <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a>), <a href="Median%20language">Median</a>, <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian</a>, and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, although her <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>. Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore <a href="History%20of%20North%20Africa">North African</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Middle%20East">West Asian</a> territories that once belonged to the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>.

Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the <a href="reign%20of%20Cleopatra">reign of Cleopatra</a>. When <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX Lathyros</a> died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter <a href="Berenice%20III">Berenice III</a>. However, with opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson <a href="Ptolemy%20XI%20Alexander%20II">Ptolemy XI Alexander II</a>, an arrangement made by the Roman dictator <a href="Sulla">Sulla</a>. Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, but was <a href="Lynching">lynched</a> soon thereafter in the resulting riot over the assassination. Ptolemy XI, and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father <a href="Ptolemy%20X%20Alexander%20I">Ptolemy X Alexander I</a>, willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as <a href="Collateral%20%28finance%29">collateral for loans</a>, so that the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt, their <a href="client%20state">client state</a>, after the assassination of Ptolemy XI. The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the <a href="Legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29">illegitimate</a> sons of Ptolemy IX, bestowing <a href="Ancient%20history%20of%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a> to <a href="Ptolemy%20of%20Cyprus">Ptolemy of Cyprus</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> to <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII Auletes</a>.

Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic pharaoh</a> Ptolemy XII and an unknown mother, presumably Ptolemy XII's wife <a href="Cleopatra%20VI%20Tryphaena">Cleopatra VI Tryphaena</a> (also known as <a href="Cleopatra%20V%20Tryphaena">Cleopatra V Tryphaena</a>), the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, <a href="Berenice%20IV%20of%20Egypt">Berenice IV Epiphaneia</a>. Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC. The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister <a href="Arsinoe%20IV">Arsinoe IV</a> and brothers <a href="Ptolemy%20XIII%20Theos%20Philopator">Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator</a> and <a href="Ptolemy%20XIV">Ptolemy XIV</a>, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the <a href="Education%20in%20ancient%20Greece">Greek arts</a> of oration and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">philosophy</a>. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the <a href="Musaeum">Musaeum</a>, including the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>.

In 65 BC the <a href="Roman%20censor">Roman censor</a> <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> argued before the <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">Roman Senate</a> that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his <a href="Bill%20%28law%29">proposed bill</a> and the similar bill of <a href="tribune">tribune</a> <a href="Servilius%20Rullus">Servilius Rullus</a> in 63 BC were rejected. Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering <a href="remuneration">remuneration</a> and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> during <a href="Third%20Mithridatic%20War">his campaign</a> against <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a>, and eventually <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> after he became <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman consul</a> in 59 BC. However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him and he was forced to acquire loans from the <a href="Roman%20banking">Roman banker</a> <a href="Gaius%20Rabirius%20Postumus">Gaius Rabirius Postumus</a>.
In 58 BC the Romans <a href="Roman%20Cyprus">annexed Cyprus</a> and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a>. Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which, along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans, damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies. Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force, traveling first to <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, then <a href="Ancient%20Athens">Athens</a>, and finally the <a href="Roman%20villa">villa</a> of <a href="First%20Triumvirate">triumvir</a> Pompey in the <a href="Alban%20Hills">Alban Hills</a>, near <a href="Praeneste">Praeneste</a>, Italy. Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year there on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra, then about 11. Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy, an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters. When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the <a href="Temple%20of%20Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> in <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>.

The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power. Pompey persuaded <a href="Aulus%20Gabinius">Aulus Gabinius</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Syria">Roman governor of Syria</a>, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000 <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talents</a> for the proposed mission. Although it put him at odds with <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a>, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of <a href="Hasmonean%20dynasty">Hasmonean Judea</a>, where <a href="Hyrcanus%20II">Hyrcanus II</a> had <a href="Antipater%20the%20Idumaean">Antipater the Idumaean</a>, father of <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herod the Great</a>, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies. As a young cavalry officer, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> was under Gabinius's command. He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of <a href="Pelousion">Pelousion</a>, and for rescuing the body of <a href="Archelaus%20%28high%20priest%20of%20Comana%20Cappadocia%29">Archelaos</a>, the husband of Berenice IV, after he was killed in battle, ensuring him a proper royal burial. Cleopatra, now 14 years of age, would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.

Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority, for which he was acquitted, but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile, from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar. Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt, but he was killed by the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a> in 53 BC. Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties. He allowed Gabinius's largely <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> and <a href="Gaul">Gallic</a> Roman garrison, the <a href="Gabiniani">Gabiniani</a>, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer. Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources. Despite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the <a href="Temple%20of%20Edfu">Temple of Edfu</a> and a temple at <a href="Dendera">Dendera</a>, and stabilized the economy. On 31 May 52 BC Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII as indicated by an inscription in the <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">Temple of Hathor</a> at Dendera. Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII's debt by the time of the latter's death, and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.

Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to <a href="Hermonthis">Hermonthis</a>, near <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, to install a new sacred <a href="Buchis">Buchis</a> bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god <a href="Montu">Montu</a> in the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Ancient Egyptian religion</a>. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual <a href="flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">flooding of the Nile</a>, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt. Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> 17.5 million <a href="drachma">drachma</a>s.

In 50 BC <a href="Marcus%20Calpurnius%20Bibulus">Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus</a>, <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt, most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria <a href="Roman-Parthian%20Wars">against the Parthians</a>. However, the Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate. Bibulus, siding with Pompey in <a href="Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War">Caesar's Civil War</a>, failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece, which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.

By 29 August 51 BC, official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler. She had probably married him, but there is no record of this. The Ptolemaic practice of <a href="sibling%20marriage">sibling marriage</a> was introduced by <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> and his sister <a href="Arsinoe%20II">Arsinoe II</a>. A <a href="Osiris%20myth">long-held royal Egyptian practice</a>, it was loathed by contemporary <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>. By the reign of Cleopatra, however, it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.

Despite Cleopatra's rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies, notably the eunuch <a href="Potheinos">Potheinos</a>, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included <a href="Achillas">Achillas</a>, a prominent military commander, and <a href="Theodotus%20of%20Chios">Theodotus of Chios</a>, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first <a href="regnal%20date">regnal date</a> in 49 BC.

In the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and <a href="Ptolemaic%20army">her forces</a> were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20%28son%20of%20Pompey%20the%20Great%29">Gnaeus Pompeius</a> arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from <a href="Gallic%20Wars">the wars in Gaul</a> and <a href="crossing%20the%20Rubicon">crossing the Rubicon</a> in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to <a href="Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War%23Civil%20War">flee to Greece</a>. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome. Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes. By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to <a href="Roman%20Syria">Roman Syria</a> with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt. She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>.

In Greece, Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Pharsalus">Battle of Pharsalus</a> on 9 August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre, Lebanon</a>. Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces. Ptolemy XIII's advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war. In a scheme devised by Theodotus, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC. Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's head, severed and <a href="embalm">embalm</a>ed, sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace. Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.

Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> records that she did so without informing her brother, dressing in an attractive manner and charming him with her wit. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> provides an entirely different and perhaps mythical account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.
When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot, but he was arrested by Caesar, who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd. Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the <a href="Boule%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">assembly of Alexandria</a>, where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII—previously possessed by Pompey—naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs. Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.

Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20,000 including the Gabiniani could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4,000 unsupported troops, Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra. After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos, Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen, but soon afterward had her tutor <a href="Ganymedes%20%28eunuch%29">Ganymedes</a> kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army. Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV. The resulting <a href="Siege%20of%20Alexandria%20%2847%20BC%29">siege of the palace</a> with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside lasted into the following year of 47 BC.

Sometime between January and March of 47 BC Caesar's reinforcements arrived, including those led by <a href="Mithridates%20I%20of%20the%20Bosporus">Mithridates of Pergamon</a> and Antipater the Idumaean. Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile%20%2847%20BC%29">where Caesar attacked them</a>. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat but it capsized and he drowned. Ganymedes was perhaps killed in the battle, Theodotus was found years later in Asia by <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus">Marcus Junius Brutus</a> and executed, while Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumph in Rome</a> before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar's child since September 47 BC.

Caesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC. However, Antony, an officer of his, helped to secure Caesar's <a href="Roman%20dictator">election as dictator</a> lasting for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt. Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra's sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler, Caesar appointed her 12-year-old brother, Ptolemy XIV, as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar. The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC.
Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">Egyptian monuments</a>, although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event. The historian <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of "<a href="Thalamegos">Thalamegos</a>", the <a href="pleasure%20barge">pleasure barge</a> constructed by <a href="Ptolemy%20IV">Ptolemy IV</a>, which during his reign measured in length and in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and <a href="Promenade%20deck">promenades</a> along its two decks, resembling a floating villa. Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> and <a href="Pytheas">Pytheas</a> and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but turned back before reaching <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>.

Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC, allegedly to confront <a href="Pharnaces%20II%20of%20Pontus">Pharnaces II of Pontus</a>, son of Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia. It is possible that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman <a href="Calpurnia%20%28wife%20of%20Caesar%29">Calpurnia</a>, also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she bore him their son. He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the <a href="freedman">freedman</a> <a href="Rufio%20%28officer%20of%20Caesar%29">Rufio</a> to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position, but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.

<a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>, Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar, was born 23 June 47 BC, and was originally named "Pharaoh Caesar", as preserved on a <a href="stele">stele</a> at the <a href="Serapeum">Serapeum</a> in Memphis. Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private). Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage, with Caesar as the father.
Cleopatra and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion, and were given lodging in Caesar's villa within the <a href="Horti%20Caesaris">Horti Caesaris</a>. As with their father Ptolemy XII, Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of "friend and ally of the Roman people" (), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome. Cleopatra's visitors at Caesar's villa across the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a> included the senator <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, who found her to be arrogant. <a href="Sosigenes%20of%20Alexandria">Sosigenes of Alexandria</a>, one of the members of Cleopatra's court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>, put into effect 1 January 45 BC. The <a href="Temple%20of%20Venus%20Genetrix">Temple of Venus Genetrix</a>, established in the <a href="Forum%20of%20Caesar">Forum of Caesar</a> on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>, mother of the Romans. The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess <a href="Isis">Isis</a> with the <a href="Roman%20religion">Roman religion</a>.

Cleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the <a href="Lupercalia">Lupercalia</a> festival a month before Caesar's assassination. Antony attempted to place a royal <a href="diadem">diadem</a> on Caesar's head, with the latter refusing in what was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship. Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen who he abhorred. <a href="Assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">Caesar was assassinated</a> on the <a href="Ides%20of%20March">Ides of March</a> (15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir. However, Caesar's will named his grandnephew <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a> as the primary heir, and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt. A few months later, Cleopatra had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning, elevating her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.

Octavian, Antony, and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a> formed the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a> in 43 BC, in which they were each <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20Roman%20Republic">elected</a> for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and <a href="Liberators%27%20civil%20war">bring Caesar's assassins to justice</a>. Cleopatra received messages from both <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Gaius Cassius Longinus</a>, one of Caesar's assassins, and <a href="Publius%20Cornelius%20Dolabella">Publius Cornelius Dolabella</a>, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. However, these troops were captured by Cassius in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. While <a href="Serapion%20%28strategos%29">Serapion</a>, Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships, Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony, but her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting. By the autumn of 42 BC, Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a> in Greece, leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.

By the end of 42 BC, Octavian had gained control over much of <a href="Greek%20East%20and%20Latin%20West">the western half</a> of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized. In the summer of 41 BC Antony established his headquarters at <a href="Tarsos">Tarsos</a> in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters, which she rebuffed until Antony's envoy <a href="Quintus%20Dellius">Quintus Dellius</a> convinced her to come. The meeting allowed Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen. Cleopatra sailed up the <a href="Berdan%20River">Kydnos River</a> to Tarsos in "Thalamegos", hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship. Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria, and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister, Arsinoe IV, executed at Ephesus. Cleopatra's former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.

Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. Antony was well-received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as <a href="Publius%20Ventidius%20Bassus">Publius Ventidius Bassus</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Gindarus">drive the Parthians out</a> of Anatolia and Syria.

Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise. With his powers as a triumvir, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands, which were currently in Roman hands, to Cleopatra. While it is clear that both <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> and Cyprus were under Cleopatra's control by 19 November 38 BC, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41–40 BC, during her time spent with Antony.

By the spring of 40 BC, Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor <a href="Lucius%20Decidius%20Saxa">Lucius Decidius Saxa</a> was killed and his army taken by <a href="Quintus%20Labienus">Quintus Labienus</a>, a former officer under Cassius who now served the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>. Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. She would not see Antony again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence, and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp. By the end of 40 BC, Cleopatra had given birth to twins, a boy named <a href="Alexander%20Helios">Alexander Helios</a> and a girl named <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20II">Cleopatra Selene II</a>, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children. <a href="Helios">Helios</a> (the Sun) and <a href="Selene">Selene</a> (the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the <a href="Wars%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">exploits of Alexander the Great</a> by conquering the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>.
Mark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the <a href="Perusine%20War">Perusine War</a> (41–40 BC), initiated by his ambitious wife <a href="Fulvia">Fulvia</a> against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra, but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos. Fulvia and Antony's brother <a href="Lucius%20Antonius%20%28brother%20of%20Mark%20Antony%29">Lucius Antonius</a> were eventually besieged by Octavian at <a href="Perusia">Perusia</a> (modern <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy) and then exiled from Italy, after which Fulvia died at <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a> in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at <a href="Brundisium">Brundisium</a> in Italy in September 40 BC. Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, it also stipulated that he concede <a href="Roman%20Italy">Italia</a>, <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>, and <a href="Roman%20Gaul">Gaul</a>, and marry Octavian's sister <a href="Octavia%20the%20Younger">Octavia the Younger</a>, a potential rival for Cleopatra.

In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in <a href="Judea">Judea</a>. Herod had been installed as a <a href="Herodian%20Tetrarchy">tetrarch</a> there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Mattathias">Antigonus II Mattathias</a> of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty. The latter had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch <a href="Phasael">Phasael</a>, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him <a href="List%20of%20Hasmonean%20and%20Herodian%20rulers">king of Judea</a>. This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new <a href="Herodian%20kingdom">Herodian kingdom</a>.
Relations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but also sired her two children, <a href="Antonia%20the%20Elder">Antonia the Elder</a> in 39 BC and <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a> in 36 BC, and moved his headquarters to Athens. However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure. Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra. Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1 January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a>, where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC. With two <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a> granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Antony traveled to <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.

Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign. Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future. In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain, but also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him, yet would ultimately outlast him.

In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant, including nearly all of <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> (<a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>) minus <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, which remained in Roman hands. She also received <a href="Ptolemais%20Akko">Ptolemais Akko</a> (modern <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre, Israel</a>), a city that was established by Ptolemy II. Given her <a href="Seleucid%20dynasty">ancestral relations with the Seleucids</a>, she was granted the region of <a href="Coele-Syria">Coele-Syria</a> along the upper <a href="Orontes%20River">Orontes River</a>. She was even given the region surrounding <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a> in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod. At the expense of the <a href="List%20of%20Nabataean%20kings">Nabataean king</a> <a href="Malichus%20I">Malichus I</a> (a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the <a href="Nabataean%20Kingdom">Nabataean Kingdom</a> around the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aqaba">Gulf of Aqaba</a> on the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, including Ailana (modern <a href="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>, Jordan). To the west Cleopatra was handed <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene</a> along the Libyan coast, as well as <a href="Itanos">Itanos</a> and <a href="Olous">Olous</a> in <a href="Roman%20Crete">Roman Crete</a>. Although still administered by Roman officials, these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating <a href="Ptolemaic%20coinage">her coinage</a> in 36 BC.
Antony's enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly-controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian, who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic. Octavian, fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia, granted both her and <a href="Livia">Livia</a>, his own wife, extraordinary privileges of <a href="sacrosanctity">sacrosanctity</a>. Some 50 years before, <a href="Cornelia%20Africana">Cornelia Africana</a>, daughter of <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a>, had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her. She was now followed by Octavia and Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's, erected by Caesar.

In 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire. She then returned to Egypt, perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy. By the summer of 36 BC, she had given birth to <a href="Ptolemy%20Philadelphus%20%28son%20of%20Cleopatra%29">Ptolemy Philadelphus</a>, her second son with Antony.

<a href="Antony%27s%20Parthian%20War">Antony's Parthian campaign</a> in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons, in particular the betrayal of <a href="Artavasdes%20II%20of%20Armenia">Artavasdes II of Armenia</a>, who defected to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men, more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near <a href="Berytus">Berytus</a> (modern <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, Lebanon) in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.

As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">their ally Armenia</a>, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses. Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household. Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including <a href="Sextus%20Pompeius">Sextus Pompeius</a> and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after <a href="Sicilian%20revolt">revolting against Octavian in Sicily</a>.

Dellius was sent as Antony's envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential <a href="marriage%20alliance">marriage alliance</a> that would wed the Armenian king's daughter to Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra. When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family. Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph, dressed as <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra, who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais. News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.
In an event held at the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> soon after the triumph, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the <a href="Queen%20of%20Kings">Queen of Kings</a> with her son Caesarion, <a href="King%20of%20Kings">King of Kings</a>, while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia, <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Media</a>, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphos was declared king of Syria and Cilicia. Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene. Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony. Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, now known as the <a href="Donations%20of%20Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria</a>. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view.

In late 34 BC, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years. Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy, while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian. The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from <a href="Augustan%20literature%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Augustan-period literature</a> through to various media in modern times. Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with <a href="Magic%20in%20the%20Graeco-Roman%20world">witchcraft and sorcery</a> and was as dangerous as <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen of Troy</a> in destroying civilization. <a href="Horace">Horace</a>'s <a href="Satires%20%28Horace%29">"Satires"</a> preserved an account that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth 2.5 million drachmas in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet. The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the <a href="Library%20of%20Pergamum">Library of Pergamum</a> to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by <a href="Gaius%20Calvisius%20Sabinus%20%28consul%2039%20BC%29">Gaius Calvisius Sabinus</a>.

A <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> document dated to February 33 BC, later used to wrap a <a href="mummy">mummy</a>, contains the signature of Cleopatra, probably written by an official authorized to sign for her. It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or <a href="Publius%20Canidius%20Crassus">Publius Canidius Crassus</a>, a former Roman consul and Antony's confidant who would command his land forces at <a href="Actium">Actium</a>. A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads "make it happen" or "so be it" (); this is likely the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to <a href="Countersign%20%28legal%29">countersign</a> documents to avoid forgery.

In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Before Antony and Octavian's joint "<a href="imperium">imperium</a>" expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. On 1 January 32 BC the Antonian loyalists <a href="Gaius%20Sosius">Gaius Sosius</a> and <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Ahenobarbus%20%28consul%2032%20BC%29">Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus</a> were elected as consuls. On 1 February 32 BC Sosius gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls. Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.

Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire. Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian. Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch. Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt. Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans, such as Ahenobarbus and <a href="Lucius%20Munatius%20Plancus">Lucius Munatius Plancus</a>.

During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens, where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce. This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will, invested with the <a href="Vestal%20Virgin">Vestal Virgin</a>s. Although a violation of sacred and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the <a href="Temple%20of%20Vesta">Temple of Vesta</a>, and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian highlighted parts of the will, such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic. In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">his own mausoleum</a> at the <a href="Campus%20Martius">Campus Martius</a>. Octavian's legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC. With Antony's will made public, Octavian had his "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>", and Rome declared war on Cleopatra, not Antony. The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired.
Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian, but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained, some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force. Antony wanted to cross the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium, but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly. Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at <a href="Patrai">Patrai</a> in Greece, and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium, on the southern side of the <a href="Ambracian%20Gulf">Ambracian Gulf</a>.

Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings, but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod, and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign. They also lost the support of Malichus I, which would prove to have strategic consequences. Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC, while defections to Octavian's camp continued, including Antony's long-time companion Dellius and the allied kings <a href="Amyntas%20of%20Galatia">Amyntas of Galatia</a> and <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20the%20Paphlagonia">Deiotaros of Paphlagonia</a>. While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland, Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation, to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt.

On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a>, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a>. Cleopatra, aboard her flagship, the "Antonias", commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet, in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle. Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy, which Cleopatra, ever concerned about defending Egypt, used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible. Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship, identified by its <a href="Tyrian%20purple">distinctive purple</a> sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for <a href="Tainaron">Tainaron</a>. Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her. The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September, and was followed by massive defections of officers, troops, and allied kings to Octavian's side.

While Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at <a href="Paraitonion">Paraitonion</a> in Egypt. The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra sailing into the harbor at Alexandria in a misleading attempt to portray the activities in Greece as a victory. It is also uncertain if at this time she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, <a href="Artavasdes%20I%20of%20Media%20Atropatene">Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene</a>, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.

<a href="Lucius%20Pinarius">Lucius Pinarius</a>, Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court. Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian's side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain. Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers. In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of <a href="Pharos">Pharos</a> that he nicknamed the "Timoneion", after the philosopher <a href="Timon%20of%20Athens%20%28person%29">Timon of Athens</a>, who was famous for his cynicism and <a href="misanthropy">misanthropy</a>. Herod, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony. Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.

Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion. Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him, taking her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea and then setting sail to a foreign port, perhaps in <a href="History%20of%20India">India</a>, where she could spend time recuperating. However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I, as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria, <a href="Quintus%20Didius">Quintus Didius</a>, managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated. Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian. Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.
Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the "<a href="ephebi">ephebi</a>", which, along with reliefs on a stele from <a href="Koptos">Koptos</a> dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt. In a show of solidarity, Antony also had <a href="Marcus%20Antonius%20Antyllus">Marcus Antonius Antyllus</a>, his son with Fulvia, enter the "ephebi" at the same time. Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have only replied to Cleopatra. Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt, offering Octavian money in the future and immediately sending him lavish gifts. Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction. Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared, but when Antony suspected foul intent, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.

After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC, stopping at <a href="Ptolemais%20in%20Phoenicia">Ptolemais in Phoenicia</a>, where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies. Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while <a href="Cornelius%20Gallus">Cornelius Gallus</a>, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion. Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria, but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's <a href="hippodrome">hippodrome</a>. However, on 1 August 30 BC Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by his cavalry. Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants, sending a message to Antony that she had committed suicide. In despair, Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53. According to Plutarch, he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb, telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian's companion over anyone else in his entourage. It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures. Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.
Octavian entered Alexandria, occupied the palace, and seized Cleopatra's three youngest children. When she met with Octavian, she told him bluntly that "I will not be led in a triumph" () according to <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, a rare recording of her exact words. Octavian promised that he would keep her alive, but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom. When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. It is unclear if <a href="Death%20of%20Cleopatra">Cleopatra's suicide</a> in August 30 BC, at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb. It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and <a href="Charmion%20%28servant%20to%20Cleopatra%29">Charmion</a>, who also took their own lives. Octavian was said to be angered by this outcome but had her buried in royal fashion next to Antony in <a href="Tomb%20of%20Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">her tomb</a>. Cleopatra's physician Olympos did not explain her cause of death, although the popular belief is that she allowed an <a href="Asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a>, or <a href="Egyptian%20cobra">Egyptian cobra</a>, to bite and poison her. Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (, ,  'spine, cheese-grater') was used to introduce the toxin by scratching, while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (, ), and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> argued for an ointment of some kind. No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.

Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, perhaps with plans to flee to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kushite</a> <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, Ethiopia, or India. Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC, after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher <a href="Arius%20Didymus">Arius Didymus</a> that there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt</a> was established, marking the end of the Hellenistic period. In January 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus ("the revered") and <a href="Constitutional%20reforms%20of%20Augustus">amassed constitutional powers</a> that established him as the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>, inaugurating the <a href="Principate">Principate</a> era of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

Following the tradition of <a href="List%20of%20Macedonian%20kings">Macedonian rulers</a>, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an <a href="absolute%20monarch">absolute monarch</a>, serving as the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20law">sole lawgiver</a> of her kingdom. She was the <a href="High%20priest">chief religious authority</a> in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian</a> and <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> polytheistic faiths. She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the <a href="Jews%20in%20Egypt">Jews in Egypt</a>, and even built the <a href="Caesareum%20of%20Alexandria">Caesareum of Alexandria</a>, dedicated to the <a href="Imperial%20cult">cult worship</a> of her patron and lover Julius Caesar. Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain, tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign. Although the <a href="command%20economy">command economy</a> that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality, the government attempted to impose <a href="price%20controls">price controls</a>, <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, and <a href="state%20monopolies">state monopolies</a> for certain goods, fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons. Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to <a href="Debasement">debase</a> her coinage, which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.

After her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphos, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister <a href="Octavia%20the%20Younger">Octavia the Younger</a>, a former wife of their father, as their guardian. Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC. The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point. Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to <a href="Juba%20II">Juba II</a>, son of <a href="Juba%20I">Juba I</a>, whose North African <a href="kingdom%20of%20Numidia">kingdom of Numidia</a> had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey. The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, after their wedding in 25 BC, as the new rulers of <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>, where they transformed the old <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthaginian</a> city of <a href="Iol">Iol</a> into their new capital, renamed <a href="Caesarea%20Mauretaniae">Caesarea Mauretaniae</a> (modern <a href="Cherchell">Cherchell</a>, Algeria). Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars, artists, and advisers from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea, now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture. She also named her son <a href="Ptolemy%20of%20Mauretania">Ptolemy of Mauretania</a>, in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.

Cleopatra Selene II died around 5 BC, and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy. However, Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> in 40 AD, perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized <a href="regalia">regalia</a> reserved for the Roman emperor. Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, although Queen <a href="Zenobia">Zenobia</a>, of the short-lived <a href="Palmyrene%20Empire">Palmyrene Empire</a> during the <a href="Crisis%20of%20the%20Third%20Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a>, would claim descent from Cleopatra. A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe, an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis, explained that he "overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold."

Although almost 50 ancient works of <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historiography</a> mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies. Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Life of Antonius</a>" written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life. Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on <a href="primary%20source">primary source</a>s, such as <a href="Philotas%20%28physician%29">Philotas of Amphissa</a>, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports. The <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Jewish Roman</a> historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, writing in the 1st century AD, provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great. However, this work relies largely on Herod's memoirs and the biased account of <a href="Nicolaus%20of%20Damascus">Nicolaus of Damascus</a>, the tutor of Cleopatra's children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod's court. The "Roman History" published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD, while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra's reign.
Cleopatra is barely mentioned in , the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar. The <a href="writings%20of%20Cicero">writings of Cicero</a>, who knew her personally, provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra. The Augustan-period authors <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime, although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>. Horace also viewed Cleopatra's suicide as a positive choice, an idea that found acceptance by the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> with <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>. The historians <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, <a href="Velleius">Velleius</a>, <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, and <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch, Josephus, or Dio, provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records. Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some <a href="List%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20papyri">Egyptian papyrus documents</a> demonstrate Cleopatra's point of view, but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works. The fragmentary "Libyka" commissioned by Cleopatra's son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra's perspective.

Cleopatra's gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient, medieval, and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>. For instance, the historian <a href="Ronald%20Syme">Ronald Syme</a> asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree. Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress, she had only two known sexual partners, Caesar and Antony, the two most prominent Romans of the time period, who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty. Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.

Cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> as well as <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic-Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20art">Roman</a> styles. Surviving works include statues, <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">busts</a>, <a href="relief">relief</a>s, and minted coins, as well as ancient <a href="Cameo%20%28carving%29">carved cameos</a>, such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the <a href="Altes%20Museum">Altes Museum</a>, Berlin. Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance, a large <a href="Gilding">gilded</a> bronze statue of Cleopatra once existed inside the <a href="Temple%20of%20Venus%20Genetrix">Temple of Venus Genetrix</a> in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a <a href="Roman%20temple">Roman temple</a>. It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.

In regards to surviving Roman statuary, was found near the , Rome, along the and is now housed in the , part of the <a href="Vatican%20Museums">Vatican Museums</a>. Plutarch, in his "Life of Antonius", claimed that the public statues of Antony were <a href="damnatio%20memoriae">torn down</a> by Augustus, but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2,000 <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talents</a> to dissuade him from destroying hers.

Since the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the "<a href="Esquiline%20Venus">Esquiline Venus</a>"—discovered in 1874 on the <a href="Esquiline%20Hill">Esquiline Hill</a> in Rome and housed in the of the <a href="Capitoline%20Museums">Capitoline Museums</a>—is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue's , apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the <a href="uraeus">uraeus</a> <a href="Egyptian%20cobra">Egyptian cobra</a> wrapped around the base. Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> (or the Greek <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>). However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite. She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos. The "Esquiline Venus" is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD <a href="Interpretatio%20graeca">Roman copy</a> of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of <a href="Pasiteles">Pasiteles</a>.

Surviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC. Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins. Cleopatra was also the first foreign queen to have her image appear on <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman currency</a>. Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar <a href="aquiline%20nose">aquiline nose</a> and prominent chin as that of her husband. These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple. Her strong, almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother, softer, and perhaps idealized <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">sculpted images</a> of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles. Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father, <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII Auletes</a>, and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor <a href="Arsinoe%20II">Arsinoe II</a> (316–260 BC) and even depictions of earlier queens such as <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> and <a href="Nefertiti">Nefertiti</a>. It is likely, due to political expediency, that Antony's visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her <a href="Macedon">Macedonian Greek</a> ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.

The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek, but also in the <a href="nominative%20case">nominative case</a> of Roman coins rather than the <a href="genitive%20case">genitive case</a> of Greek coins, in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones. These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and <a href="Hellenistic%20culture">Hellenistic culture</a>, and perhaps also a statement to their subjects, however ambiguous to modern scholars, about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other. <a href="Diana%20Kleiner">Diana Kleiner</a> argues that Cleopatra, in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony, made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable <a href="Patronage%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman client queen</a> than a Hellenistic ruler. Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony, such as the coins struck at the <a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a> mint during her brief period of exile to <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, which <a href="Joann%20Fletcher">Joann Fletcher</a> explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.

Various coins, such as a silver <a href="tetradrachm">tetradrachm</a> minted sometime after Cleopatra's marriage with Antony in 37 BC, depict her wearing a royal diadem and a <a href="Greco-Roman%20hairstyle">'melon' hairstyle</a>. The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads. This hairstyle, with hair braided back into a bun, is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and <a href="Berenice%20II">Berenice II</a> in their own coinage. After her visit to Rome in 46–44 BC it became fashionable for <a href="Women%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman women</a> to adopt it as one of <a href="Roman%20hairstyles">their hairstyles</a>, but it was abandoned for a more modest, austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.

Of the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, the sculpture known as the "", located in the <a href="Antikensammlung%20Berlin">Antikensammlung Berlin</a> collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the "", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose. Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix. Both heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the <a href="Via%20Appia">Via Appia</a> in Italy, the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the <a href="Villa%20of%20the%20Quintilii">Villa of the Quintilii</a>. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose. A third accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the <a href="Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Cherchell">Archaeological Museum of Cherchell</a>, Algeria. This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads, but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Cleopatra. A possible <a href="Parian%20marble">Parian-marble</a> wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums. Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC, it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.

Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, London, made of limestone, which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome. The woman in has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose), but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle. However, the British Museum head, once belonging to a full statue, could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome. <a href="Duane%20W.%20Roller">Duane W. Roller</a> speculates that the British Museum head, along with those in the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum</a>, Cairo, the Capitoline Museums, and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen, while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem, most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra's popular hairstyle.

In the at <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, Italy, a mid-1st century BC <a href="Pompeian%20Styles">Second Style</a> wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a <a href="cupid">cupid</a> near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as <a href="Venus%20Genetrix">Venus Genetrix</a> with her son Caesarion. The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the <a href="Forum%20of%20Caesar">Forum of Caesar</a> in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra. This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as . The wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra, which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid's arm may have been torn off. The room with the painting was walled off by its owner, perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian, when public depictions of Cleopatra's son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime. Behind her golden diadem, crowned with a red jewel, is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the "melon" hairstyle favored by the queen. Her <a href="Light%20skin">ivory-white skin</a>, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities. Roller affirms that "there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen."
, dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II, contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion, both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide. The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman <a href="Sophonisba">Sophonisba</a>, who toward the end of the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> (218–201 BC) drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover <a href="Masinissa">Masinissa</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Numidia">King of Numidia</a>. Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family, Masinissa and <a href="Ptolemy%20VIII%20Physcon">Ptolemy VIII Physcon</a> having been associates, and Cleopatra's own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II. Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made, while Cleopatra's suicide was far more famous. An asp is absent from the painting, but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite. A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting, positioned very high above the people in it, suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria. A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial <a href="Nile%20crocodile">Egyptian crocodile</a> (possibly an elaborate tray handle), while another man standing by is <a href="Toga">dressed as a Roman</a>.

In 1818 a now lost <a href="encaustic%20painting">encaustic painting</a> was discovered in the Temple of <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a> at <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Villa">Hadrian's Villa</a>, near <a href="Tivoli%2C%20Lazio">Tivoli, Lazio</a>, Italy, that with an asp biting her bare chest. A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third <a href="wax">wax</a> and two-thirds <a href="resin">resin</a>. The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra's bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the <a href="Fayum%20mummy%20portraits">Fayum mummy portraits</a>. A <a href="steel%20engraving">steel engraving</a> published by <a href="John%20Sartain">John Sartain</a> in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing <a href="Clothing%20in%20ancient%20Greece">authentic clothing</a> and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period, as well as the <a href="radiant%20crown">radiant crown</a> of the Ptolemaic rulers, as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns. After Cleopatra's suicide, Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake, parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome. The portrait painting of Cleopatra's death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> to decorate his private villa, where it was found in an <a href="Egyptian%20temple">Egyptian temple</a>.

A Roman <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a> from <a href="Herculaneum">Herculaneum</a>, Italy, dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra. In it she wears a royal diadem, red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun, pearl-studded hairpins, and earrings with ball-shaped pendants, . Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage. A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the <a href="House%20of%20the%20Orchard">House of the Orchard</a> at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery, such as a Greek-style <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a>, and may have been created by the same artist.

The <a href="Portland%20Vase">Portland Vase</a>, a <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman</a> <a href="cameo%20glass">cameo glass</a> vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony. In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs, <a href="Eros">Eros</a> floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom. The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus. The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.

The "<a href="Bust%20of%20Cleopatra">Bust of Cleopatra</a>" in the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style. Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt. The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art. The <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">Dendera Temple complex</a>, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20offering%20formula">offerings to the gods</a>. Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.

A large Ptolemaic black <a href="basalt">basalt</a> statue measuring in height, now in the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, is thought to represent Arsinoe II, wife of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a>, but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress, an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower</a> and <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>. The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided, double <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a> ("dikeras"), which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra. In his (2006), contends that this basalt statue, like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance. <a href="Adrian%20Goldsworthy">Adrian Goldsworthy</a> writes that, despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style, Cleopatra would have only dressed as a native "perhaps for certain rites" and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch, which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.

In modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films. This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter. The 14th-century English poet <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, in "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Good%20Women">The Legend of Good Women</a>", contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining <a href="knight">knight</a> engaged in <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a>, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire. However, Chaucer highlighted Cleopatra's relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in and , Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a>. The <a href="Renaissance%20humanist">Renaissance humanist</a> , in his 1504 "Libretto apologetico delle donne", was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works. Works of Islamic historiography <a href="Arabic%20literature">written in Arabic</a> covered the reign of Cleopatra, such as the 10th-century "<a href="The%20Meadows%20of%20Gold">Meadows of Gold</a>" by <a href="Al-Masudi">Al-Masudi</a>, although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra's suicide.

Cleopatra appeared in <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniatures</a> for <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s, such as a lying in a <a href="International%20Gothic">Gothic-style</a> tomb by the <a href="Boucicaut%20Master">Boucicaut Master</a> in 1409. In the visual arts, the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors <a href="Bartolommeo%20Bandinelli">Bartolommeo Bandinelli</a> and <a href="Alessandro%20Vittoria">Alessandro Vittoria</a>. <a href="Old%20master%20print">Early prints</a> depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> and <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, as well as 15th-century <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s in illustrated editions of Boccaccio's works.

In the <a href="performing%20arts">performing arts</a>, the death of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a> in 1603, and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra, inspired <a href="Samuel%20Daniel">Samuel Daniel</a> to alter and republish his 1594 play "Cleopatra" in 1607. He was followed by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, whose "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", largely based on Plutarch, was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England's own <a href="Virgin%20Queen">Virgin Queen</a>. Cleopatra was also featured in operas, such as <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s 1724 "<a href="Giulio%20Cesare%20in%20Egitto">Giulio Cesare in Egitto</a>", which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra.

In <a href="Victorian%20Britain">Victorian Britain</a>, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient <a href="Egyptian%20culture">Egyptian culture</a> and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a>s, postcards and cigarettes. <a href="Victorian%20literature">Fictional novels</a> such as <a href="H.%20Rider%20Haggard">H. Rider Haggard</a>'s "<a href="Cleopatra%20%28Haggard%20novel%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1889) and <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a>'s "<a href="One%20of%20Cleopatra%27s%20Nights">One of Cleopatra's Nights</a>" (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist <a href="Georg%20Ebers">Georg Ebers</a>'s "Cleopatra" (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy. The French <a href="dramatist">dramatist</a> <a href="Victorien%20Sardou">Victorien Sardou</a> and Irish playwright <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> produced plays about Cleopatra, while <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesque</a> shows such as <a href="F.%20C.%20Burnand">F. C. Burnand</a>'s "Antony and Cleopatra" offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age. Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" was considered canonical by the Victorian era. Its popularity led to the perception that by <a href="Lawrence%20Alma-Tadema">Lawrence Alma-Tadema</a> depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus, although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria. In his unfinished 1825 short story "", <a href="Alexander%20Pushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian <a href="Aurelius%20Victor">Aurelius Victor</a>, previously largely ignored, that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives. Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East, as the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing-dynasty</a> Chinese scholar <a href="Yan%20Fu">Yan Fu</a> wrote an extensive biography of her.

<a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>'s "<a href="Robbing%20Cleopatra%27s%20Tomb">Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb</a>" (), an 1899 French <a href="Silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra. <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media, which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by <a href="Theda%20Bara">Theda Bara</a> in "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281917%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1917), <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> in "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281934%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1934), and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> in "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1963). In addition to her portrayal as a "<a href="vampire">vampire</a>" queen, Bara's Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century <a href="Orientalist%20painting">Orientalist painting</a>, such as <a href="despotism">despotic behavior</a>, mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality. Colbert's character of Cleopatra served as a <a href="glamour%20model">glamour model</a> for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s, targeting female moviegoers. In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra, <a href="women%27s%20magazines">women's magazines</a> of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup, clothes, jewelry, and hairstyles to achieve the "Egyptian" look similar to the queens Cleopatra and <a href="Nefertiti">Nefertiti</a>. By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three separate films, two hundred plays and novels, forty-five operas, and five <a href="ballet">ballet</a>s associated with Cleopatra.

Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces, administrative acts, and publications on <a href="ancient%20Greek%20medicine">ancient Greek medicine</a>. Only fragments exist of the medical and cosmetic writings attributed to Cleopatra, such as those preserved by <a href="Galen">Galen</a>, including remedies for <a href="hair%20disease">hair disease</a>, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20units%20of%20measurement">weights and measures</a> for <a href="Pharmacology">pharmacological</a> purposes. <a href="A%C3%ABtius%20of%20Amida">Aëtius of Amida</a> attributed a recipe for <a href="History%20of%20perfume">perfumed</a> soap to Cleopatra, while <a href="Paul%20of%20Aegina">Paul of Aegina</a> preserved alleged instructions of hers for <a href="Hair%20coloring">dyeing and curling hair</a>. The attribution of certain texts to Cleopatra, however, is doubted by Ingrid D. Rowland, who highlights that the "Berenice called Cleopatra" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician <a href="Metrodora">Metrodora</a> was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra.

Cleopatra belonged to the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian Greek</a> dynasty of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemies</a>, their <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Europe">European origins</a> tracing back to <a href="northern%20Greece">northern Greece</a>. Through her father, <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII Auletes</a>, she was a descendant of two <a href="Somatophylakes">prominent companions</a> of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> of <a href="History%20of%20Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a>: the general <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a>, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I Nicator</a>, the Macedonian Greek founder of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> of West Asia. While Cleopatra's <a href="Patrilineality">paternal line</a> can be traced through her father, the identity of her mother is unknown. She was presumably the daughter of <a href="Cleopatra%20VI%20Tryphaena">Cleopatra VI Tryphaena</a> (also known as <a href="Cleopatra%20V%20Tryphaena">Cleopatra V Tryphaena</a>), the cousin-wife or sister-wife of Ptolemy XII.

<a href="Cleopatra%20I%20Syra">Cleopatra I Syra</a> was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry, being a descendant of <a href="Apama">Apama</a>, the <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>n <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> wife of Seleucus I. It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>. <a href="Michael%20Grant%20%28classicist%29">Michael Grant</a> asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and "would have described herself as Greek." <a href="Stacy%20Schiff">Stacy Schiff</a> writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress. <a href="Duane%20W.%20Roller">Duane W. Roller</a> speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a> in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a> (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship), but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most. <a href="Ernle%20Bradford">Ernle Bradford</a> writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman "but as a civilized Greek."

Claims that Cleopatra was an <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a> child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her. Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate. Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife. The high degree of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below. The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V, Ptolemy XII's wife, as a daughter of <a href="Ptolemy%20X%20Alexander%20I">Ptolemy X Alexander I</a> and <a href="Berenice%20III">Berenice III</a>, which would make her a cousin of her husband, Ptolemy XII, but she could have been a daughter of <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX Lathyros</a>, which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead. The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII's wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII, and some use her as an indication that Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII's exile in Rome).
