Kragujevac massacre

The Kragujevac massacre was the <a href="mass%20murder">mass murder</a> of between 2,778 and 2,794 mostly <a href="Serbs">Serb</a> men and boys in <a href="Kragujevac">Kragujevac</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> soldiers on 21 October 1941. It occurred in the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and came in <a href="reprisal">reprisal</a> for insurgent attacks in the <a href="Gornji%20Milanovac">Gornji Milanovac</a> district that resulted in the deaths of 10 German soldiers and the wounding of 26 others. The number of hostages to be shot was calculated as a ratio of 100 hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50 hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.

After a punitive operation was conducted in the surrounding villages, during which over 400 males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70 male <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="communism">communists</a> who had been arrested in Kragujevac were killed. Simultaneously, males between the ages of 16 and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local <a href="collaborationism">collaborators</a>, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, and their bodies buried in <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300 hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000 deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800 killed, including 144 high school students. As well as Serbs, massacre victims included Jews, <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Serbia">Romani people</a>, <a href="Islam%20in%20Serbia">Muslims</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Macedonians</a>, <a href="Slovenes">Slovenes</a> and members of other nationalities.

Several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a> and the <a href="subsequent%20Nuremberg%20trials">subsequent Nuremberg trials</a>. The massacre had a profound effect on the course of the <a href="World%20War%20II%20in%20Yugoslavia">war in Yugoslavia</a>. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a> and the royalist, <a href="Serbian%20nationalism">Serbian nationalist</a> <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>, and convinced Chetnik leader <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a> that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100 executions for one soldier killed and 50 executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the <a href="October%20in%20Kragujevac%20Memorial%20Park">October in Kragujevac Memorial Park</a> and the co-located 21st October Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.

Following the 1938 "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" between <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="First%20Austrian%20Republic">Austria</a>, Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">invaded</a> and occupied neighbouring <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281928%E2%80%9339%29">Albania</a>. At the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its <a href="Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutrality</a>. Between September and November 1940, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a> joined the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>, aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy <a href="Greco-Italian%20War">invaded Greece</a>. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained. In late February 1941, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Intending to secure his southern flank for the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">impending attack</a> on the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, German dictator <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, <a href="Serbian%20nationalism">Serbian nationalist</a> <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Air Force</a> officers deposed the country's <a href="regent">regent</a>, <a href="Prince%20Paul%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prince Paul</a>, in a bloodless <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. They placed his teenage nephew <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Yugoslavia">Peter</a> on the throne and brought to power a "government of national unity" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Simovi%C4%87">Dušan Simović</a>. The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country's <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion</a>, which commenced on 6 April 1941.

Yugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. The <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> was limited to the pre-<a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan War</a> borders of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a> and was directly occupied by the Germans for the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, as well as its valuable resources, particularly <a href="non-ferrous%20metals">non-ferrous metals</a>. The occupied territory covered about and had a population of 3.8 million. Hitler had briefly considered erasing all existence of a Serbian state, but this was quickly abandoned and the Germans began searching for a Serb suitable to lead a <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a> in Belgrade. They initially settled on <a href="Milan%20A%C4%87imovi%C4%87">Milan Aćimović</a>, a staunch <a href="anti-communism">anti-communist</a> who served as Yugoslavia's <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Minister of Internal Affairs</a> in late 1939 and early 1940.

Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">communist</a>-led, multi-ethnic <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a>, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted almost entirely of Serbs. The Partisans were led by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>; the Chetniks were led by <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a>, an officer in the interwar <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a>. The two movements had widely divergent goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war "<a href="status%20quo">status quo</a>", whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored. Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities. By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans. The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders had ample military experience, having fought in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Within several months of the invasion, they had 8,000 fighters spread across 21 <a href="detachment%20%28military%29">detachments</a> in Serbia alone. Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World War I or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. They boasted around 20,000 fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia at the time of the massacre.

On 29 August, the Germans replaced Aćimović with another fervent anti-communist, the former <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Minister of the Army and Navy</a> and <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, General <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a>, who formed a <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Salvation">new puppet government</a>. In September, the Nedić government was permitted to form the <a href="Serbian%20Volunteer%20Corps%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Serbian Volunteer Command</a> (; SDK), an auxiliary <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> formation to help quell anti-German resistance. In effect, the SDK was the military arm of the <a href="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="Yugoslav%20National%20Movement">Yugoslav National Movement</a> (, "Zbor"), led by <a href="Dimitrije%20Ljoti%C4%87">Dimitrije Ljotić</a>. It was originally intended to have a strength of 3,000–4,000 troops, but this number eventually rose to 12,000. It was headed by <a href="Kosta%20Mu%C5%A1icki">Kosta Mušicki</a>, a former colonel in the Royal Yugoslav Army, whom Nedić appointed on 6 October 1941. In the early stages of the occupation, the SDK formed the bulk of Nedić's forces, which numbered around 20,000 men by late 1941.

Nedić's inability to crush the Partisans and Chetniks prompted the Military Commander in Serbia to request German reinforcements from other parts of the continent. In mid-September, they transferred the 125th Infantry Regiment from Greece and the <a href="342nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">342nd Infantry Division</a> from France to help put down the uprising in Serbia. On 16 September, Hitler issued Directive No. 312 to "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (<a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a>) <a href="Wilhelm%20List">Wilhelm List</a>, the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>" commander in Southeast Europe, ordering him to suppress all resistance in that part of the continent. That same day, the <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Supreme Command of the Armed Forces</a> ("Oberkommando der Wehrmacht"; OKW) issued Hitler's order on the suppression of "Communist Armed Resistance Movements in the Occupied Areas", signed by "Generalfeldmarschall" <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a>. This decree specified that all attacks against the Germans on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> were to be "regarded as being of communist origin", and that 100 hostages were to be shot for every German soldier killed and 50 were to be shot for every German soldier wounded. It was intended to apply to all of <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, though an identical policy had already been implemented in Serbia as early as 28 April 1941, aimed at deterring guerrilla attacks. Attacks against the Germans increased in the first half of the year and Serbia once again became a warzone. German troops fanned through the countryside burning villages, taking hostages and establishing concentration camps. The first mass executions of hostages commenced in July.

The strengthening of Germany's military presence in Serbia resulted in a new wave of mass executions and <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s. The commanders who bore the most responsibility for these atrocities were primarily of Austrian origin and had served in the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Most were ardently <a href="Anti-Serb%20sentiment">anti-Serb</a>, a prejudice that the historian <a href="Stevan%20K.%20Pavlowitch">Stevan K. Pavlowitch</a> links to the Nazis' wider anti-<a href="Slavs">Slavic</a> racism.

On 19 September, "<a href="General%20der%20Gebirgstruppe">General der Gebirgstruppe</a>" (<a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a>) <a href="Franz%20B%C3%B6hme">Franz Böhme</a> was appointed as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia, with direct responsibility for quelling the revolt, bringing with him the staff of <a href="XVIII%20Army%20Corps%20%28Wehrmacht%29">XVIII Mountain Corps</a>. He was allocated additional forces to assist him in doing so, reinforcing the three German occupation divisions already in the territory. These divisions were the <a href="104th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">704th Infantry Division</a>, <a href="114th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">714th Infantry Division</a> and <a href="117th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">717th Infantry Division</a>. Böhme boasted a profound hatred of Serbs and encouraged his predominantly Austrian-born troops to exact "vengeance" against them. His primary grievances were the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and subsequent Austro-Hungarian military defeats at the hands of the <a href="Royal%20Serbian%20Army">Royal Serbian Army</a>, which he thought could only be rectified by the reprisal shooting of Serbian civilians. "Your objective," Böhme declared, "is to be achieved in a land where, in 1914, streams of German blood flowed because of the treachery of the Serbs, men and women. You are the avengers of those dead."

On 28 September, the 6th Company of the German 920th "Landesschützen" (Local Defence) Battalion was captured by insurgents in the town of <a href="Gornji%20Milanovac">Gornji Milanovac</a>. According to the journalist <a href="Misha%20Glenny">Misha Glenny</a>, the Partisans launched an attack on a small German detachment based at a local school. They did not expect to capture the German garrison, but undertook the attack in order to generate new recruits from the surrounding area. The local Chetnik commander, , became aware of the Partisan plans and decided to join in the attack to avoid the significant loss of prestige that would result from allowing the Partisans to attack alone. The insurgents launched a morning attack against the school. Although they were successful in overrunning the sentry posts, the Germans' heavy <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s soon stopped the assault. In 90 minutes of fighting, 10 Germans were killed and 26 wounded. The two insurgent groups judged that continuing the assault would be too costly and Vučković suggested negotiating with the Germans. To the insurgents' surprise, the Germans surrendered. They were then taken away by Vučković and his men.

A German officer who escaped reported that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme became aware of the situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III. Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the <a href="117th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">717th Infantry Division</a>, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6 October, and released the 170 hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and on 15 October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16 October.

On 15–16 October, 10 German soldiers were killed and 14 wounded during a joint Partisan-Chetnik attack on <a href="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a>, a city about south of <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and southeast of Gornji Milanovac. On 15 October, troops of the 717th Infantry Division shot 300 civilians from Kraljevo in reprisal. These reprisal killings continued over the following days, and by 17 or 20 October, German troops had rounded up and shot 1,736 men and 19 "communist" women from the city and its outskirts, despite attempts by local collaborationists to mitigate the punishment. These executions were personally supervised by the commander of the 717th Infantry Division, "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" (<a href="Brigadier%20general">Brigadier General</a>) <a href="Paul%20Hoffmann%20%28general%29">Paul Hoffman</a>.

Kragujevac is an <a href="industrial%20district">industrial city</a> in <a href="Central%20Serbia">Central Serbia</a>, about south of Belgrade, and east of Gornji Milanovac. It had a population of more than 40,000 in 1941, and was the headquarters of a German military district. The city was also home to <a href="Zastava%20Arms">Yugoslavia's largest armaments factory</a>, which had between 7,000 and 8,000 workers before the invasion.

A report was written by the military district commander in Kragujevac, "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" (<a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">Captain</a>) Otto von Bischofhausen, immediately after the massacre. This report was addressed to Böhme, and was later tendered in evidence at the <a href="Subsequent%20Nuremberg%20trials">Subsequent Nuremberg trials</a>. According to von Bischofhausen, in the late evening of 18 October, all male <a href="Jews">Jews</a> in Kragujevac, along with some communists, were arrested according to lists, totalling 70 persons. As this constituted far too few hostages to meet the quota of 2,300, it was proposed to collect the balance by arrests on the streets, squares and houses of Kragujevac, in an operation to be conducted by III./749th Infantry Regiment, and I. Battalion of the 724th Infantry Regiment, part of the 704th Infantry Division. In response to this proposal, von Bischofhausen claimed that he suggested to the garrison commander, <a href="Major">Major</a> Paul König, that, instead of using the population of Kragujevac, the required hostages be gathered from surrounding villages which were known to be "completely strewn with communists". According to von Bischofhausen's account, this suggestion was initially accepted by König, and, on 19 October, III./749th Infantry Regiment "mopped up" the villages of Mečkovac and Maršić, and I./724th Infantry Regiment conducted a similar operation in the villages of <a href="Gro%C5%A1nica">Grošnica</a> and Milatovac. A total of 422 men were shot in these four villages, without any German losses.

On the evening of 19 October, von Bischofhausen again met with König and was told that the original proposal was to be implemented the following day in order to collect the 2,300 hostages. The following evening, the male Jews and communists, who had been held without food since their arrest, were shot by German troops at the barracks and courtyard where they were being held. Simultaneously, males between the ages of 16 and 60 were arrested within Kragujevac itself. They were detained in the barracks of a former motorised battalion at Stanovija Field. Over 7,000 hostages were assembled. German troops and <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">ethnic German</a> units from the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a> were involved in the round-up, as was the Fifth Regiment of the SDK, under the command of Marisav Petrović. According to von Bischofhausen, König permitted several classes of males to be excluded from the round-up, including those with a special pass issued by von Bischofhausen's district headquarters, members of a vital profession or trade, and those who were members of Ljotić's movement. When too few adult males could be located, high school students were also rounded up. Also seized were priests and monks from the city's churches. Each hostage was registered and his belongings noted meticulously.

The hostages were held overnight on a public plaza in the town. In his version of events, von Bischofhausen claimed that he made objections to König, but the latter insisted that his orders, which had been issued by the commander of the 749th Infantry Regiment, would be carried out. Shortly before the executions commenced, Ljotić obtained approval for two "Zbor" officials to scrutinise the hostages. Over 3,000 individuals, those identified as being "genuine nationalists" and "real patriots", were excluded from the execution lists as a result of Ljotić's intervention. Those who were not extracted from the hostage pool were accused of being communists or spreading "communist propaganda". The "Zbor" officials told them they were not "worth saving" because they had "infected the younger generation with their leftist ideas." The Germans considered "Zbor"'s involvement to be a "nuisance". According to the <a href="social%20science">social scientist</a> Jovan Byford, it was never intended or likely to reduce the overall number of hostages killed in reprisal, and served only to ensure the exclusion of those that were deemed by "Zbor" to be worth saving.

On the morning of 21 October, the assembled men and boys were marched to a field outside the town. Over a period of seven hours, they were lined up in groups of 50 to 120 and shot with heavy machine guns. "Go ahead and shoot", said an elderly teacher, "I am conducting my class". He was shot together with his students. As they faced the <a href="firing%20squad">firing squad</a>, many hostages sang the patriotic song "<a href="Hey%2C%20Slavs">Hey, Slavs</a>", which became Yugoslavia's <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a> after the war. One German soldier was shot for refusing to participate in the killings. A German report stated: "The executions in Kragujevac occurred although there had been no attacks on members of the Wehrmacht in this city, for the reason that not enough hostages could be found elsewhere." Even some German <a href="informant">informant</a>s were inadvertently killed. "Clearly", the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> historian Mark Levene writes, "Germans in uniform were not "that" particular about who they shot in reprisal, especially in the Balkans, where the populace were deemed subhuman."

Following the massacre, the Germans held a military parade through the city centre. On 31 October, Böhme sent a report to the acting Wehrmacht commander in Southeast Europe, "<a href="General%20der%20Pioniere">General der Pioniere</a>" (Lieutenant General) <a href="Walter%20Kuntze">Walter Kuntze</a>, reporting that 2,300 hostages had been shot in Kragujevac.

The Partisan commander and later historian <a href="Milovan%20Djilas">Milovan Djilas</a> recalled how the Kragujevac massacre gripped all of Serbia in "deadly terror". Throughout the war, local collaborators pressured the Germans to implement stringent vetting procedures to ensure that "innocent civilians" were not executed, though only when the hostages were ethnic Serbs. By the time Böhme was relieved as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in December 1941, between 20,000 and 30,000 civilians had been killed in German reprisal shootings. The ratio of 100 executions for each soldier killed and 50 executions for each soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy <a href="Hermann%20Neubacher">Hermann Neubacher</a>. The massacres in Kragujevac and Kraljevo caused German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of such killings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. In Kraljevo, the entire Serbian workforce of an airplane factory producing armaments for the Germans was shot. This helped convince the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also counterproductive.

The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo exacerbated tensions between the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile for as long as the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain <a href="Bill%20Hudson%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Bill Hudson</a>, a <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> officer, met with Mihailović at his <a href="Ravna%20Gora%20%28Suvobor%29">Ravna Gora</a> headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," he recounted, "because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović." "The tragedy gave to Nedić convincing proof that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," Djilas wrote, "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans". Mihailović's decision to refrain from attacking the Germans led to a rift with Tito and the Partisans. The Chetniks' non-resistance made it easier for the Germans to confront the Partisans, who for much of the remainder of the war could not defeat them in open combat.

List and Böhme were both captured at the end of the war. On 10 May 1947, they were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of the <a href="Hostages%20Trial">Hostages Trial</a> of the subsequent Nuremberg trials. One of the crimes specifically listed in Count 1 of the indictment was the massacre of 2,300 hostages in Kragujevac. Böhme committed suicide before his <a href="arraignment">arraignment</a>. List was found guilty on Count 1, as well as on another count. He was sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> in 1948, but was released due to ill health in 1953. Despite this, he lived until June 1971. Keitel was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the <a href="Nuremberg%20Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a>, and subsequently hanged. Hoffmann, whom the local population dubbed the "butcher of Kraljevo and Kragujevac", was promoted to command the more capable <a href="352nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">352nd Infantry Division</a> in November 1941. He ended the war as the commander of a <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>, having been demoted for refusing to shoot deserters in the Ukraine. The 717th Infantry Division was reorganised as the 117th Jäger Division later in the war and its troops took part in the <a href="Massacre%20of%20Kalavryta">massacre</a> of hundreds of Greek civilians at <a href="Kalavryta">Kalavryta</a> in December 1943.

At least 31 mass graves were discovered in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian <a href="Jozo%20Tomasevich">Jozo Tomasevich</a> wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300 hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed that the number of victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some estimates of the number of those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000 victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21st October Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794 victims. Of the total killed, 144 were high school students, and five of the victims were 12 years old. The last living survivor of the massacre, Dragoljub Jovanović, died in October 2018 at the age of 94. He survived despite sustaining 11 bullet wounds and had to have one of his legs amputated. After the war, he was appointed the inaugural director of the 21st October Museum.

The massacre at Kragujevac came to symbolize the brutality of the German occupation in Yugoslav popular memory. It has drawn comparisons to the Germans' <a href="Lidice%20massacre">destruction</a> of the Czechoslovak village of <a href="Lidice">Lidice</a> in June 1942 and the <a href="Oradour-sur-Glane%20massacre">massacre</a> of the inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane, in France, in June 1944. To commemorate the victims of the Kragujevac massacre, the whole of Šumarice, where the killings took place, was designated a memorial park in 1953. It is now known as the <a href="October%20in%20Kragujevac%20Memorial%20Park">October in Kragujevac Memorial Park</a>, and covers encompassing the area that contains the mass graves. The 21st October Museum was founded within the park on 15 February 1976. There are also several monuments within the park, including the "Interrupted Flight" monument to the murdered high school students and their teachers, and the monuments "Pain and Defiance", "One Hundred for One", and "Resistance and Freedom". The Memorial Park website notes that the victims of the massacre included Serbs, Jews, <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Serbia">Romani people</a>, <a href="Islam%20in%20Serbia">Muslims</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Macedonians</a>, <a href="Slovenes">Slovenes</a> and members of other nationalities. The memorial was damaged during the <a href="NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">NATO bombing of Yugoslavia</a> in 1999.

The Serbian poet and writer <a href="Desanka%20Maksimovi%C4%87">Desanka Maksimović</a> wrote a poem about the massacre titled "Krvava bajka" ("A Bloody Fairy Tale"). The poem was later included in the Yugoslav secondary school curriculum and schoolchildren were required to memorise it. It ranks among the most famous Serbian-language poems. In 1965, the Belgian poet <a href="Karel%20Jonckheere">Karel Jonckheere</a> wrote the poem "Kinderen met krekelstem" ("Children with Cricket Voices"), also about the massacre. "The Blue Butterfly", a book of poetry by <a href="Richard%20Berengarten">Richard Berengarten</a>, is based on the poet's experiences while visiting Kragujevac in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on his hand at the entrance to the memorial museum.

The massacre has been the subject of two feature films: "Prozvan je i " (" is Called Out"; 1962) and "Krvava bajka" ("A Bloody Fairy Tale"; 1969), named after the eponymous poem. In 2012, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Serbia%29">National Assembly of Serbia</a> passed a law declaring 21 October a <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a>, the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.

Russian battleship Pobeda

Pobeda () was the last of the three <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> at the end of the nineteenth century. The ship was assigned to the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Squadron</a> upon completion and based at <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> from 1903. During the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–1905, she participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">battles of Port Arthur</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a>. Having escaped serious damage in these engagements, "Pobeda" was sunk by <a href="siege%20gun">gunfire</a> during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Siege of Port Arthur</a>, and then <a href="marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> by the Japanese and placed into service under the name .

Rearmed and re-boilered by the Japanese, "Suwo" was reclassified by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) as a <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> in 1908 and served as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for several years. She was the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Japanese squadron that participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsingtao">Battle of Tsingtao</a> at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training ship in 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> and probably <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> around that time.

The design of the "Peresvet" class was inspired by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">British</a> second-class battleships (typically faster, but with thinner armor and smaller guns than first-class battleships) of the . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s like the Russian ships and , and the "Peresvet" class was designed to support the armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.

"Pobeda" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . Designed to displace , she was almost overweight and displaced . Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a> using steam generated by 30 <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s. The engines were rated at , using <a href="forced%20draught">forced draught</a>, and designed to reach a top speed of . "Pobeda", however, reached a top speed of from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in October 1901. She carried a maximum of of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of .

The ship's <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of four <a href="254mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201891"></a> guns mounted in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of eleven <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) guns</a>, mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>. Smaller guns were carried for defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. These included twenty <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> QF guns, twenty <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s and eight guns. She was also armed with five <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be used to protect her anchorage. "Pobeda"s <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> consisted of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a> and was thick. The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 9 inches and her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ranged from in thickness.

"Pobeda" (Victory) was ordered on 26 April 1898 from the <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Works</a> and construction began on 30 May 1898 at the company's <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> shipyard, well before the formal <a href="keel%20laying">keel-laying</a> ceremony on 21 February 1899. The ship was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 10 May 1900 and towed to <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> on 31 August 1901 for <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>. She made her machinery trials in October, well before she was completed the next year. She sailed to <a href="Reval">Reval</a> (modern Tallinn) on 1 August to participate in the naval review held there a few days later to commemorate the visit of the German <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a>, to Russia. "Pobeda" entered service upon completing her artillery trials on October 1902, although she was not officially accepted until 10 March 1903, at a cost of 10,050,000 <a href="rubles">rubles</a>. She had already sailed from <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a> on 13 November 1902 and arrived at Port Arthur on 13 June 1903 for assignment to the Pacific Squadron.

After the Japanese victory in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–95, tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and Korea. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903, as it had promised. Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began <a href="wikt%3Amoor">mooring</a> in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, so as to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">surprise attack</a> on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. "Pobeda" was not hit in the initial torpedo-boat attack, and <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d the following morning when the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, commanded by <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, attacked. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. "Pobeda" was hit once or twice <a href="amidships">amidships</a> near the waterline, losing two men killed and four wounded, but the shell(s) failed to penetrate the ship's armor and little damage was done.

On 22 March, "Pobeda" joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor and hit the once, killing seven men. She participated in the action of 13 April, when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral <a href="Stepan%20Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a>'s <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur, and "Petropavlovsk" struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. When "Pobeda" was returning to port after "Petropavlovsk" sank, she struck a mine herself, but was able to steam to the harbor under her own power despite an 11° <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a>. Her repairs were completed on 9 June although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce the defenses of the port. "Pobeda" lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, one 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns. She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>. The new fleet commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a>, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle. "Pobeda" bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July.

The Japanese bombardment of 9 August, coupled with a direct order from <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>, forced Vitgeft to make another attempt to reach Vladivostok. The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok the next morning. At 12:25, it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. "Pobeda" was third in line during the battle, and was not seriously damaged during the early long-range stage of the action. Around 18:00, two 12-inch shells from the battleship penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian <a href="battleline">battleline</a> started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind "Tsesarevich", including "Pobeda", to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship.

As the Japanese ships continued to pound the "Tsesarevich", the battleship boldly charged Tōgō's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire, followed shortly afterward by "Peresvet", the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Prince <a href="Pavel%20Ukhtomsky">Pavel Ukhtomsky</a>. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> railings because "Peresvet"s topmasts had been shot away; the signal was only gradually recognized. Although "Pobeda" was struck by eleven large-caliber hits that killed 4 men and wounded 29, including one below the waterline, they failed to penetrate her armor and she reached Port Arthur without any difficulties; the hits did knock out one 10-inch gun and three 75-millimeter guns.

Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the <a href="Japanese%20Third%20Army">Japanese Third Army</a> led by <a href="Baron">Baron</a> <a href="Nogi%20Maresuke">Nogi Maresuke</a>. The new commander, Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20Viren">Robert N. Viren</a>, decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. This proved to make little difference and "Pobeda" was struck by several and 4.7-inch shells on 28 September that did no significant damage. The Japanese bombardment with medium guns continued for the next month and a half and the ship was repeatedly struck, without much effect. Japanese troops were able to seize <a href="203%20Hill">203 Hill</a> which overlooked the harbor on 5 December. This allowed the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships; they hit "Pobeda" approximately 30 times and sank her in shallow water on 7 December 1904. Russian attempts to destroy the ship before they surrendered were frustrated because her vital parts were already underwater.

"Pobeda" was refloated by Japanese engineers on 17 October 1905 and was classified as a first-class battleship by the IJN. She was renamed as "Suwo" on 25 October, after the <a href="Suo%20Province">ancient province</a>. She steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 16 December and began temporary repairs. Her reconstruction at <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> began in May 1906 and lasted until 10 October 1908.

To improve her stability, "Suwo"s forward <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting top</a> was removed. "Suwo" was rearmed with four 10-inch 45 caliber guns, ten <a href="QF%206%20inch%20/40%20naval%20gun%23Japanese%20naval%20service">6-inch</a> guns and sixteen <a href="QF%2012%20pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun">QF 12-pounder 12 cwt ()</a> guns. Two above-water <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch (450 mm)</a> torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men.

"Suwo" was re-designated as a first-class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 and became a training ship for cadets and engineers. Initially assigned to the 1st Standing Squadron when World War I began, she shortly afterwards became the flagship of the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="Kato%20Sadakichi">Kato Sadakichi</a>. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of <a href="Tsingtao">Tsingtao</a>, China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. "Tango" and the other ships of the squadron, reinforced by the British pre-dreadnought , bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November. "Suwo" served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915–1916 before becoming a gunnery training ship at Yokosuka for the rest of the war. In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, "Suwo" was disarmed at the <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a>. While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July. She was probably scrapped in 1922–1923, but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946.

The Halo Graphic Novel

The Halo Graphic Novel is the first <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> adaptation of the <a href="military%20science%20fiction">military science fiction</a> video game "<a href="Halo%20%28series%29">Halo</a>", published by <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> in partnership with <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a>. The <a href="Halo%20%28series%29">"Halo" series</a> began with the award-winning popular video game "", which spawned several books as well as video game sequels, and is focused on the story of future humanity fighting against a powerful collective of races called the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>. "The Halo Graphic Novel" is the series' first entry into the <a href="sequential%20art">sequential art</a> medium, and features aspects of the <a href="Halo%20%28series%29">"Halo" universe</a> which until then had not been discussed or seen in any medium.

The majority of the book is divided into four <a href="short%20stories">short stories</a> by different writers and artists from the computer game and comic industries. Each story focuses on different aspects of the "Halo" universe, revealing stories that are tangential to the main plot of the game. Apart from the stories, the book also contains an extensive art gallery compiled of contributions from Bungie, Marvel and independent sources.

Released on July 19, 2006, "The Halo Graphic Novel" was well-received, with reviewers noting the cohesiveness of the work as a whole, as well as the diversity of the individual material. The success of the novel led to Marvel announcing a new limited comic series, which became known as "".

Bungie's and Microsoft's original concept of the graphic novel was to bring the "Halo" series into new media beyond that of video games, with sequential art being the main focus. The comic was originally pitched by the head of Microsoft's Franchise Development Eric Trautmann, who led the assembly of a draft comic written by <a href="John%20Ney%20Rieber">John Ney Rieber</a> and illustrated by <a href="Adi%20Granov">Adi Granov</a>. However, Lorraine McLees, the art director of Bungie, disliked the comic, calling it "a lump of coal". Bungie also disliked Trautmann's comic team and requested to be able to choose their own artists and writers instead. Pete Parsons, the studio director of Bungie, wanted to hire <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="Joe%20Kubert">Joe Kubert</a> for the graphic novel, though Trautmann was highly skeptical that such high-profile artists would deign to the project.

After many unsuccessful negotiation attempts, Lorraine suggested that Bungie finance and edit the novel itself before pursuing a publisher, allowing the studio to maintain control over the content and pursue the venture unencumbered by outside intervention. Lead designer Maria Cabardo created a "dream team" roster of writers and artists Bungie admired, and through a period of negotiation Bungie was able to gain contributions from many of those named on the list. Buoyed by their success in approaching those in the medium that they respected and admired, including British <a href="comic%20book%20artist">comic book artist</a> <a href="Simon%20Bisley">Simon Bisley</a> and French artist <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean "Moebius" Giraud</a>, the progress of "Halo Graphic Novel" was described as a "cool morale boost for our team to see their universe, their characters, realized by people that we idolize in the comic industry."

The novel was completed after a two-year development cycle and Bungie sought out a publisher, eventually approaching <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a>. Bungie cited Marvel's "passion for "Halo"" and "reach in the comic and publishing industry" as the main draws to the company. The studio worked alongside Marvel director of development Ruwan Jayatilleke, an early champion of the project, to assist in the distribution and publication of the novel.

The stories themselves were designed as glimpses into the "Halo" universe, including information on the inner workings of the alien <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>, as well as details regarding elements of the back-story that were hitherto undisclosed. Jarrard explained that "The stories that happen off camera, the parallel events to the arcs that our fans know from the existing mediums, are the stories we really wanted to tell." Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the <a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a>, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond "... a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." The four stories that ended up in the final publication were "the most interesting to [Bungie], and the writers of [the novel]". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the "Halo Graphic Novel", the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that "the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game. Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action" based on what was given to the artists and writers.

Located after the main body of stories is a selection of art pieces that represent interpretations of the "Halo" universe from a number of comic book artists. These contributors include Doug Alexander, <a href="Rick%20Berry%20%28artist%29">Rick Berry</a>, <a href="Geof%20Darrow">Geof Darrow</a>, and more than twenty-five others, both freelance and from <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a>—including lead composer <a href="Martin%20O%27Donnell">Martin O'Donnell</a>.

A few promotional pieces were created before the "Halo Graphic Novel"'s release date, including a sixteen-page preview, released May 31, 2006, which contained Bungie's introductions to each story along with short excerpts of each story. A full-color poster of the book's cover was released on June 28, 2006.

The novel is split into four stories; each has an introduction by the creators of the work detailing their thoughts about the plot or their experiences adding to the "Halo" lore.

"The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor" takes place during and after the sixth mission of the video game "". During the game, players discover that the <a href="ringworld">ringworld</a> on which they are trapped, dubbed "<a href="Halo%20%28megastructure%29">Halo</a>" by the enemy alien collective the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>, is in fact a super weapon designed to wipe out all life in the galaxy to deprive an intergalactic parasite known as the Flood of their food source (their food source being all sentient life in the galaxy). The Flood are accidentally released by the Covenant from <a href="stasis%20%28fiction%29">stasis</a> and begins to spread across the ring. Halo was built by an ancient alien race known as the <a href="Forerunners%20%28Halo%29">Forerunners</a> to contain and study the Flood, but also as a weapon of last resort; faced with the prospect of the Flood consuming every thinking being in the universe, the Forerunners activated Halo, destroying themselves but also starving the Flood.

In contrast to the player's point of view in the game, "The Last Voyage" focuses on the Covenant. In "Halo: Combat Evolved"s sequel "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>", players experience some of the plot through the eyes of the <a href="Arbiter%20%28Halo%29">Arbiter</a>, a Covenant warrior. The Arbiter is aided by a fellow Covenant Elite who is never named in the game itself; fans called the character "Half-Jaw" due to the Elite missing his mandibles on one side of his face. "The Last Voyage" names the Elite <a href="Covenant%20Spec-Ops%20Commander">Rtas 'Vadumee</a>, explains his injury, and describes events during "Halo" that the player did not see.

In "The Last Voyage", Elite Special Operations Commander Rtas 'Vadumee and his team respond to a distress call and board the crippled supply craft "Infinite Succor", which the Covenant believe has been attacked by humans. The only crew member still alive, a Covenant Prophet, tells 'Vadumee that the "Succor" has been infested by the Flood, which escaped Halo on a Covenant dropship and crash landed in the "Succor"s hangar. Currently stuck on the ship, the parasite intends to activate the "Succor"s <a href="slipspace">slipspace</a> drive to escape the star system and find new planets to infect. Fighting waves of Flood, including the reanimated remains of his fallen soldiers, 'Vadumee plots a <a href="slipspace">slipspace</a> course that will destroy both the "Succor" and the Flood, then escapes via a Covenant shuttle.

The central premise behind the story of "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor" was to showcase both the true danger posed by the Flood and the inner workings of the Covenant military machine, to dispel the image that the Covenant "simply stand around waiting for the Chief to blast them". The story was written by <a href="Lee%20Hammock">Lee Hammock</a> with art provided by Simon Bisley. Hammock described the process of writing the story as a "heady task" since he had to respect "Halo" fans' knowledge of the characters and canon, ensuring that "characters that [the fans] know as a part of themselves are portrayed aptly". These difficulties were mitigated by the knowledge that fans were not as intimately connected to the history of the character of Rtas as they were to the likes of the Master Chief; this allowed ample room to expand 'Vadumee's background in sync with the "Halo" canon while permitting the writer to "bring something new to the table".

In the "Halo" universe, Earth and humanity's various colonies are governed by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Space%20Command">United Nations Space Command</a>. Faced with the technological superiority of the Covenant, humanity's chief hope is the tenacity of the <a href="SPARTAN">SPARTAN</a>s, elite <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a>s equipped with special armor. The protagonist of the "Halo" series, the <a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a>, is one of the few SPARTANs in active service by the events of "Halo: Combat Evolved". "Armor Testing" takes place shortly before the opening of "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>", as the UNSC field-tests a new version of the SPARTAN's armor in a series of exercises which prove to be a challenging endeavor for all involved. A lone SPARTAN puts the armor through its paces by dropping from Earth's atmosphere and engaging in a mock battle against <a href="United%20Nations%20Space%20Command%23Orbital%20Drop%20Shock%20Troopers">UNSC special forces</a>. This SPARTAN is revealed to be a woman, Maria-062, who has come out of retirement as a special favor to test the new equipment before it is sent to the Master Chief.

The concept of the story was inspired by the book "Skunkworks", a memoir of the <a href="Skunk%20Works">testing of military projects</a> at <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>; highlighting the rigorous experimentation the SPARTAN equipment goes through before it ends up in the hands of the Master Chief was an idea that Bungie originally wanted to pursue at the beginning of "Halo 2". Bungie instead opted to communicate this background information at a later time. "Armor Testing" was written by <a href="Jay%20Faerber">Jay Faerber</a> with pencils by <a href="W.%20Andrew%20Robinson">W. Andrew Robinson</a> and colors by Ed Lee.

Like "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor", "Breaking Quarantine" deals with the <a href="Flood%20%28Halo%29">Flood</a> outbreak that occurs during "Halo". While "The Last Voyage" tells the story from the Covenant perspective, "Breaking Quarantine" highlights the escape of the human soldier <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Avery%20Johnson">Sgt. Johnson</a> from the Flood. Johnson is a minor personality in "Halo: Combat Evolved" who becomes an important character in the following two games; while the novel "" explains that Johnson resists Flood infestation due to a medical condition, no other story up to that point explained how Johnson escapes. "Breaking Quarantine" is an example of Bungie's attempts to expand the story arcs of secondary characters that would have no opportunity to go explained in the main storyline. Unlike the other stories, "Breaking Quarantine" contains no dialogue, only weapon sound effects, which are rendered in Japanese. Both art and story were provided by <a href="Tsutomu%20Nihei">Tsutomu Nihei</a>, a <a href="Mangaka">manga artist</a> and architect who based his illustrations directly on the structures found within the game.

Near the beginning of "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>", the Covenant stumble upon humanity's best-guarded secret—the location of Earth—and launch a direct attack on the city of New <a href="Mombasa%2C%20Kenya">Mombasa, Kenya</a>. By the time players arrive at the city in "Halo 2", it is deserted; "Second Sunrise", which takes place during the attack, explains that this was not always the case. The story is told through the eyes of a reporter who creates propaganda for the UNSC. When the Covenant invade the city, the reporter and fellow citizens take to its defense, until they are forced to flee as the city faces ruin.

Bungie described "Second Sunrise" as an attempt to put a human face on the conflict by illustrating the effects of war on the common citizen. The story was written by <a href="Brett%20Lewis">Brett Lewis</a> with art provided by <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean "Moebius" Giraud</a>. Giraud explained that his son's enjoyment of the game series ultimately compelled him to accept an invitation to contribute his art; before penciling, he had never played the video games.

Critical reaction from both the gaming community and the comic book community was positive. <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO Networks</a> praised the novel, citing the wealth of contributions from recognized artists and the strength of the material in fleshing out the "Halo" universe as the work's greatest strength. They gave it an overall grade of B+. Mike Deeley of <a href="Comics%20Bulletin">Comics Bulletin</a> lauded the book for the diverse range of storytelling and art styles that lent the "Halo Graphic Novel" the feel of an anthology yet still retained a cohesive whole. Other areas that received particular attention included Tsutomu Nihei's work on "Breaking Quarantine" for its vivid imagery and its focus on visual storytelling in lieu of any dialogue.

Some reviewers expressed their disappointment at the novel's focus on minor characters and events, with the presence of the Master Chief—the central character of the "Halo" series and its most iconic figure—limited to featuring in artwork and a brief appearance in the first story. On the other hand, <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> praised Bungie for having the moxie to not focus on the major character. Each publication had their own opinions on the weakest story in the collection; both <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and GameTrailers thought that "Armor Testing" had the least emotional impact, although its surprise ending and art were well done.

Upon release, the "Halo Graphic Novel" proved to be a "rare hit" for the games-to-comics genre, debuting at No. 2 on both the <a href="Nielsen%20BookScan">Nielsen BookScan</a> and <a href="Diamond%20Comic%20Distributors">Diamond</a> sales charts. At least 100,000 copies were rumored to have been published, and the comic continued to be one of the top-selling graphic novels months after its debut. The success of the novel led Marvel Comics and Bungie to announce a four-issue monthly "Halo" comic series at San Diego <a href="Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con 2006</a> called "". Despite delays, the first issue of the limited series was released on August 22, 2007.

Gilbert Foliot

Gilbert Foliot (<a href="circa">c</a>. 1110 – 18 February 1187) was a medieval English monk and <a href="prelate">prelate</a>, successively <a href="Abbot%20of%20Gloucester">Abbot of Gloucester</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk at <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluny Abbey</a> in France at about the age of twenty. After holding two posts as <a href="prior">prior</a> in the Cluniac order he was appointed <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> of <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester Abbey</a> in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman <a href="Miles%20of%20Gloucester%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Miles of Gloucester</a>. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped to fabricate some <a href="charter">charter</a>s—legal deeds attesting property ownership—to gain advantage in a dispute with the <a href="archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishops of York</a>. Although Foliot recognised <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen</a> as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>'s claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release.

Foliot accompanied <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald of Bec</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, to a <a href="Council%20of%20Reims%20%281148%29">papal council</a> at <a href="Reims">Reims</a> in 1148. During his time there he was appointed to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a> by Pope <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Eugene III</a>. Despite a promise made in Reims not to recognise Stephen, Foliot on his return to England nevertheless swore fealty to the king, causing a temporary rift in his relationship with Henry of Anjou, Matilda's son, who eventually became King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> of England in 1154. When Theobald died in 1160, it was widely assumed that he would be replaced by Foliot, but King Henry nominated his <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, instead. Foliot later claimed to have opposed this appointment, and supported Henry during the king's dispute with the new archbishop. Foliot was <a href="Translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translated</a>, or moved, to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20London">Diocese of London</a> in 1163, perhaps as consolation for not receiving Canterbury.

During the <a href="Becket%20controversy">great dispute between Becket and the king</a>, Foliot was reviled by Becket and his supporters. He acted as an envoy for the king on a number of diplomatic missions related to this dispute and wrote a number of letters against Becket which were circulated widely in Europe. Becket <a href="excommunicated">excommunicated</a> Foliot on two occasions, the second of which precipitated the archbishop's martyrdom. For a short period following Becket's death the papacy kept Foliot excommunicate, but he was quickly absolved and allowed to resume his <a href="Bishop">episcopal functions</a>. In addition to his role in the Becket controversy, Foliot often served as a royal judge, and was an active administrator and bishop in his different dioceses. He was a prolific letter writer, and some of his correspondence was collected after his death. He also wrote sermons and biblical commentaries, two of which are extant.

Foliot was probably the son of Robert Foliot—steward to <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Earl of Huntingdon</a>, heir to the Scottish throne—and Robert's wife Agnes, sister of <a href="Robert%20de%20Chesney">Robert de Chesney</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. Whatever his parentage, Gilbert was certainly Robert de Chesney's nephew; another of his uncles, Reginald, was a monk of Gloucester Abbey and <a href="Abbot%20of%20Evesham">Abbot</a> of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a>. Other ecclesiastics in his family included <a href="Robert%20Foliot">Robert Foliot</a>, a later Bishop of Hereford perhaps from an Oxford branch of the family, and two earlier Bishops of London, <a href="Richard%20de%20Beaumis%20%28died%201127%29">Richard de Beaumis the elder</a> and <a href="Richard%20de%20Beaumis%20%28died%201162%29">Richard de Beaumis the younger</a>, Gilbert also referred to <a href="Richard%20of%20Ilchester">Richard of Ilchester</a>, later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, as a kinsman, but the exact relationship is unknown. <a href="William%20de%20Chesney">William de Chesney</a>, a partisan of Stephen's and a leading Oxfordshire layman, was another of Foliot's uncles, and Miles of Gloucester, <a href="Earl%20of%20Hereford">Earl of Hereford</a>, was a cousin. In about 1145 Foliot intervened to secure the release of a knight to whom he was related, Roger Foliot, but their precise relationship is unknown.

Born about 1110, Foliot became a monk of Cluny, probably in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of <a href="Abbeville">Abbeville</a>, a Cluniac house. There are some indications that he studied law at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, and he may have studied under <a href="Robert%20Pullen">Robert Pullen</a>, the English theologian, either at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. He also acquired a knowledge of <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> as well as the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a>. The names of two of his early teachers are known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned <a href="biblical%20exegesis">biblical exegesis</a>, probably from Pullen.

Foliot attended the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Second Lateran Council</a>, called by Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a>. It opened on 4 April 1139, and among other matters heard an appeal from the Empress Matilda concerning her claim to the throne of England. Matilda was the daughter and only surviving legitimate child of King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, had seized the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.

In about 1143 Foliot wrote an account of the proceedings of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo. According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Scotland">Edith-Matilda</a>, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a> had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Angevin</a> cause, as Matilda's claim was known.

In 1139 Foliot was elected Abbot of Gloucester, blessed by the diocesan bishop on 11 June 1139. The appointment had been pushed through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was by then the Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable father had been steward to <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a>, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.

King Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces on 2 February 1141, and Matilda called a council at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> to gather support for her assuming the throne. Foliot attended the council and was one of her main supporters in the following months as the Angevin cause tried to place her on the throne.

It was during his time as abbot that Foliot wrote his reply to <a href="Brien%20FitzCount">Brien FitzCount</a>, one of Matilda's earliest supporters, discussing the Second Council of the Lateran's deliberations on Matilda's cause. FitzCount, in a letter now lost, had presented his reasons for supporting Matilda, and Foliot's reply set forth a defence of Matilda's claim to the throne. Foliot also wrote that Stephen had "dishonoured the episcopate" with his behaviour in 1139, when the king arrested <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and Roger's nephew, <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander</a>, who was Bishop of Lincoln, as well as attempting to arrest another of Roger's nephews, <a href="Nigel%20%28bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel, Bishop of Ely</a>. After the arrest Stephen forced the bishops to surrender their castles and secular government offices. Most historians see Foliot's letter as firmly supporting Matilda's cause, although one of King Stephen's recent biographers, Donald Matthew, claims that Foliot's support was lukewarm at best, motivated by the location of his abbey in one of Matilda's strongholds. Matthew points out that Gloucester Abbey owed no military service in a <a href="Feudalism">feudal levy</a>, which allowed Foliot to avoid choosing sides irrevocably. Matthew also points out that after 1141 Foliot is a signatory to just one of Matilda's charters. Foliot did though address <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert of Gloucester</a>'s defence of Matilda's rights, buttressing it with arguments of his own. Robert had argued that the Bible supported female succession, and quoted from Numbers, chapter 36, which allowed women to inherit, but prohibited them marrying outside their tribe. In his reply Foliot claimed that Robert had actually used Numbers, chapter 27, which had no restrictions on the marriage of heiresses.

During his time as abbot Foliot became friendly with <a href="Aelred%20of%20Rievaulx">Aelred of Rievaulx</a>, a writer and later saint, who dedicated a book of sermons to him. Another friend and ally from his abbacy was Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who during Stephen's reign was attempting to unite the English Church under his leadership. Foliot helped Theobald by forming a communication link to Matilda's side.

Foliot took an interest in the Dorset monastery of <a href="Cerne%20Abbey">Cerne Abbey</a>, which in 1145 received the Prior of Gloucester Abbey, Bernard, as abbot. Bernard was an active reformer, and Foliot supported Bernard's efforts, but the monks objected to the new abbot, and drove him out of the monastery. Both abbot and monks appealed to the papacy, which supported the abbot. Although Matilda wrote to Foliot, and interceded on behalf of the monks, Foliot pointed out that he was unable to disobey a papal command.

While abbot, Foliot supervised the acquisition of a <a href="Priory">dependent priory</a> in the city of <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a> for the monastery. Most of the abbey buildings predate Foliot's time as abbot, and there is no sure evidence of any buildings he added to the monastery. During his abbacy, a dispute that had dragged on between Gloucester and the Archdiocese of York over some manors was finally settled in Gloucester's favour. This was done with a group of forged charters that Foliot may have helped to create. Forging charters was a common practice in English monasteries of the time. Foliot also had disputes with the Welsh bishop Uhtred, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Llandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</a>, over <a href="Goldcliff%20Priory">Goldcliff Priory</a> and a church in <a href="Llancarfan">Llancarfan</a>, concerning tithes and new chapels that had been built without Gloucester Abbey's permission.

In early 1148, Foliot accompanied Theobald of Bec to the <a href="Council%20of%20Reims">Council of Reims</a>, even though the archbishop had been forbidden to attend by King Stephen; Foliot was presumably with Theobald when the archbishop used a small fishing boat in his escape from England to the continent. <a href="Robert%20de%20Bethune">Robert de Bethune</a>, the Bishop of Hereford, died at the Council of Reims, and Foliot was nominated by Pope Eugene III to fill the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a>, which was held by the Angevin cause. Theobald was behind the appointment, having urged it on the pope. It appears likely that before his consecration Foliot gave assurances that he would not swear fealty to Stephen. He was consecrated Bishop of Hereford on 5 September 1148 at <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a> by Archbishop Theobald. The other English bishops present at Reims—<a href="Hilary%20of%20Chichester">Hilary of Chichester</a> and <a href="Josceline%20de%20Bohon">Josceline de Bohon</a>—refused to help with the consecration, claiming it was contrary to custom for an English bishop to be consecrated outside England. Another of the bishops' concerns was that the pope had infringed Stephen's right to a say in the election. After his consecration Foliot swore fealty to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry of Anjou</a>, the son of the Empress and the new head of the Angevin party.

Foliot switched his allegiance on his return to England and swore fealty to Stephen, angering the Angevins. Theobald managed to secure peace between the parties, saying that Foliot could not refuse to swear homage "to the prince approved by the papacy". Foliot also attempted to hold Hereford in <a href="Benefice%23Abuse">plurality</a>, or at the same time, with the abbey of Gloucester, but the monks of Gloucester objected. Rather than accept a situation like that of <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, who held the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Diocese of Winchester</a> as well as being <a href="Abbot%20of%20Glastonbury">Abbot of Glastonbury</a>, the monks of Gloucester held an election three weeks after Foliot's selection as bishop, and chose their prior as the new abbot.

Foliot supported his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, and maintaining a long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than would be expected of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included <a href="Roger%20de%20Pont%20L%27%C3%89v%C3%AAque">Roger de Pont L'Évêque</a>, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and <a href="William%20de%20Turbeville">William de Turbeville</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.

During the later part of Stephen's reign Foliot was active in judicial affairs, including a case in 1150 involving <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> and his kinsman <a href="Roger%20Fitzmiles%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Roger</a>, the Earl of Hereford, which ended up in the court of Archbishop Theobald. Foliot's participation in legal affairs led him in 1153 to employ a clerk specialising in <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a>.

After Henry of Anjou's accession to the throne of England as <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> in 1154, Foliot persuaded the Earl of Hereford to submit to the new king's demand that he return the custody of certain royal castles to the king. In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a>, whom the king had just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, <a href="Antipope%20Victor%20IV%20%281159%E2%80%931164%29">Victor IV</a>, intimating that the canonisation of King <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted as a reward for Henry's recognition of Alexander.

The art historian Hans J. Böker claims that Foliot began the construction of the Bishop's Chapel at <a href="Hereford%20Cathedral">Hereford Cathedral</a>. Böker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit <a href="Robert%20of%20Hereford">Robert of Hereford</a>, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.

When Theobald died in 1160, most observers believed that Foliot was the leading candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, at least since the replacement of <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a> by <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a> in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine Order</a> and thus the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a> and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.

Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He objected to the king's choice on the grounds that Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected archbishop was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have been that the king and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.

After Becket's election as archbishop, Foliot was nominated to the Diocese of London, to which he was translated on 6 March 1163. His nomination had been put forward by the king, who wrote to the pope stating that Foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor if he was in London, rather than in Hereford on the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>. Becket wrote to Foliot urging him to accept the translation. His transfer was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 19 March 1163 and Foliot was enthroned at London on 28 April 1163. Papal confirmation was required because the movement of bishops from one see to another was still frowned on at this time. The medieval chronicler <a href="Ralph%20de%20Diceto">Ralph de Diceto</a>, who was a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> at London, states that the cathedral chapter at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, London, the cathedral of the London diocese, approved of Foliot's selection. Becket was unable to attend Foliot's enthronement, and Foliot did not make a profession of obedience to the archbishop, arguing that he had already sworn an oath to Canterbury when he became Bishop of Hereford, and thus no further oath was required. The issue was sent to the papacy, but the pope refused to be pinned down to an answer. Foliot then attempted to make London independent of Canterbury by reviving Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory I</a>'s old plan for an archbishopric at London. Foliot proposed either to have London raised to an archdiocese along with Canterbury, or to have London replace Canterbury as the archiepiscopal seat for the southern province. Foliot did though support Becket in the latter's attempt to prevent the Archbishop of York having his archiepiscopal cross borne in procession before him when visiting the province of Canterbury.

By 1166, Foliot had been presented with a petition for annulment of the marriage of <a href="Aubrey%20de%20Vere%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Aubrey de Vere</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a>, and <a href="Agnes%20of%20Essex">Agnes of Essex</a>. On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9 May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope to affirm the validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for his handling of the case.

The king and Becket began quarrelling in July 1163, at first over financial matters and then over the marriage of Henry's younger brother to an heiress, which Becket forbade. The true spark to the quarrel was the matter of clergy who committed crimes, who the king wished to have prosecuted in secular courts; the archbishop refused, arguing that all clergy must be tried in church courts, even if the crime was non-ecclesiastical. At the <a href="Council%20of%20Westminster">Council of Westminster</a> called by Henry in October 1163 to deal with the issue, Foliot at first sided with the other bishops, who supported Becket's position and opposed the king. However, after the council was dismissed, Foliot became the leader of those bishops who changed sides in support of the king. In December, Becket capitulated to the king.

In January 1164 the king summoned a council at <a href="Clarendon%20Palace">Clarendon</a>. The bishops were asked to approve the <a href="Constitutions%20of%20Clarendon">Constitutions of Clarendon</a>, which proposed restrictions on the powers of the Church and limits to papal authority in England; Becket's refusal led to the great dispute between king and archbishop, into which Foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn. When Becket appeared before the court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him, a studied insult to the king, Foliot told the archbishop that "If the king were to brandish his sword, as you now brandish yours, what hope can there be of peace between you?" The king refused to see Becket, and negotiations between the two camps soon revealed that Becket had ordered the bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did. Becket also threatened to appeal the case to the papacy. Both of these actions by the archbishop breached the Constitutions of Clarendon. During the subsequent back and forth between the bishops and the king, as well as the bishops and the archbishop, Foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade Becket to modify his behaviour. Foliot replied that Becket "was always a fool and always will be".

After the bishops refused to pass judgment, the barons attempted to do so, but Becket refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission. Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to Becket and suggested a compromise, which Becket refused. Becket went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> on 2 November 1164. Foliot was sent, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hilary of Chichester, <a href="Bartholomew%20Iscanus">Bartholomew Iscanus</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Exeter">Bishop of Exeter</a>, <a href="Roger%20of%20Worcester">Roger of Worcester</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, <a href="William%20d%27Aubigny%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">William d'Aubigny</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a>, and a group of royal clerks, to <a href="Thierry%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Thierry</a> the <a href="Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>, <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII</a> the <a href="List%20of%20French%20monarchs">King of France</a>, and Pope Alexander III. Their mission was to prevent the archbishop from being given refuge, but despite their efforts Louis of France agreed to grant Becket refuge. Foliot's delegation met with more success at the <a href="Roman%20Curia">papal court</a>; although they did not succeed in securing a decision in the king's favour, neither did the pope side with the archbishop.

During Becket's exile Foliot collected and sent to Rome <a href="Peter%27s%20Pence">Peter's Pence</a>, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict that it was not a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Canterbury">diocese of Canterbury</a>. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.

In early summer 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, ordering him to intercede with the king and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but would still have to answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of <a href="simony">simony</a>, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although there is no evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.

On 10 June 1166, Becket excommunicated a number of his opponents, some specifically by name, as well as any who opposed his cause. Henry's response was to order the English bishops to appeal to the pope, which they did at a council that Foliot organised and led in London on 24 June. The appeal was written by Foliot, and a separate letter from the bishops, also written by Foliot, was sent to the archbishop. The bishops rested their case on the fact that those excommunicated had not been warned or allowed to defend themselves. They pointed out to the pope that the king had not escalated the conflict and had behaved reasonably to the last papal overtures in the summer of 1165. Becket replied to these moves with a letter written to Foliot that was full of resentment and reproaches. Foliot's reply, in a letter that is usually titled "Multiplicem nobis", set forth his view of Becket's abilities as archbishop as well as giving reasons why Becket was wrong. He then suggested that the archbishop compromise and exercise some humility in order to reach his goals. By the end of 1166, Foliot managed to resign his custody of the confiscated Canterbury benefices, something he had been attempting to do for some time, thus removing one source of conflict between him and Becket.

In November 1167 Foliot was summoned to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some discussion and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket as well as the bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise on the subject of the Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18 November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.

On 13 April 1169, Becket excommunicated Foliot, along with <a href="Hugh%20Bigod%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Hugh, Earl of Norfolk</a>, Josceline de Bohun, and seven royal officials. Becket did this even though none of them had been warned, and despite the fact that the pope had asked that Becket not make any such sentences until after a pending embassy to King Henry had ended. Becket also warned a number of others that unless they made amends to him, they too would be excommunicated on 29 May, <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">Ascension Day</a>. In his excommunication, Becket called Foliot "that wolf in sheep's clothing". Although Foliot tried to enlist the help of his fellow bishops in an appeal, they were less than helpful. Foliot then prepared to appeal his sentence to the pope in person, and travelled to Normandy in late June or early July, where he met the king, but proceeded no further towards Rome, as the papacy was attempting once more to secure a negotiated settlement. In late August and early September serious but ultimately fruitless negotiations took place between the king and the archbishop.

Foliot then proceeded to Rome, but at Milan he received word that his envoy at the papal court had secured the right for him to be absolved by <a href="Rotrou%20%28archbishop%20of%20Rouen%29">Rotrou, Archbishop of Rouen</a>. Foliot then returned to <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, where he was absolved on 5 April and reinstated in his see on 1 May. The only requirement of this absolution was that Foliot accept a penance to be imposed by the pope. Much of Foliot's objections to Becket's excommunication stemmed from the lack of warning that Foliot and the others had received, contrary to the customary and normal procedures. Becket and his supporters pointed out that there were some situations in which it was possible to excommunicate without warning, but Foliot claimed that the present situation was not one of them. According to Foliot, Becket's habit was "to condemn first, judge second". Foliot's example of appealing excommunications to the papacy was an important step in the setting up of an appeal process for excommunication during the 12th century.

On 14 June 1170, Henry's son, <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry the Young King</a>, was crowned King of England by the Archbishop of York, which infringed on the right of Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury to crown English monarchs. Although there is no definitive evidence that Foliot assisted in the coronation, it appears likely that he did so. The coronation drove the pope to allow Becket to lay an <a href="interdict">interdict</a>, or decree prohibiting church rites, on England as punishment, and the threat of an interdict forced Henry to negotiate with Becket in July 1170. Becket and the king came to terms on 22 July 1170, allowing the archbishop to return to England, which he did in early December. However, shortly before he landed in England, he excommunicated Roger of York, Josceline of Salisbury, and Foliot. One possible reason for the excommunications was that the three ecclesiastics had electors from the various vacant bishoprics with them, and were escorting those electors to the king on the continent in order to reward a number of royal clerks with the long vacant bishoprics. Included among those royal clerks were some of Becket's most bitter foes during his exile. Although Becket offered to absolve Josceline and Foliot, he argued that only the pope could absolve Roger, as he was an archbishop. Roger persuaded the other two to appeal to the king, then in Normandy. When they did so, the royal anger at the timing of the excommunications was such that it led to Henry uttering the question often attributed to him "Will no one rid me of the turbulent priest". This inspired four knights to set off from the king's court in Normandy to Canterbury, where on 29 December 1170, they murdered Becket.

After Becket's death his sentences of excommunication were confirmed, as well as the suspensions from ecclesiastical office. The pope in his confirmation referred to Roger of York, Foliot, and Josceline of Salisbury, as the "Gilbertine trinity". The excommunication was absolved for Foliot on 1 August 1171, but he remained suspended from office. He secured his restoration to office on 1 May 1172, after clearing himself of any involvement in Becket's murder. The king performed a public act of penance on 12 July 1174 at Canterbury, when he publicly confessed his sins, and then allowed each bishop present, including Foliot, to give him five blows from a rod, then each of the 80 monks of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> gave the king three blows. The king then offered gifts to Becket's shrine and spent a vigil at Becket's tomb.

Foliot and Becket seem to have been on amicable terms until 1163, but their relationship seems to have soured after that date. Becket accused Foliot in 1167 with: "your aim has all along been to effect the downfall of the Church and ourself". After the pope absolved Foliot's excommunication in early 1170, Becket exclaimed to a cardinal that "Satan is unloosed for the destruction of the Church". A modern biographer of Becket, the historian <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a>, feels that one reason for Becket's change in behaviour after his election as archbishop was due to his need to "out-bishop" the other bishops, and prevent Foliot from making any more jibes about his inadequacies as an ecclesiastic.

Foliot was mainly a force for moderation in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of "ad cautelam", which was an appeal to the papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of "ad cautelam" was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.

During his time as bishop Foliot served for many years as a <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">papal judge-delegate</a>, especially in his later years. He was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters and other religious houses of the dioceses. He kept in constant contact with his <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a>s and <a href="Dean%20%28Christianity%29">deans</a> about the administration of the dioceses. He also gathered about himself a group of clerks who compiled a collection of <a href="decretal">decretal</a>s known as the Belvoir collection. This collection mainly relates to Foliot's activities at London, and probably dates to before 1175.

Foliot was well known as a letter writer, and his letters were later collected as a book. The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>, is supposed to have originated in Foliot's own writing office. About 250 to 300 examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500 items. The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and <a href="Christopher%20N.%20L.%20Brooke">Christopher N. L. Brooke</a> and published by the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a> in 1967, under the title of "The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot". Some of the letters have appeared in volumes five through eight of "Materials for the History of Thomas Becket", from the <a href="Rolls%20Series">Rolls Series</a>, published from 1875–1885. Older editions appeared in the "<a href="Patres%20ecclesiae%20Anglicanae">Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae</a>" series from the 1840s, and in Migne's "Patrologica" from 1854. The letters cover most of the period of Foliot's public life, and are one of the main sources for the history of that period. The historian <a href="David%20Knowles%20%28scholar%29">David Knowles</a> said of the collection that "owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [it] is of the greatest value for the church historian". According to Knowles, Foliot's letters paint a picture of an active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian church reforms</a> but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church. His letters are typical of the educated letter writer of his time, refined and polished to an art form.

Foliot also wrote a number of sermons and commentaries on the Bible. Of the commentaries, only those on the "<a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>" and the "<a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>" still survive. The commentary on the "Song of Songs" was first printed in 1638, by <a href="Patrick%20Young">Patrick Young</a>, and again in the "<a href="Patrologia%20Latina">Patrologia Latina</a>" volume 202. The commentary on the Lord's Prayer was first published by David Bell in 1989. The commentary on the "Song of Songs" has been printed three times, the last in the middle of the 20th century. About 60 of his "acta", or decisions, as Bishop of Hereford still survive, and from his time at London a further 150 or so are extant. A contemporary, Peter, the prior of <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Priory%2C%20Aldgate">Holy Trinity Priory</a> in <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a>, London, heard Foliot preach a sermon at a synod, and praised the sermon as "adorned with flowers of words and sentences and supported by a copious array of authorities. It ran backwards and forwards on its path from its starting-point back to the same starting point." The sermon so inspired Peter that he wrote a work entitled "Pantheologus", which dealt with the "distinctio" method of <a href="exegesis">exegesis</a>, which was developing around this time. All of Foliot's surviving theological works are based on exegesis, and may include nine sermons on the subject of Saints <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul">Paul</a>, which were dedicated to Aelred of Rivaulx. These sermons are dedicated to a "Gilbert, Bishop of London", which could mean either Foliot or an earlier bishop, <a href="Gilbert%20Universalis">Gilbert Universalis</a>. However, the historian <a href="Richard%20Sharpe%20%28historian%29">Richard Sharpe</a> feels that the fact that the sermons are paired with a group of Aelred's sermons dedicated to Foliot makes their authorship by Foliot slightly more likely. These sermons survive in manuscript, now in the British Library as Royal 2 D.xxxii, but have not yet been printed. A further group of sermons which were dedicated to Haimo, the abbot of <a href="Bordesley%20Abbey">Bordesley</a>, did not survive, but is known from the surviving dedication letter.

The antiquarian <a href="John%20Bale">John Bale</a> in the 1550s listed six works of Foliot known to him, five of which were letters. The sixth work known to Bale was the commentary on the "Song of Songs", which survived in a single manuscript, now in the Bodleian Library. Young also recorded a "Lundinensis Ecclesiae" as being by Foliot. The scholar <a href="John%20Pitts%20%28Catholic%20scholar%29">John Pits</a> gave much the same list in 1619, adding one work, a "Vitas aliquot sanctorum Angliae, Librum unun", but this work never appears in a medieval book catalogue and has not survived under this name so it is unclear if Foliot wrote such a work. The antiquary <a href="Thomas%20Tanner%20%28bishop%29">Thomas Tanner</a>, writing in the early 18th century, listed Foliot as the author of the seven works given by Bale and Pits, adding an eighth, the "Tractatus Gilberti, episcopi London: Super Istud "Sunt diuae olivae"", citing <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a>, the 16th-century antiquary, as his source. This apparently is the collection of nine sermons on Saints Peter and Paul that has yet to be published and is still in manuscript at the Bodleian Library. Leland also listed another work by Foliot, the "Omeliae Gileberti, episcopi Herefordensis", which he stated was held at <a href="Forde%20Abbey">Forde Abbey</a>. This work, since lost, might have been the sermons mentioned above, or could have been a known collection of homilies, also lost. It is also possible that another Gilbert was the author. Lastly, Walter Map recorded that Foliot had begun work on a "the Old and the New Law" shortly before his death.

Foliot died on 18 February 1187. The medieval chronicler <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> praised him as "a man most accomplished in the three languages, Latin, French and English, and eloquent and clear in each of them". The modern historian Frank Barlow says of him that "It was probably because he was so self-righteous that it could be suggested that his behaviour was sometimes devious." He went blind some time during the 1180s, but continued to work on his biblical writings.

Foliot sent his nephew Richard Foliot and another clerk of his household to Bologna to study law in the 1160s, exemplifying the growing emphasis laid on Roman law among his countrymen. Another nephew was <a href="Ralph%20Foliot">Ralph Foliot</a>, <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Hereford">Archdeacon of Hereford</a> and a royal justice during the reign of Richard I. During his time at both dioceses, he did much to promote his relatives, and all of the archdeacons he appointed while at London were either nephews or other relatives. A member of his household at Hereford was the scholar <a href="Roger%20of%20Hereford">Roger of Hereford</a>, who dedicated his <a href="computus">computus</a>, or treatise on calculating dates, to Foliot. Another work, the "Ysagoge in Theologiam", was dedicated to him by a writer named Odo while Foliot was still a prior in France.

Easy Jet

Easy Jet (1967–1992) was an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> foaled, or born, in 1967, and was one of only two horses to have been a member of the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (or AQHA) <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> as well as being an offspring of members. Easy Jet won the 1969 <a href="All%20American%20Futurity">All American Futurity</a>, the highest race for Quarter Horse racehorses, and was named World Champion Quarter Race Horse in the same year. He earned the highest <a href="Speed%20index">speed rating</a> awarded at the time—AAAT. After winning 27 of his 38 races in two years of racing, he retired from the race track and became a breeding <a href="stallion">stallion</a>.

As a sire, he was the first All American Futurity winner to sire an All American Futurity winner, and went on to sire three winners of that race, and nine Champion Quarter Running Horses. Ultimately, his ownership and breeding rights were split into 60 shares worth $500,000 each—a total of $30 million. By 1993, the year after his death, his <a href="foal">foal</a>s had earned more than $25 million on the racetrack.

Longtime Quarter Horse <a href="horse%20breeding">breeder</a> and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of <a href="Sayre%2C%20Oklahoma">Sayre, Oklahoma</a>, bred Easy Jet from two future AQHA Hall of Fame members, <a href="Jet%20Deck">Jet Deck</a> and <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> mare <a href="Lena%27s%20Bar">Lena's Bar</a> in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had produced a small number of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from <a href="Three%20Bars">Three Bars</a>, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also in the Hall of Fame.

Easy Jet was of <a href="Sorrel%20%28horse%29">sorrel</a> color, a light yellowish-red. When fully grown, he stood about 15.3 <a href="Hand%20%28unit%29">hands</a> high (63 inches; 160 cm) and weighed about . He had a large star and a stripe on his face.

Of Easy Jet's stamina and busy training regimen, Merrick said, "I guess he ate at night; I don't know when else. It was unbelievable the amount of energy he had". Training for the race track generally begins when a horse is a long <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a>—between one and a half and two years of age. Easy Jet was so easy to train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional <a href="horse%20trainer">trainer</a>. In a practice race at the ranch, Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth. Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320 m) race. Easy Jet's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Downs">Blue Ribbon Downs</a>, which the colt won by more than a length.

Easy Jet raced for two years, starting 38 races. He won 27 of his races, came in second seven times and third twice, and placed below third only twice, with race earnings totaling $445,721 (approximately $ as of 2019). He earned an AQHA <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Superior Race Horse</a> award along with his <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Race Register of Merit</a>. A Superior Race horse must have earned at least 200 AQHA racing points by winning races, and even more in stakes races. A Race Register of Merit is the lowest level of racing award earned from the AQHA, and is gained when a horse attains a speed rating of 80 in a race, whether or not it wins the race. His best speed rating was AAAT, which was the highest grade awarded at the time he was racing. Over his two-year career, he won 12 stakes races, and placed second in four and third in one.

In 1969, his first official year on the track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">stakes race</a>s. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track. His jockey, Willie Lovell, explained that he needed to do very little to win: "In the stretch, when I saw Easy Jet had it, I let him run his own race. All I had to do was just sit there and let him roll." His time of 20.46 seconds to cover was remarkable considering that three days of rain before the start of the race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at <a href="Sallisaw%2C%20Oklahoma">Sallisaw</a>, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92 seconds for . The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.

At the end of the 1969 racing season, he was named <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">World Champion Quarter Running Horse</a>, Champion Quarter Running Stallion, and Champion Quarter Running Two-Year Old Colt by the AQHA. He was also the highest money-earning horse and only the fourth two-year-old to be named World Champion. During his first year of racing, he started 26 times, won 22 and placed (came in second) in another three. Most two-year-old Quarter Horses race on average under five times in their first year of racing, and the average for all ages is just over five starts per year. Many people criticized Merrick for starting Easy Jet so often. Merrick said, however, "You had to run him about once every ten days or he'd have got so high you couldn't hardly stand to be around him. As long as we were going to run him, we figured we might as well make it count for something." Despite all of the starts, Easy Jet had enough energy to be difficult to handle; in this respect, he was considered high-spirited rather than mean.

In 1970, he started 12 times, and won five times, placed second four times, and earned third place twice. His only unplaced finish was in the Rainbow Derby finals, where he came in dead last. Before he started racing that year, he stood at stud to a full book of mares, breeding as many mares as his owners would allow, which limited his racing time. During the Rocky Mountain Quarter Horse Derby at Centennial Park in <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, on October 4, 1970, which Easy Jet won without ever relinquishing the lead, the stallion became the highest-earning Quarter Horse racer of all time, with earnings of more than $440,000 ($ as of 2019). At the end of the year, he was named Champion Quarter Running Stallion and Champion Quarter Running Three-Year Old Colt.

Before his retirement from racing in 1970, Easy Jet had already started standing at stud, returning to the track only after the breeding season. In 1971, his first foals arrived. His offspring began racing in 1973 and soon put Easy Jet on the AQHA Leading Sires of Race Winners list. With their success, his stud fee, or the cost of breeding a mare to him, rose from $2,000 (approximately $ as of 2019) in 1971 to $5,000 ($ as of 2019) in 1973; by 1980, it was $30,000 (approximately $ as of 2019).

In 1971, Merrick sold a half-interest in Easy Jet and his full brother Jet Smooth to Joe McDermott, and five years later, in 1976, the partners sold Easy Jet to the Buena Suerte Ranch for $3.57 million (approximately $ as of 2019). Later, after two of the partners in the ranch died unexpectedly, Merrick re-purchased Easy Jet and bought a controlling share in the ranch. In 1980, the stallion was syndicated for $30 million (approximately $ as of 2019), a record amount at the time. The syndicate had 50 shares, each costing $600,000 (approximately $ as of 2019). The <a href="1980s%20oil%20glut">oil bust</a> of the 1980s, and changes in US tax laws affecting horse operations, led to financial problems for the horse market in general and the syndicate, which led to financial difficulties for Merrick and resulted in many changes of ownership for Easy Jet until the death of the champion in 1992.

After retiring to stud full-time, he had a very successful career. He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter <a href="Easy%20Date">Easy Date</a> won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses already mentioned, the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and Megahertz. His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various points in time, Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth. As a <a href="broodmare">broodmare</a> sire, or maternal grandsire, of racehorses, Easy Jet led the All-time leading lists by winners in March 2008, and the same list ordered by earnings had him second. As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on the racetrack. In total, he sired 2,507 foals in 25 years of breeding.

Easy Jet was <a href="animal%20euthanasia">euthanized</a> in 1992 due to <a href="laminitis">laminitis</a>, a disease of the hoof. He was buried in his paddock on Walter Merrick's 14 Ranch near Sayre, Oklahoma. Merrick was unable to bring himself to see the horse before he was put down. He said, "I couldn't go, I just couldn't see him like that. He was too good a friend". Easy Jet was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1993.

Postage stamps of Ireland

The postage stamps of Ireland are issued by the <a href="Postal%20administration">postal operator</a> of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">independent Irish state</a>. Ireland was part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> when the world's first postage stamps were issued in 1840. These stamps, and all subsequent British issues, were used in Ireland until the new <a href="Irish%20Government">Irish Government</a> assumed power in 1922. Beginning on 17 February 1922, existing British stamps were <a href="overprint">overprint</a>ed with Irish text to provide some <a href="definitive%20stamp">definitives</a> until separate Irish issues became available. Following the overprints, a regular series of definitive stamps was produced by the new <a href="Minister%20for%20Posts%20and%20Telegraphs">Department of Posts and Telegraphs</a>, using domestic designs. These definitives were issued on 6 December 1922; the first was a 2d stamp, depicting a map of Ireland (including <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, which remained a part of the United Kingdom). Since then new images, and additional values as needed, have produced of nine definitive series of different designs.

These were the major stamp productions for everyday use. <a href="Commemorative%20stamp">Commemorative stamp</a>s first appeared in 1929, and these now appear several times a year, celebrating many aspects of Irish life, such as notable events and anniversaries, Irish life and culture, and many famous <a href="List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20Ireland">Irish people</a>. Some definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced in <a href="miniature%20sheet">miniature sheet</a>, <a href="Postage%20stamp%20booklet">booklet</a> and <a href="Coil%20stamp">coil</a> configurations in addition to the common sheet layout. <a href="Postage%20due">Postage due</a>s and <a href="airmail">airmail</a>s complete the stamp issues of the two, sequential, Irish stamp-issuing authorities. Two styles of <a href="watermark">watermark</a> were used though the overprinted issues came with the watermarks of the British stamps provided for overprinting by the <a href="Post%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Post Office</a>.

"Oifig an Phoist", the Irish Post Office, was the section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which issued all Irish stamps up to 1984. After the division of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into two <a href="State-sponsored%20bodies%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland">semi-state organisations</a> in 1984, <a href="An%20Post">An Post</a> took over the responsibility for all Irish <a href="mail">postal</a> services including the issuing of postage stamps.

To identify postage stamps used in Ireland between 1840 and 1922, it is necessary to identify the <a href="postmark">postmark</a> cancelling the stamp as being from an <a href="List%20of%20towns%20in%20Ireland">Irish town</a>. Stamps used during this period are referred to as "Great Britain used in Ireland".

From 1840 to 1844, the <a href="Penny%20Black">Penny Black</a>, and other stamps issued, were obliterated with the <a href="Maltese%20Cross">Maltese Cross</a> <a href="Cancellation%20%28mail%29">cancellation</a>. There was no text or numeral to help identify any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="Eyrecourt">Eyrecourt</a>, <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, <a href="Hollymount">Hollymount</a>, <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a> and <a href="Mullingar">Mullingar</a>. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the <a href="post%20town">post town</a>. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a <a href="Cover%20%28philately%29">cover</a>, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification of the town of use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.

Between 1922 and 1983 "Oifig an Phoist", the Irish Post Office, a section of the <a href="Minister%20for%20Posts%20and%20Telegraphs">Department of Posts and Telegraphs</a> (P&T), issued all postage stamps in the 26 <a href="counties%20of%20Ireland">counties of Ireland</a>. During this time they employed some of the following companies to <a href="overprint">overprint</a> or <a href="Security%20printing">print</a> the stamps: Dollard, Thom, Irish Government Printers, <a href="Waterlow%20and%20Sons">Waterlow and Sons</a> (London), <a href="De%20La%20Rue">De La Rue and Co.</a>, <a href="Bradbury%20Wilkinson">Bradbury Wilkinson</a> and Co., Ltd., (London), <a href="Harrison%20and%20Sons">Harrison and Sons</a> Ltd., (London) and Irish Security Stamp Printing Ltd.

Since 1984, "<a href="An%20Post">An Post</a>" has issued all Irish postage stamps. Most have been printed by Irish Security Stamp Printing Ltd., though a small number were printed by Harrison and Sons Ltd., (London), Questa, Walsall Security Printing, Prinset Pty Ltd., (Australia) and SNP Cambec (Sprintpak) (Australia).

In <a href="stamp%20collecting">stamp collecting</a> circles, the word "<a href="Forerunner%20%28stamp%29">forerunner</a>" usually describes a postage stamp used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as "Handbook of Irish Philately", the term "forerunners" usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail and they had no <a href="Standing%20%28law%29">legal standing</a> for mail in Ireland.

Four values, 1c, 3c, 24c (deep-green), and 24c (mauve-purple) were produced in New York by the Irish veterans of the US Civil War and are known as the 1865–67 Fenian issue. The 1893 colonial design are unofficial <a href="Essay%20%28philately%29">essays</a> and are classed as <a href="Philatelic%20fakes%20and%20forgeries%23Bogus%20stamps">bogus</a>.

Between 1907 and 1916, <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, one of the nationalist organisations of the time, issued propaganda labels symbolising Irish <a href="Independence">nationhood</a>. Their use as stamps was forbidden by Post Office regulations. The first design was a <a href="Celtic%20Cross">Celtic Cross</a>, similar to one later adopted for two definitive stamps of 1923, and the second depicts a female figure and <a href="harp">harp</a> in an oval frame. In 1912, labels inscribed "Imperial Union" appeared, with a design of a larger harp and female figure. These labels, expressing <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a> sentiments, are believed to have been printed in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> as a counter to the Sinn Féin labels. After the <a href="Home%20Rule%20Act%201914">Home Rule</a> Bill for Ireland was passed in parliament, an Irish Republican body issued labels in 1916 with the portraits of three nationalist heroes known as "<a href="Manchester%20Martyrs">The Manchester Martyrs</a>" against an <a href="Irish%20tricolour">Irish tricolour</a> background. Forgeries of these labels are common. Following the <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> of 1916, American sympathisers printed eight "ERIE PUIST" labels showing portraits of seven prominent leaders and a "harp and shamrock" label. The misspelling ERIE for <a href="%C3%89ire">ÉIRE</a> could have been because of hasty preparation.

The <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%931969%29">Irish Republican Army</a>, that controlled much of the southern part of the country during the <a href="Irish%20civil%20war">Irish civil war</a>, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were to be put on sale in August 1922, but in the meantime the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own <a href="barracks">barracks</a> before they retreated from Cork, destroying most of the labels.

The <a href="Minister%20for%20Posts%20and%20Telegraphs">Postmaster General of the Irish Free State</a> issued an invitation to firms in Dublin and London on 1 February 1922 for the submission of designs for a permanent definitive stamp issue, and by March several designs had been submitted. The following companies and printers provided <a href="Essay%20%28philately%29">essays</a>: Dollard Printing House Ltd., Hely Ltd., <a href="Perkins%20Bacon">Perkins Bacon & Co.</a>, and O'Loughlin, Murphy & Boland.

In 1922, as an interim measure before the first specially designed definitives were ready, a series of contemporary stamps of <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> were <a href="overprint">overprint</a>ed. The unoverprinted stamps were issued and in use in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1912 and 1922 and continued in use in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> until 1936. Three printing firms held overprinting contracts: Dollard Printing House Ltd., Alex. Thom & Co Ltd., and Harrison & Sons. In June 1925 the Government Printers, <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a>, obtained the contract and completed all overprinting until 1937, when the final, high-value stamps were issued.

Collecting and identifying the overprints can be an arduous task as there are numerous variations in the overprint settings. <a href="David%20Feldman%20%28philatelist%29">Feldman</a> states "the complex details of plating, shading, overprint colours, accurate measurements, to mention a few, often discourage even the most enthusiastic collector". Three specialised books, or catalogue chapters, (Freeman & Stubbs, Munk and Meredith), issued within five years of issue have concentrated on this topic and Meredith is regarded as unequalled.

Two distinct overprints were made, before and after the formal independence of the state on 6 December 1922. The <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Ireland">Provisional Government of Ireland</a> ("Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann") overprints were initially issued on 17 February 1922, with eight low-value and three high-value stamps overprinted by Dollard and four by Thom. This overprint is composed of the four words "Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann" and the numeral date "1922" arranged in five lines of <a href="serif">serif</a>fed text. The unoverprinted stamps remained valid for postage in Ireland until 31 March 1922.

The <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> ("Saorstát Éireann") overprints debuted on 11 December 1922. This is a three-line overprint using a <a href="sans-serif">sans-serif</a> typeface and was done by Thom, Harrison and the Government Printers. The last overprinted stamps were the Waterlow & Sons re-engraved King George V 2/6, 5/- and 10/- values that appeared in 1934 and were overprinted in 1937 for use in Ireland.

On stamps, the name of the state has always been written in <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> and rarely also written in English. The overprints were stamped first "Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann" ("Provisional Government of Ireland") and later "Saorstát Éireann" ("Irish Free State"). Subsequent stamps nearly all used the name "Éire" ("Ireland"), even though this was not the name of the state until the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Ireland">1937 Constitution</a> took effect. The exceptions were issued in 1949 and 1950, and used "POBLAĊT NA hÉIREANN" or "Poblacht na h-Éireann" ("Republic of Ireland"). This phrase is the official "description" of the state specified in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201948">Republic of Ireland Act</a>, which came into force in April 1949; the state's "name" was not changed by the Act. <a href="Fianna%20F%C3%A1il">Fianna Fáil</a> defeated the outgoing government in the <a href="Irish%20general%20election%2C%201951">1951 election</a> and abandoned the use of the description, reverting to the name on stamps and elsewhere. Originally, "Éire" was written in <a href="Gaelic%20type">Gaelic type</a>; from 1952 to 1979, many stamps had the name of the state in <a href="Roman%20type">Roman type</a>, usually in <a href="all%20caps">all caps</a>, and often written "EIRE" rather than "ÉIRE", omitting the "<a href="s%C3%ADneadh%20fada">síneadh fada</a>" accent over the initial 'E'. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recommended the inclusion of the word "Ireland" along with "Éire" on stamps but the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Taoiseach">Department of the Taoiseach</a> vetoed the idea on the basis it could cause "constitutional and political repercussions" and that "the change could be unwelcome."

Since 1922, nine Irish definitive stamp series have been released. Besides different designs, there were changes involving the <a href="watermark">watermark</a> and eventually doing away with watermarked paper, changes in currency were also reflected on the stamps: <a href="Decimal%20Day">decimalisation</a> in 1971, and <a href="Introduction%20of%20the%20euro">Euro changeover</a> in 2002.

The first twelve stamps, the low values up to 1 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>, were issued during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: "Sword of Light", "Map of Ireland", "<a href="Celtic%20Cross">Celtic Cross</a>", "Arms of the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Ireland">Four Provinces</a>" and "St. Patrick". Watermark and extra values were made until new designs, known as the "Gerl definitives", using early <a href="Irish%20art">Irish art</a> <a href="Motif%20%28art%29">motifs</a>, were produced in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal <a href="Irish%20pound">Irish pound</a>s and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.

Between 1982 and 1988 a series based on Irish architecture through the ages was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a> followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish <a href="birds">birds</a> feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the <a href="Irish%20pound">Irish pound</a>, through dual currency to the introduction of the <a href="Euro">Euro</a>. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.
For the centenary of the <a href="Easter%20Rising">1916 Easter Rising</a> an eighth series of definitive stamps were issued on 21 January 2016 and will only be on sale for a period of one year. There are sixteen stamps divided into four groups of four categories named as: Leaders and Icons, Participants, Easter Week and The Aftermath.

Following the withdrawal of the limited edition 1916 commemoration definitives, the ninth series made its debut on 13 January 2017 with an initial twelve designs based on objects described in "<a href="A%20History%20of%20Ireland%20in%20100%20Objects">A History of Ireland in 100 Objects</a>", a book by <a href="Fintan%20O%27Toole">Fintan O'Toole</a>. The introduction included eight different SOAR stamps (Stamps on a Roll), a range of coil stamps, and a domestic and a foreign rate stamp booklet that each illustrate different objects. Some of the objects illustrated are the Tara <a href="Torc">Torc</a>s, Broighter Boat and <a href="Old%20Croghan%20Man">Old Croghan Man</a> Armlet. The balance of the series will be issued over the next five or six years.

Several Irish definitives have been issued in <a href="Postage%20stamp%20booklet">booklet</a> and <a href="Coil%20stamp">coil</a> formats in addition to the normal sheet configuration.

Irish postage stamps have been released to commemorate a wide variety of Irish topics, such as Irish notable events and anniversaries, aspects of Irish life and culture, <a href="List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20Ireland">famous Irish people</a> (statesmen, religious, literary and cultural figures, athletes, etc.), <a href="fauna">fauna</a> and <a href="flora">flora</a>, works of art, and <a href="Christmas%20stamp">Christmas</a>. <a href="Europa%20postage%20stamp">Europa postage stamp</a>s have been issued since 1960 to celebrate membership of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), and international events have also been commemorated.

The first commemorative, a set of three <a href="Daniel%20O%27Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a> stamps, appeared on 22 June 1929. Until the mid-1990s, with only three exceptions in 1943, 1977 and 1979 for <a href="Douglas%20Hyde">Douglas Hyde</a>, <a href="Louis%20le%20Brocquy">Louis le Brocquy</a> and <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> respectively, it was policy to not depict living persons. This policy has been put aside and since 1995 there have been several such issues, mainly depicting athletes; for instance 30 stamps were issued showing living Irish sportsmen for the <a href="Millennium">Millennium</a> and several golfers are shown on three <a href="2006%20Ryder%20Cup">2006 Ryder Cup</a> stamps.

Some stamps were issued in the form of a miniature sheet comprising from one to sixteen stamps of a single, or multiple, design from one issue printed on the same sheet and sold in that <a href="paper%20size">format</a>. The miniature sheets are most often produced in addition to the same designs issued as single stamps.

The first miniature sheet of four <a href="stamp%20on%20stamp">stamp on stamp</a> postage stamps was issued in 1972 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first Irish postage stamp.
This was followed by a four-stamp sheet to commemorate the bicentenary of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>; the stamps in this sheet were also available as single stamps. A set of four stamps showing Irish <a href="wildlife">wildlife</a> was issued in sheet form and also as single stamps in 1980.

Since 1983 miniature sheets have been produced with increasing frequency, from at least one per year initially to several sheets more recently.

Seven Irish <a href="airmail%20stamp">airmail stamp</a>s were issued between 1948 and 1965 in the 1d, 3d, 6d, 8d, 1/-, 1/3 and 1/5 values. No specific airmail rate existed for the 1d and 3d stamps though their use was permitted on non-airmail correspondence; all others paid a contemporaneous rate when first produced. These were the only airmail stamps ever issued but many definitives and commemoratives have been produced in values that paid the postage rate for airmail service.
The stamps were designed by <a href="Richard%20King%20%28artist%29">Richard J. King</a> and <a href="Photogravure">recess</a> printed by Waterlow and Sons, London, until 1961, and thereafter by <a href="De%20La%20Rue">De La Rue & Co</a>, Dublin. The designs feature the "Flight of the Angel Victor – Messenger of <a href="Saint%20Patrick">St. Patrick</a> – carrying the Voice of the Irish 'Vox <a href="Hibernia">Hiberniæ</a>' over the world" flying over four well-known Irish historical landmarks, one from each of the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Ireland">four provinces of Ireland</a>: <a href="Lough%20Derg%20%28Donegal%29">Lough Derg</a> (3d and 8d values), <a href="Rock%20of%20Cashel">Rock of Cashel</a> (1d, 1/3 and 1/5 values), <a href="Glendalough">Glendalough</a> (1/- value) and <a href="Croagh%20Patrick">Croagh Patrick</a> (6d value). These were printed in sheets of 60 stamps with an 'e' <a href="watermark">watermark</a>.
Surcharges imposed by the Irish post office on mail bearing insufficient pre-paid postage had the <a href="postage%20due">postage due</a> collected by the use of these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> word "pingin", for <a href="penny">penny</a>, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word <a href="%C3%89ire">Éire</a> in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.

The first issue consisted of four values released on 20 February 1925; d, 1d, 2d and 6d. Typographed by the Government Printers in Dublin Castle on 'se' watermarked paper. The sheets were printed in larger sheets of 180 divided into three panes of 60 labels. The second issue had ten values: d, 1d, 1d, 2d, 3d, 5d, 6d, 8d, 10d and 1/-, and were printed on 'e' watermarked paper between 1940 and 1969. Other details are the same.

A third issue was made up of seven labels and issued in decimal currency in the following values: 1p, 1p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 7p and 8p. In the fourth issue the 3p, 4p and 5p values were reissued in non-watermarked paper on 20 March 1978. A new design, printed by <a href="photogravure">photogravure</a>, and appeared on 20 June 1980 in ten values: 1p, 2p, 4p, 6p, 8p, 18p, 20p, 24p, 30p and 50p made up the fifth issue. The sheet format was two panes of 100 divided by a <a href="Gutter%20%28philately%29">gutter margin</a>. The sixth issue consisted of ten newly designed labels by "Q Design" and lithographically printed by ISSP on non-watermarked paper on 6 October 1988. The values were: 1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 17p, 20p, 24p, 30p, 50p and £1. No Euro currency postage dues have been produced.

<a href="Postage%20stamp%20booklet">Stamp booklets</a> were first put on sale on 21 August 1931. Booklet construction was a lightweight <a href="Paperboard">cardboard</a> cover <a href="Lockstitch">stitched</a> on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and interleaving bound in. Until 1956 most booklets had half of the front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had serial numbers on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the serial numbers ceased.
Since 1983, most booklets are no longer stitched; the stamp pane, or panes, are glued into a folded card cover.

Until 1988, when the <a href="Irish%20anniversary%20festivals">Dublin Millennium</a> booklet containing commemorative stamps was issued, all booklets contained only definitive stamps. Since then, An Post has issued both commemorative and definitive booklets, with three times as many commemorative booklets issued. In 1990 An Post issued the first booklet mixing definitive and commemorative stamps in one booklet and also on a single pane.

Many booklet stamps can be identified by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on the left of the booklet.

The Irish overprinted stamps came, as supplied from the printers in London, with a watermark of the <a href="Royal%20Cypher">Royal Cypher</a> of <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George V</a>. The first Irish watermark was a stylised design of the two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing the name of the country "<a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Saorstát Éireann</a>". This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to "<a href="%C3%89ire">Éire</a>" (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.

Around 1971, the use of watermarks was discontinued by the Irish stamp-issuing authority, and current stamps issued by "An Post" do not use a watermarked paper.

<a href="Postal%20stationery">Postal stationery</a> have been produced in the form of registered envelopes, <a href="postal%20card">postal card</a>s, envelopes, letter cards, <a href="newspaper%20wrapper">newspaper wrapper</a>s, <a href="Air%20letter%20sheet">airletters</a> and <a href="telegram">telegram</a> forms with different designs of <a href="Indicia%20%28philately%29">impressed stamp</a> applied to show that postage had been pre-paid. Except for limited early usage of previously issued British postal stationery, which were not overprinted like the postage stamps, all post-paid impressed stamps before 1984 were based on variations of a design showing the country's name in Irish, "Éire", with appropriate values in text and numeral tablets centred around an <a href="Irish%20harp">Irish harp</a> motif. This was initially superseded by a <a href="shamrock">shamrock</a> design that later became loosely based on the logo of wavy lines and the word "POST" used by An Post from 1984. An Post has also used some designs based on postage stamps as post-paid impressed stamps on Irish postal stationery.

A few early issued items were embossed but generally the post-paid impressed stamps were typographed. The Revenue Stamping Branch, <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a>, applied the impressed indicia until 1984, when An Post employed the typographic printing method.

At independence, a King George V 5-pence registered envelope and 1-shilling telegram form were printed in green for use in Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing outdated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other products have carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Day">St. Patrick's Day</a> cards issued annually since 1984.

Up to 1987, airletters (also known as aerogrammes) were produced without any fee applied and were available free from post offices upon payment of the appropriate rate in force for the postage stamp purchased to mail the airletter. Most airletters with a pre-paid indicia have been sold at a small premium over the then-current aerogramme postal rate.

Known as the "stamping privilege", companies, <a href="Voluntary%20association">associations</a> and <a href="individuals">individuals</a> were permitted to submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for <a href="printed%20matter">printed matter</a> rate mail. The most prolific user was the <a href="Electricity%20Supply%20Board">Electricity Supply Board</a> which used <a href="Electricity%20meter%23Electromechanical%20meters">meter reading</a> and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included <a href="Blackrock%20College">Blackrock College</a>, <a href="C%C3%B3ras%20Iompair%20%C3%89ireann">Córas Iompair Éireann</a>, <a href="Esso">Esso</a>, <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Ireland%29">Great Northern Railway</a>, and <a href="John%20Player%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">John Player & Sons</a>, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the "stamping privilege" without any <a href="public%20notice">public notice</a>, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post took control of the Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.

Newly issued Irish postage stamps are available from the Philatelic Bureau of <a href="An%20Post">An Post</a> in the <a href="General%20Post%20Office%20%28Dublin%29">Dublin, General Post Office</a>. Commemorative and special issue stamps are usually available for one year from the date of issue. Until the mid-1960s the Irish stamp-issuing policy was very conservative, with only a few new ones each year; up to four or five commemoratives, usually of two values, plus the occasional updated, or new, definitives. During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.

Some collectors try to acquire a basic <a href="Collecting">collection</a> of the more common stamps from 1922 onwards, though that can be difficult now due to the quantity issued. Many collectors concentrate on one type of stamp, such as definitives or commemoratives, or even one issue, such as Gerl definitives. The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older issues are harder to find because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed in the early years (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.

The <a href="overprint">overprint</a>s, which proved very popular during their early years, are a complex topic giving an advanced collector a great philatelic challenge.

The Irish Post Office has never publicised an official stamp numbering system for the postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a <a href="stamp%20numbering%20system">stamp numbering system</a> from one of the most popular <a href="stamp%20catalogue">stamp catalogue</a>s, such as <a href="Stanley%20Gibbons">Stanley Gibbons</a>, <a href="Scott%20catalog">Scott</a>, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or <a href="Michel%20catalog">Michel</a>. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually varieties that the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d "Map of Ireland", issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.

Collectors tend to use the catalogues produced in their own region and language, so in the United States, Scott is used most often as evidenced by the use of Scott numbers in American stamp auction catalogues. In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries. Advanced and more specialist collectors have used the David Feldman, later called MacDonnell/Feldman, and later again called MacDonnellWhyte, catalogues between 1978 and 1991, and Hibernian catalogues (1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986, 2002 and 2009 editions).

Diary of a Camper

Diary of a Camper is a short American film made using <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s 1996 <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> "<a href="Quake%20%28video%20game%29">Quake</a>", released in 1996. It was created by <a href="United%20Ranger%20Films">United Ranger Films</a>, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or <a href="clan%20%28gaming%29">clan</a>, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> as a non-interactive <a href="game%20demo">game demo</a> file. The video is generally considered the first known example of <a href="machinima">machinima</a>—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>s, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone <a href="camping%20%28computer%20gaming%29">camper</a>, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a <a href="deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">deathmatch</a>, a type of <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer game</a> in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.

Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or <a href="speedrun">speedrun</a>s, attempts to complete a <a href="level%20%28computer%20and%20video%20games%29">map</a> as quickly as possible. "Diary of a Camper" was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.

"Diary of a Camper" occurs entirely within the "Quake" map DM6 ("The Dark Zone"). After exploring some of the area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. After they teleport into the room, a <a href="camping%20%28gaming%29">camper</a> waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the <a href="Gib%20%28video%20gaming%29">remains</a>, they identify their foe as <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a>.

"Diary of a Camper" is built on the ability to record gameplay, which appeared earlier in id Software's <a href="1993%20in%20video%20gaming">1993 computer game</a> "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>". Using this feature, players could efficiently record game events, rather than the rendered video itself, and later replay them in real-time through the game engine. "Doom"s successor, "Quake", offered new opportunities for both multiplayer gameplay and customization, while preserving the demo recording ability. In the book "Machinima", Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd stated that multiplayer games became popular, almost a sport, and demo files of matches were recorded and studied. <a href="Paul%20Marino">Paul Marino</a>, executive director of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Machinima%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences</a> (AMAS), used a different analogy: "Players began to record deathmatches with a more cinematic flair... "[T]he viewpoint of the player became the viewpoint of a director.""

Well known for their playing skill and their ability to program <a href="mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29">game modifications</a>, the Rangers conceived the idea to use "Quake" for filmmaking in August 1996 and released "Diary of a Camper" on October 26, 1996. The group's new demo surprised the "Quake" community by exploiting the game differently. According to Henry Lowood, "Diary of a Camper" contains the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but in the context of a simple story instead of the usual deathmatch. A "<a href="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a>" article compared the events of the film to those of a typical deathmatch. Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in "Quake"s networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but "it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, ... delivering their lines as plain text..." Lowood stated that ""Diary of a Camper" breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay" because the spectator's perspective is independent "from that of any player/actor; the movie is not 'shot' from the first-person perspective of the shooter." Lowood called the film a "transformation of competitive play to ... minimal theatrical play", emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as the camper.

Before "Diary of a Camper"s release, Uwe Girlich, a German doctoral candidate, had documented the "Quake" demo file format, in which "the player coordinates and the camera positions may be different". He added that "for people with too much spare-time "Quake" can replace a full 3D modelling system". However, the Rangers developed "Diary of a Camper" before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric "ArchV" Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and to splice recorded footage. As with all of United Ranger Films' productions, Heath "ColdSun" Brown wrote the story, and Matt "Unknown Soldier" Van Sickler was the director. In the release notes, Brown credits clan members Chris "Sphinx" Birke and Mute with helping Fowler with "movie packaging".

"Diary of a Camper" and the films that it inspired were initially called ""Quake" movies"; the term "machinima" was later coined in 1998, in response to the increasing use of other game engines. There was initial hesitance to retroactively label "Diary of a Camper" the first machinima piece; a <a href="Machinima.com">Machinima.com</a> article from February 2000 opened, "It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the <a href="Stunt%20Island">Stunt Island</a> stuff and the <a href="demoscene">Demo Scene</a> all compete for the title. However, it's a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper". Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" to separate machinima from its creative lineage. Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines "Diary of a Camper" as the first machinima work. Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of "documented gameplay".

Despite "Diary of a Camper"s importance in establishing machinima, commentators have criticized the film's actual content. Marino called the plot "simple"; likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that "it wasn't much of a story", and Lowood wrote that "the plot offers little more than a brief sequence of inside jokes". Among major "Quake" movie review sites, Roger Matthews of the "Quake" Movie Library called the film "not much more than a deathmatch with a camera". On Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates wrote, "This movie is "dull". It is "not very interesting"." Stephen Lum of The Cineplex criticized the film for its "weird humour".

Although "Quake" movie critics found shortcomings in "Diary of a Camper", they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that "the camera work was very nice and never once screwed up", and Lum gave the film "a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [it] started the Quake Movie craze". Of the major "Quake" movie review sites, only The Cineplex gave "Diary" a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10. Matthews and Coates rated the film 20%, and 2 out of 10, respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, "I feel I overreacted at the fact that DoaC was old. It's the first "ever" Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that... But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit."

Because of its significance, "Diary of a Camper" continues to be featured in machinima presentations. It was one of the first works to be included in the Machinima Archive, a collaboration among <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, the <a href="Internet%20Archive">Internet Archive</a>, the AMAS, and <a href="machinima.com">machinima.com</a>. In a 2005 event at Stanford University, the film was presented with later machinima works, such as "<a href="Red%20vs.%20Blue">Red vs. Blue</a>". Likewise, the <a href="Australian%20Centre%20for%20the%20Moving%20Image">Australian Centre for the Moving Image</a> included it in a 2006 machinima exhibit.

Nemegtomaia

Nemegtomaia is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> from what is now <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> that lived in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 70million years ago. The first specimen was found in 1996, and became the basis of the new genus and species N. barsboldi in 2004. The original genus name was "Nemegtia", but this was changed to "Nemegtomaia" in 2005, as the former name was <a href="preoccupied">preoccupied</a>. The first part of the generic name refers to the <a href="Nemegt%20Basin">Nemegt Basin</a>, where the animal was found, and the second part means "good mother", in reference to the fact that oviraptorids are known to have <a href="brooded">brooded</a> their eggs. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honours the palaeontologist <a href="Rinchen%20Barsbold">Rinchen Barsbold</a>. Two more specimens were found in 2007, one of which was found on top of a nest with eggs, but the dinosaur had received its genus name before it was found associated with eggs.

"Nemegtomaia" is estimated to have been around 2 m (7 ft) in length, and to have weighed 40 kg (85 lb). As an <a href="oviraptorosaur">oviraptorosaur</a>, it would have been feathered. It had a deep, narrow, and short skull, with an arched crest. It was toothless, had a short snout with a <a href="parrot">parrot</a>-like beak, and a pair of tooth-like projections on its <a href="palate">palate</a>. It had three fingers; the first was largest and bore a strong claw. "Nemegtomaia" is classified as a member of the oviraptorid subfamily <a href="Ingeniinae">Ingeniinae</a>, and it the only known member of this group with a <a href="Skull">cranial</a> crest. Though "Nemegtomaia" has been used to suggest that <a href="oviraptorosaurs">oviraptorosaurs</a> were <a href="flightless%20birds">flightless birds</a>, the <a href="clade">clade</a> is generally considered a group of non-<a href="bird">avian</a> dinosaurs.

The nesting "Nemegtomaia" specimen was placed on top of what was probably a ring of eggs, with its arms folded across them. None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5to 6 cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14to 16 cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The specimen was found in a <a href="stratigraphic">stratigraphic</a> area that indicates "Nemegtomaia" preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. "Nemegtomaia" may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was <a href="scavenged">scavenged</a> by <a href="skin%20beetles">skin beetles</a>. The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a>. "Nemegtomaia" is known from the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt</a> and <a href="Baruungoyot%20Formations">Baruungoyot Formations</a>, which are thought to represent <a href="humid">humid</a> and <a href="arid">arid</a> environments that coexisted in the same area,

"Nemegtomaia" is estimated to have been around 2 m (7 ft) in length, and to have weighed 40 kg (85 lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an <a href="Oviraptorosauria">oviraptorosaur</a>, it would have been feathered. The neural spines of the neck (<a href="Cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a>) vertebrae were short, and the <a href="neural%20arch">neural arch</a>es had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185 mm (7 in) in total length. The <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) had a <a href="Fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossa</a> (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152 mm (6 in) long. The <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144 mm (5 in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong <a href="ungual">ungual</a> (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) is estimated to have been 286 mm (11 in) long, and the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> of the lower leg 317 mm long (12 in).

The skull of "Nemegtomaia" was deep, narrow, and short (compared to the rest of the body), and reached 179 mm (7 in) in length. It had a well-developed crest, formed by the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal</a> and <a href="premaxilla%20bones">premaxilla bones</a> (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the holotype's crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a>s, the nasal processes (projections) of the premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye opening) was 52 mm (2 in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> (openings); a large <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. "Nemegtomaia" was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a> on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a> from front to back. The <a href="nares">nares</a> (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.

The jaws of "Nemegtomaia" were toothless, and like other oviraptorid dinosaurs, it had a short snout with a deep, robust, and somewhat <a href="parrot">parrot</a>-like beak. It had a hard <a href="palate">palate</a> formed by the premaxillae, <a href="vomers">vomers</a>, and <a href="maxillae">maxillae</a>, like other oviraptorids. The palate was strongly concave (downwards-projecting), and had a cleft on the central part. As in other oviraptorids, it had a pair of tooth-like projections on the palate that were directed downwards (a feature that has been called "pseudo-teeth"). "Nemegtomaia" had small <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings) on the sides of the <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> (joint) between the premaxillae at the front of the snout, which may have been nutrient openings (and which indicate the presence of a <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> bill). The lower jaw was short and deep, with a convex lower surface, and reached 153 mm (6 in) in length. The <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a> of the lower jaw reached 50 mm (2 in) at its highest point. The <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (where the two-halves of the lower jaw connected) was short, deep, and very <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumatised</a> (with air-spaces). The mandibular fenestra was large and was located at the front part of the lower jaw. As in most other oviraptorids, the front of the lower jaw was down-turned.

Though "Nemegtomaia" does not possess any single feature that distinguishes it from other oviraptorids (<a href="autapomorphies">autapomorphies</a>), the combination of a crest, an enlarged first finger, and a high number of <a href="sacral%20vertebrae">sacral vertebrae</a> (eight), is unique to this <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

In 1996 the Japanese palaeontologist Yoshitsugu Kobayashi (as part of the "Mongolian Highland International Dinosaur Project" team) found an incomplete skeleton of an oviraptorid dinosaur in the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a> of the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> in southwestern <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. The specimen (MPC-D100/2112 at the Mongolian Palaeontological Center, formerly PC and GIN100/2112), consists of a nearly complete skull and a partial skeleton, including cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, a left scapula, the lower ends of both humeri, the right radius, both ilia, the upper ends of both pubic bones, both ischia, and the upper end of a femur. The specimen was described as a new specimen of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Ingenia" (referred to as "Ingenia" sp.; of uncertain species) by the Chinese palaeontologist <a href="L%C3%BC%20Junchang">Lü Junchang</a> and colleagues in 2002, and used to highlight the similarities between oviraptorosaurs and birds.

In 2004 Lü and colleagues determined that the skeleton belonged to a new, distinct taxon, and made it the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of "Nemegtia barsboldi". The genus name refers to the <a href="Nemegt%20Basin">Nemegt Basin</a>, and the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honours the Mongolian palaeontologist <a href="Rinchen%20Barsbold">Rinchen Barsbold</a>, the leader of the team that found the specimen. In 2005 the describers discovered (after being notified by a biologist) that the name "Nemegtia" had already been used for a genus of freshwater <a href="seed%20shrimp">seed shrimp</a> (Ostracoda) from the same formation in 1978, and was therefore <a href="preoccupied">preoccupied</a>. They proposed instead the new genus name "Nemegtomaia" (""maia"" means "good mother" in Greek, and the full name means "good mother of the Nemegt"), making reference to the then-recent discovery that oviraptorids <a href="brooded">brooded</a> eggs rather than stealing them, though no trace of a nest or eggs had yet been found associated with "Nemegtomaia" itself. The first known member of the oviraptorid family was found with a nest of eggs originally thought to have belonged to the <a href="ceratopsian">ceratopsian</a> genus "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>", and was therefore named "<a href="Oviraptor">Oviraptor</a>" in 1924; this name means "egg-seizer". In the 1990s more oviraptorid specimens were discovered associated with nests and eggs, wherein oviraptorid embryos were found, thereby proving that the eggs belonged to the oviraptorids themselves. "<a href="Ingenia">Ingenia</a>" was similarly renamed as "<a href="Ajancingenia">Ajancingenia</a>" in 2013, since the former genus name was preoccupied by a <a href="roundworm">roundworm</a> (Nematoda).

In 2007 two new specimens of "Nemegtomaia" were found by the "Dinosaurs of the Gobi" expedition, and were described by the Italian palaeontologist Federico Fanti and colleagues in 2013. The first specimen, MPC-D107/15, was found by Fanti (who nicknamed it "Mary") in the <a href="Baruungoyot%20Formation">Baruungoyot Formation</a>, and consists of a nest with the presumed parent on top. As the fourth genus of oviraptorid found on top of a nest (after "Oviraptor", "<a href="Citipati%20%28dinosaur%29">Citipati</a>", and <a href="cf.">cf.</a> "<a href="Machairasaurus">Machairasaurus</a>"), "Nemegtomaia" had therefore received a genus name referring to this feature before it was itself found associated with eggs. The specimen was excavated from a vertical cliff under "difficult circumstances", including heavy rain and collapsing <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> blocks. The skeleton preserves parts of the skull, both scapulae, the left arm and hand, the right humerus, the pubic bones, the ischia, the femora, the tibiae, fibulae, and the lower portions of both feet. This specimen was found less than 500 m (1640 ft) from the holotype, and was of the same size; it was assigned to "Nemegtomaia" due to its similar <a href="anatomical%20features">anatomical features</a> and geographical proximity. It was collected in a single block so that the spatial relationship of the bones and eggs would be preserved. The second specimen, MPC-D107/16, was found by the American palaeontologist Nicholas R. Longrich in the Nemegt Formation, and consists of the hands, a partial left ulna and radius, ribs, a partial pelvis, and both femora. This specimen was 35% smaller than the others, and was assigned to "Nemegtomaia" due to its hands having the same characteristics as those of specimen MPC-D107/15. It is possible that the hands may have belonged to a different individual, as they were not found articulated with the rest of the skeleton (other oviraptorids are known from quarries with multiple skeletons), but this cannot be confirmed.

In their 2004 <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a>, Lü and colleagues classified "Nemegtomaia" as a <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> (or "advanced") oviraptorosaur, and found it to be most closely related to the genus "Citipati". In 2010 Longrich and colleagues determined that "Nemegtomaia" belonged in the family <a href="Oviraptoridae">Oviraptoridae</a>, as part of the subfamily <a href="Ingeniinae">Ingeniinae</a>, making it the only member of the latter group with a prominent crest. Members of the other recognised subfamily, Oviraptorinae, all possess crests. Ingeniines are distinguished by smaller size, short and robust forelimbs with weakly curved claws, the number of vertebrae in the <a href="synsacrum">synsacrum</a>, as well as certain features of the feet and pelvis. Longrich and colleagues suggested that the presence of a crest on "Nemegtomaia" makes it possible that this feature evolved or disappeared several times among oviraptorids, or that the animal may not have been an ingeniine. In 2010, the American palaeontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> suggested that crestless oviraptorids were either the juveniles or females of otherwise crested species, and that the number of genera in the group was therefore exaggerated. He listed "Nemegtomaia" as ""Citipati" (="Nemegtomaia") "barsboldi", considering it very similar to that genus, but in 2016, he instead listed it as ""<a href="Conchoraptor">Conchoraptor</a>" (="Nemegtomaia") "barsboldi"".

In 2012 Fanti and colleagues also found "Nemegtomaia" to be part of Ingeniinae (as a derived member, closest to "<a href="Heyuannia">Heyuannia</a>"), due to the proportions of the hands of the two new specimens (relatively short with a robust first finger). They stated that, though the presence of crests is generally associated with oviraptorines rather than ingeniines, the feature may be correlated with size and maturity. They pointed out that the nasal and frontal bones of the ingeniine "Conchoraptor" were pneumatic and could potentially have grown into a crest as the animal matured, though all known skeletons of that genus are of the same small size (and one specimen appears to have been fully grown). The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below shows the placement of "Nemegtomaia" within Oviraptoridae, according to Fanti etal., 2012:

The <a href="clade">clade</a> Oviraptorosauria is generally regarded as a group of non-<a href="bird">avian</a> (or non-bird) <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family <a href="Caenagnathidae">Caenagnathidae</a> have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have gone so far as to consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed "Nemegtomaia" to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as <a href="dromaeosaurs">dromaeosaurs</a>. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were <a href="flightless%20birds">flightless birds</a> rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and <a href="troodontids">troodontids</a> to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group <a href="Paraves">Paraves</a>; oviraptorosaurs, <a href="therizinosaurs">therizinosaurs</a>, and <a href="alvarezsaurs">alvarezsaurs</a> are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called <a href="Pennaraptora">Pennaraptora</a>, and this group is defined by the presence of <a href="pennaceous%20feathers">pennaceous feathers</a> (feathers with a stalk).

Oviraptorosaurs are known from Asia (where they may have originated) and North America, and are mainly known from deposits that date from the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>-<a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> ages of the <a href="Cretaceous%20period">Cretaceous period</a>. The group includes small to large members, and they are characterised by their short skulls and beaks, elongated fingers, and short tails. <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">Basal</a> (or "primitive") members had teeth, which disappeared in derived members of the group (those within the superfamily <a href="Caenagnathoidea">Caenagnathoidea</a>, which includes Oviraptoridae). They were at least partially <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a>, and brooded their nests in a bird-like posture. Though they are all thought to have to been feathered, they appear to have been flightless. <a href="Skull">Cranial</a> crests appear to have <a href="evolved%20convergently">evolved convergently</a> in different <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a> within the group. The family Oviraptoridae (to which "Nemegtomaia" belongs) consisted of generally small members, and is exclusively known from the <a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a> of Asia, with most genera having been discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China. Including "Nemegtomaia", at least nine oviraptorid genera have been discovered in a relatively small geographical area in the Gobi Desert.

The "Nemegtomaia" specimen MPC-D 107/15 was found associated with a nest with eggs; its feet were placed in the centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the arms folded across the tops of the eggs on each side of the body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90 cm (35 in) wide and 100 cm (30 in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20 cm (8 in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5 mm (0.2 in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that the nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, <a href="sandstorms">sandstorms</a>, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.

Oviraptorid eggs appear to have been 17 cm (6 in) long on average, and the most complete eggs found with MPC-D107/15 are thought to have been 5to 6 cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14 to 16 cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The eggs are nearly identical to some that have previously been found in Mongolia, and have therefore been assigned to the <a href="oofamily">oofamily</a> (egg-taxon family) <a href="Elongatoolithidae">Elongatoolithidae</a>. The eggshells are relatively thin, between 1and 1.2 mm (0.03and 0.04in), and their outer surface is covered by ridges and nodes that rise about 0.3 mm (0.01 in) above the shell. The <a href="micro-structure">micro-structure</a> of the eggshells could not be properly studied, as the <a href="calcite">calcite</a> has been heavily altered and <a href="Recrystallization%20%28geology%29">re-crystallized</a>.

The nesting specimen was found in a <a href="stratigraphic">stratigraphic</a> area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise <a href="xeric">xeric</a> (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>, <a href="emu">emu</a>, and <a href="black-breasted%20buzzard">black-breasted buzzard</a>, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to <a href="heat%20stress">heat stress</a>. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it may be related to the presence of long <a href="wing%20feathers">wing feathers</a> that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping. 

In 2018, the Taiwanese palaeontologist Tzu-Ruei Yang and colleagues identified <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a> layers on egg-shells of maniraptoran dinosaurs, including oviraptorids. In modern birds, such layers (which consist mainly of <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s and <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a>) serve to protect the eggs from dehydration and invasion of <a href="microbes">microbes</a>. The researchers suggested that the cuticle-coated eggs would have been a trait adapted for enhancing their reproductive success in the variable environments where "Nemegtomaia" and other oviraptorids nested.

Various studies have suggested that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 the American palaeontologist David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern <a href="archosaurs">archosaurs</a> (birds and <a href="crocodilians">crocodilians</a>, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice <a href="polygamous">polygamous</a> mating and extensive male <a href="parental%20care">parental care</a> (as seen in <a href="paleognaths">paleognaths</a> such as ostriches and emus). This <a href="reproductive%20system">reproductive system</a> pre-dates the <a href="origin%20of%20birds">origin of birds</a> and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had <a href="pygostyles">pygostyles</a> on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; the American palaeontologist W. Scott Persons and colleagues suggested in 2013 that these could have been used for <a href="intraspecific%20communication">intraspecific communication</a> such as <a href="courtship%20rituals">courtship rituals</a>. 

The diet of oviraptorids has been interpreted in various ways since the time "Oviraptor" was wrongly thought to have been a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a> (stomach stones) found in "<a href="Caudipteryx">Caudipteryx</a>", and the wear facets in the teeth of "<a href="Incisivosaurus">Incisivosaurus</a>". In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous <a href="tetrapods">tetrapods</a> (four-limbed animals), especially those of <a href="dicynodonts">dicynodonts</a>, an extinct group of <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a> stem-<a href="mammals">mammals</a>. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> in the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as <a href="xerophytic">xerophytic</a> vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as little is known about the flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals. In 2017, the Canadian palaeontologist Gregory F. Funston and colleagues suggested that the parrot-like jaws of oviraptorids may indicate a <a href="frugivorous">frugivorous</a> diet that incorporated nuts and seeds.

In 1977 Barsbold suggested that oviraptorids <a href="molluscivore">fed on molluscs</a>, but Longrich and colleagues rejected the idea that they practised <a href="shell-crushing">shell-crushing</a> altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as <a href="bivalves">bivalves</a> or eggs. The symphyseal shelf at the front of the dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in <a href="sediments">sediments</a> that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.

Longrich and colleagues pointed out that the robust forelimbs and enlargement of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and <a href="pangolins">pangolins</a>, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being <a href="insectivorous">insectivorous</a>. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.

In 2004 Lü and colleagues proposed that the articulation between the <a href="Quadrate%20bone">quadrate</a> and <a href="quadratojugal%20bones">quadratojugal bones</a> in the skull of "Nemegtomaia" suggested that these bones were <a href="Cranial%20kinesis">movable in relation to each other</a>, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 the Belgian palaeontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that "Nemegtomaia" and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.

"Nemegtomaia" is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which date to the upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian ages of the Late Cretaceous period, about 70million years ago. Though this taxon is known only from the Nemegt locality, unidentified oviraptorid remains from other localities may belong to it. The Nemegt <a href="massif">massif</a> has numerous canyons or gorges, up to deep, which have some of the best exposures of these formations. The rock <a href="facies">facies</a> of the Nemegt Formation are thought to represent a humid, <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> (associated with rivers and streams) environment, whereas those of the Baruungoyot Formation are thought to represent an arid or semi-arid environment, with <a href="Aeolian%20processes">aeolian</a> (affected by wind) beds. These two formations with their diverse fossils were historically thought to represent sequential time periods with different environments, but in 2009 the Canadian palaeontologist DavidA. Eberth and colleagues found that there was partial overlap across the transition between them. The two formations "interfinger" across a stratigraphic interval that is about 25 m (82 ft) thick, which suggests that the fluvial and aeolian environments coexisted when the area was sedimented.

The environment of the Nemegt Formation has been compared to the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a> of present-day <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>. The habitats in and around the Nemegt rivers provided a home for a wide array of organisms. Aquatic animals include molluscs, fish, turtles, and the <a href="crocodylomorph">crocodylomorph</a> "<a href="Shamosuchus">Shamosuchus</a>". Fossils of <a href="mammals">mammals</a> such as <a href="multituberculates">multituberculates</a> have been found, and birds such as "<a href="Gurilynia">Gurilynia</a>", "<a href="Judinornis">Judinornis</a>", and "<a href="Teviornis">Teviornis</a>" are known. Herbivorous dinosaurs of the Nemegt Formation include <a href="ankylosaurid">ankylosaurid</a>s such as "<a href="Tarchia">Tarchia</a>", the <a href="pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosauria</a>n "<a href="Prenocephale">Prenocephale</a>", <a href="hadrosaurids">hadrosaurids</a> such as "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>" and "<a href="Barsboldia">Barsboldia</a>", and <a href="sauropods">sauropods</a> such as "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Opisthocoelicaudia">Opisthocoelicaudia</a>". Other theropods include <a href="tyrannosauroids">tyrannosauroids</a> such as "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>", "<a href="Alioramus">Alioramus</a>", and "<a href="Bagaraatan">Bagaraatan</a>", <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s such as "<a href="Borogovia">Borogovia</a>", "<a href="Tochisaurus">Tochisaurus</a>", and "<a href="Saurornithoides">Saurornithoides</a>", therizinosaurs such as "<a href="Therizinosaurus">Therizinosaurus</a>", and <a href="ornithomimosaurians">ornithomimosaurians</a> such as "<a href="Deinocheirus">Deinocheirus</a>", "<a href="Anserimimus">Anserimimus</a>", and "<a href="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a>".

Other oviraptorosaur genera known from the Nemegt Formation include the basal "<a href="Avimimus">Avimimus</a>", the oviraptorids "<a href="Rinchenia">Rinchenia</a>", "<a href="Nomingia">Nomingia</a>", and "Ajancingenia", and the caenagnathid "<a href="Elmisaurus">Elmisaurus</a>". In addition, "Conchoraptor" is known from the Baruungoyot Formation. In spite of the high number of oviraptorid taxa in these formations (the Nemegt has the highest known diversity of them anywhere), none of them were closely related. The Nemegt Formation is unique in having both oviraptorid and caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs, and in 1993 the Canadian palaeontologist <a href="Phillip%20J.%20Currie">Phillip J. Currie</a> and colleagues suggested this diversity was due to the two groups preferring different environments in the area. In 2016 the Japanese palaeontologist Takanobu Tsuihiji and colleagues suggested that oviraptorids may have preferred drier environments, while caenagnathids preferred fluvial environments, based on the type of formations they have been found in. Funston and colleagues suggested that oviraptorids were found in both xeric and <a href="mesic%20environments">mesic environments</a> (but were more abundant in the former), whereas the other oviraptorosaur groups avoided the xeric environments, and that the coexistence of the families can be explained by <a href="niche%20partitioning">niche partitioning</a> in diet. The environment of the Nemegt Formation may have acted as an <a href="oasis">oasis</a> and thereby attracted oviraptorids.

The nesting specimen MPC-D 107/15 has provided much information about the <a href="taphonomic%20processes">taphonomic processes</a> (changes during decay and fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that are thought to have been deposited through a sandstorm or <a href="dune">dune</a>-shift. It does not seem to have been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>.

Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of <a href="pupal%20chambers">pupal chambers</a>) in the specimen indicate it was <a href="scavenged">scavenged</a> upon by colonies of <a href="skin%20beetles">skin beetles</a> (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.

Fuck the Millennium

"Fuck the Millennium", sometimes spelled "***K the Millennium", is an <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> <a href="protest%20song">protest song</a> that was released as a single in 1997 by 2K (<a href="Bill%20Drummond">Bill Drummond</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a>, better known as <a href="The%20KLF">The KLF</a> and The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu). Based upon The KLF's <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> track "<a href="What%20Time%20Is%20Love%3F">What Time Is Love?</a>", it was promoted as a <a href="wiktionary%3Acomeback">comeback</a> single and released to mark the tenth anniversary of Drummond and Cauty's first collaborations; however, it was also in part intended to mock the notion of the comeback. It remains the only commercial release by the duo since <a href="The%20KLF%23Retirement">The KLF's 1992 retirement</a>. The single reached #28 in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> in October 1997.

Drummond and Cauty's campaign to "fuck the millennium" also involved an appearance by 2K at London's <a href="Barbican%20Arts%20Centre">Barbican Arts Centre</a> and a number of outlandish proposals to 'commemorate' the <a href="millennium">millennium</a> under the <a href="moniker">moniker</a> "K2 Plant Hire". These activities were intended to culminate in the construction of "The People's Pyramid", a -high structure built from recycled bricks, but the pyramid was never built.

From 1987 to 1992, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty released music under names including "The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu" ("The JAMs") and "The KLF". Following a run of five consecutive UK top-five singles, "The KLF" executed a high-profile retirement from the music business and deleted their entire back catalogue, declaring that "For the foreseeable future, there will be no further record releases from any past, present or future name attached to our activities." Drummond and Cauty's subsequent art project, the <a href="K%20Foundation">K Foundation</a>, disposed of "The KLF"'s earnings, including by <a href="Watch%20the%20K%20Foundation%20Burn%20a%20Million%20Quid">burning one million pounds</a> of it, money which was originally provisionally earmarked by the duo for millennial celebrations. Bill Drummond: "Originally we were going to invest the whole lot in some capital growth fund and spend it all on one big event, maybe at the millennium".

In the four years following "The KLF"'s retirement, Drummond and Cauty's musical output consisted only of a limited edition single released in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a> ("<a href="K%20Cera%20Cera">K Cera Cera</a>"), and a contribution to "<a href="The%20Help%20Album">The Help Album</a>" ("<a href="The%20Magnificent%20%28song%29">The Magnificent</a>").

In 1997, British artist <a href="Jeremy%20Deller">Jeremy Deller</a> pioneered the <a href="Acid%20Brass">Acid Brass</a> concept, collaborating with the <a href="Fairey%20Band">Williams Fairey Brass Band</a> to interpret and perform classic acid house tracks as <a href="brass%20band">brass</a> <a href="arrangement%20%28music%29">arrangements</a>. Deller was described by one source as a prankster, a notion frequently applied to Drummond and Cauty themselves. In February 1997, Drummond was contacted by his former <a href="Big%20in%20Japan%20%28band%29">Big in Japan</a> bandmate <a href="Jayne%20Casey">Jayne Casey</a>, who was helping to organise an arts festival in Liverpool and had noticed that Acid Brass' repertoire included "The KLF"'s "<a href="What%20Time%20Is%20Love%3F">What Time Is Love?</a>". Drummond attended the festival performance and heard "What Time Is Love?" performed as the encore, during which he telephoned Cauty. Cauty and Drummond together attended a 19 April Acid Brass performance at the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hall">Queen Elizabeth Hall</a>, <a href="London">London</a>. Collaborative work ensued between Drummond, Cauty, and Deller, in which the Acid Brass rendition of their track was incorporated into a composition designed to mark the tenth anniversary of Drummond and Cauty's first work.

A comeback of "The KLF" was implied by two black-and-white full-page adverts placed in the 21 August 1997 issue of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>". The first proclaimed "They're Back. The Creators of Trance. The Lords of Ambient. The Kings of Stadium House. The Godfathers of Techno Metal. The Greatest Rave Band In The World. Ever! 2K. For <a href="23%20%28numerology%29">23 minutes</a> Only". The second stated "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album "<a href="1987%20%28What%20the%20Fuck%20Is%20Going%20On%3F%29">1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)</a>". It continued, "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed". "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" looked forward to the event, saying that "It was just a matter of time before Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond hatched another prank and put a grin back on the face of pop music." "You just ache for them to be No. 1 again...", they said, but "One hopes they are not about to shoot themselves in the foot" because "the idea walks the tightrope between lunacy and brilliance... the pop world's countdown to the millennium surely starts here".

"1997 (What The Fuck's Going On?)" was performed by 2K as a one-off event at London's <a href="Barbican%20Arts%20Centre">Barbican Arts Centre</a> on 17 September 1997 with Acid Brass, the <a href="Liverpool%20dockers%27%20strike%20%281995%E2%80%9398%29">Liverpool Dockers</a>, <a href="Regia%20Anglorum">Regia Anglorum</a>, and Drummond's creative associates <a href="Mark%20Manning">Mark Manning</a> and <a href="Alan%20Goodrick%20%28Gimpo%29">Gimpo</a>, who appeared, respectively, as "an axe-wielding "<a href="evangelism">salvationist</a>" in a vicar's collar and gold lame suit, and a <a href="union%20steward">shop steward</a> character in a white coat with a megaphone". The performance began with a screening of "This Brick", a short 35mm film of a <a href="brick">brick</a> made from the ashes of the K Foundation's million-pound bonfire. Following an introduction by <a href="Factory%20Records">Factory Records</a> founder <a href="Tony%20Wilson">Tony Wilson</a>, Drummond and Cauty were then unveiled as pyjama-clad, wheelchair-using <a href="pensioner">pensioner</a>s with grey hair and, strapped to their foreheads, prominent horns that had been used regularly in The KLF's promotional videos. Drummond was also seen plucking feathers from a dead swan. According to a press release issued by <a href="Mute%20Records">Mute</a>/<a href="Blast%20First">Blast First</a> (Acid Brass' and 2K's record label), "Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of <a href="Dettol">Dettol</a>, caused havoc in their motorised <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>s. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along." The duo wheeled around the stage to the sound of Acid Brass' "What Time Is Love?". They were supported variously by a male choir's rendition of "K Cera Cera", joined by opera singer <a href="Sally%20Bradshaw">Sally Bradshaw</a>; the Viking Society in costume as <a href="Lifeboat%20%28rescue%29">lifeboatmen</a>; and the politically topical <a href="Liverpool%20dockers%27%20strike%20%281995%E2%80%9398%29">Liverpool Dockers</a> chanting "Fuck the Millennium". Following the performance, every audience member received a "Fuck the Millennium" T-shirt, poster, and bumper sticker in a carrier bag.

In a comprehensive assessment, "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" rationalised the spectacle: "They did what they always do: too many things at the same time. Their points are lost along with the plot. So, just to explain: ... Bill and Jimmy were dressed as old men as a comment on elderly pop groups making a comeback. The brass band playing house music tunes was organised by Jeremy Deller as a comment on <a href="working%20class%20culture">class culture</a> (<a href="working%20class">working-class</a> band playing working-class music). The dockers were asked along because their cause is important." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called the performance "a glorious, jaw-dropping mess", and "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"
commented that "the strongest point in its favour was its brevity". "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>" said, "There was no press furore the next morning—merely the anticlimactic aftertaste left by 40-year-old men miming to a seven-year-old song... 2K was unquestionably a failure."

A single, "Fuck the Millennium" was subsequently released, a studio-based recording falsely promoted as an edited version of the Barbican performance. Comparing the single with the live performance, "The Times" said that "On CD, things become more orthodox, though no less entertaining, comprising an acid brass version of their classic, What Time Is Love? and a young man shouting rude words."

The unedited studio recording of "Fuck the Millennium" is a 14-minute composition, a protest song based around The KLF's <a href="house%20music">house music</a> track "<a href="What%20Time%20Is%20Love%3F">What Time Is Love?</a>", drawing additionally on musical refrains and concepts from throughout Drummond and Cauty's canon. The track contains three main <a href="segue">segue</a>d parts: a house section led by the <a href="brass%20band">brass band</a> <a href="Acid%20Brass">Acid Brass</a>, a choral rendition of the English <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "<a href="Eternal%20Father%2C%20Strong%20to%20Save">Eternal Father, Strong to Save</a>", and a rhythmically hardened remix of "What Time Is Love? (Pure Trance Original)". The lead vocals before and after the hymn consist mainly of angry chants, with hundreds of instances of the word "<a href="fuck">fuck</a>". Apart from a small number of <a href="chord%20change">chord change</a>s during the segues, "Fuck the Millennium" contains no new music. However, the lyrics and brass arrangement are not found elsewhere in Drummond and Cauty's output.

The track is opened by <a href="Alan%20Goodrick">Gimpo</a> screaming "It's 1997: what the fuck is going on?". There follows a <a href="brass%20band">brass band</a> version of "What Time Is Love? (Pure Trance Original)", with a house rhythm added, along with <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> from The JAMs' 1987 recordings "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love%20%28The%20JAMs%20song%29">All You Need Is Love</a>", "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)", "<a href="Whitney%20Joins%20The%20JAMs">Whitney Joins The JAMs</a>" and "<a href="Burn%20the%20Bastards">Burn the Bastards</a>". Drummond leads a crowd of <a href="Liverpool%20dockers%27%20strike%20%281995%E2%80%9398%29">Liverpool Dockers</a> in angry chants: "Fuck the millennium! We want it now!".

Among the voices singing the three verses of the hymn are keyboardist Nick Coler, Drummond and Cauty, multiple recordings of whom are overlain to simulate a congregation. Mark Manning evangelically narrates its lyrics, and between verses, Gimpo screams for "Bill!" (Drummond) and "Jimmy!" (Cauty)—the only instance throughout their music that either of them is referred to without a pseudonym.

A "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>" journalist enthused about the track in the context of the duo's wider catalogue: "As soon as it starts you immediately remember the excitement that comes from hearing a KLF record for the first time. The original ambient house melody kicks in – and it hasn't dated a day. The chorus is given an extra kick by Acid Brass' massed ranks of horns and trumpets... It is quite brilliant."

Around the time of the single's release, further full-page adverts appeared in the national press, this time asking readers "***k The Millennium: Yes/No?", with a telephone number—the "Millennium Crisis Line"—provided for voting: "If you want to fuck the millennium, press '1'. If not, press '2'." The adverts were placed under the pseudonym K2 Plant Hire Ltd., who duly claimed that 18,436 (89%) of respondents wished to fuck the millennium. Thus, on 31 October 1997, K2 Plant Hire announced "The People's <a href="Pyramid">Pyramid</a>", an estimated -high structure built from as many <a href="brick">house bricks</a> as there were British 20th century births (estimated by the duo as 87 million), with no cost to the taxpayer. According to "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", a statement posted on K2 Plant Hire's website "pointedly contrast[ed] the intended virtues of their People's Pyramid with the drawbacks of the officially sponsored <a href="Millennium%20Dome">Millennium Dome</a>". "The Guardian" noted drily that the idea "would appear to be far-fetched even by their own standards" and "Planning permission might pose a problem." The Pyramid was never built.

K2 Plant Hire also contributed a short story, written by Drummond, to editor <a href="Sarah%20Champion%20%28journalist%29">Sarah Champion's</a> anthology "<a href="Disco%202000%20%28anthology%29">Disco 2000</a>". Entitled "'Let's Grind' or 'How K2 Plant Hire Went To Work'", the 1997 story is a fictional account of K2 Plant Hire's plan to demolish <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> on the <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">eve</a> of the millennium. Also in 1997, Drummond and Cauty reportedly used K2 Plant Hire's remaining funds to bid for purchase of the <a href="Rollright%20Stones">Rollright Stones</a> <a href="ancient%20monument">ancient monument</a>. <a href="Psychogeography">Psychogeographer</a> <a href="Stewart%20Home">Stewart Home</a> alleged that despite K2 Plant Hire's bid being the highest, the owners of the monument refused to trade with the duo.

Drummond and Cauty's works were both highly <a href="self-reference">self-referential</a> and rife with references to "<a href="The%20Illuminatus%21%20Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>" <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> novel, from which The JAMs took their name. Their last work, as 2K and K2 Plant Hire, continued many of these themes. Their <a href="Subversion%20%28politics%29">subversive</a> attitude was exhibited in their attempt to undermine the pop comeback. They defaced a wall of the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> the day after the Barbican performance: the <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> "1997: What the fuck's going on?" referenced their similar graffiti of ten years earlier on the same wall of the arts establishment. The unusual show at the Barbican was typical of their previous confusing and humorous costumed appearances; moreover, the horns strapped to their foreheads were previously used in The KLF's <a href="cowl">cowl</a> costumes. The <a href="advertising">advertising</a> campaigns before and after the single's release resumed Drummond and Cauty's characteristic promotional tactic of cryptic, monochrome full-page adverts placed in UK national newspapers and music press.

The duo's tenth anniversary was prominently implied by the adverts and graffiti, and "Fuck the Millennium" contains many samples from their earliest works. The KLF's "What Time Is Love?"—a breakthrough track for Drummond and Cauty on two occasions—is also used extensively: "Fuck the Millennium" contains the entirety of "<a href="What%20Time%20Is%20Love%3F">What Time Is Love? (Pure Trance Original)</a>", as well as samples used in "<a href="What%20Time%20Is%20Love%3F">What Time Is Love? (Live at Trancentral)</a>".

Seafaring was a recurring element of Drummond and Cauty's output, in lyrics from "<a href="Who%20Killed%20The%20JAMs%3F">Who Killed The JAMs?</a>", "<a href="The%20White%20Room">The White Room</a>" and "", and in imagery used to illustrate The KLF's retirement press notice. Prior to entering the music business, Drummond had worked as a <a href="fishing%20trawler">trawler</a>man. Samples of <a href="Evangelism">evangelists</a> also feature in several KLF Communications recordings: the album "<a href="Chill%20Out">Chill Out</a>" and the <a href="B-side">B-side</a>s "What Time Is Love? (Virtual Reality Mix)" and "America No More". "Fuck the Millennium" was a studio track promoted as a live recording and featuring sampled crowd noise, as were The KLF's self-named "<a href="Stadium%20House%20Trilogy">Stadium House Trilogy</a>" of singles. The use of an English hymn is central to The JAMs' "<a href="It%27s%20Grim%20up%20North">It's Grim up North</a>". All of The KLF's chart singles either refer or allude to <a href="time">time</a>, a theme continued by "Fuck the Millennium".

2K's lifespan was billed as the duration of the Barbican performance, <a href="23%20%28numerology%29">23</a> minutes. The number is given <a href="numerology">numerological</a> significance in "The Illuminatus! Trilogy". The "Fuck the Millennium" sleevenotes state that "The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu appear courtesy of The Five", a reference to the five Illuminati leaders of the novels. Drummond and Cauty took The JAMs' name from the fictional cult in "Illuminatus!", wherein the fictional JAMs are long-standing enemies of the Illuminati. K2 Plant Hire's "The People's Pyramid" recalled Drummond and Cauty's "Pyramid Blaster" logo (a <a href="ghetto%20blaster">ghetto blaster</a> suspended in front of a pyramid), itself a reference to the <a href="Eye%20of%20Providence">all-seeing eye</a> icon used in "<a href="Illuminatus%21">Illuminatus!</a>".

Although the references to "Illuminatus!" and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part intended to be a self-parodying dredge of The KLF's "myth". Drummond's opinions of the "<a href="rock%20%27n%27%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a> comeback" were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000: "The history of rock 'n' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks... No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and will never be the same as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub-cult... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature of the whole thing, the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth...".

Contemporary press reaction to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative. Since then, however, <a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a> have held up the Barbican show as the model of a pop performance. "At one unfortunately memorable <a href="Stereophonics">Stereophonics</a> gig ...", the paper said, "the extent of <a href="Richard%20Jones%20%28Stereophonics%29">Richard Jones</a>' showmanship was to play his bass while standing on a rug... this is hardly the pyjama-clad KLF, horns strapped to their heads, whizzing around the Barbican in wheelchairs with Zodiac Mindwarp in a pulpit and hundreds of sacked Liverpool dockers yelling "Fuck the millennium!" at the tops of their voices ..." Likewise, a 1999 feature on Drummond and Cauty in "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" reported their millennium activities with some warmth. "As a critique of the sponsor-saturated multi-million pound <a href="Millennium%20Dome">Millennium Dome</a>," the editorial ran, "the 'people's pyramid' is unsurpassed."

Recounting the exploits of 2K, and the press reaction, in his book "<a href="45%20%28book%29">45</a>" (published in the millennium year, 2000), Drummond said:
"Fuck the Millennium" was given an international single release on 13 October 1997. The record was not a success in comparison to The KLF's earlier chart-topping endeavours, peaking at a moderate #28 in the UK Singles Chart.

All formats contained at least one version of 2K's "Fuck the Millennium" and one of Acid Brass' "What Time Is Love?". The formats and track listings are tabulated below:

Super Columbine Massacre RPG!

Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> created by <a href="Danny%20Ledonne">Danny Ledonne</a> and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School shootings</a> near <a href="Littleton%2C%20Colorado">Littleton, Colorado</a>. Players assume the roles of gunmen <a href="Eric%20Harris%20and%20Dylan%20Klebold">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a> and act out the <a href="massacre">massacre</a>, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins on the day of the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in <a href="Hell%20in%20Christian%20beliefs">perdition</a>.

Ledonne had spent many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and programming knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. "Super Columbine Massacre" was created with <a href="ASCII%20%28company%29">ASCII</a>'s game development program <a href="RPG%20Maker%202000">RPG Maker 2000</a> and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an <a href="artist%27s%20statement">artist's statement</a> about the work after his identity was revealed. "Super Columbine Massacre" was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled hundreds of thousands of downloads.

Reaction to "Super Columbine Massacre" was negative; the title was criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. "Super Columbine Massacre"s themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 <a href="Dawson%20College%20shooting">Dawson College shooting</a>. The game has been described as an <a href="art%20game">art game</a>, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for <a href="video%20games%20as%20an%20art%20form">video games as an art form</a>, producing a documentary in 2008 called "<a href="Playing%20Columbine">Playing Columbine</a>" about his game and its impact.

"Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>. Players control the actions of teenagers <a href="Eric%20Harris%20and%20Dylan%20Klebold">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a>; the pair entered <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>'s <a href="Columbine%20High%20School">Columbine High School</a> on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game takes place in a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">third-person view</a>, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an <a href="Top-down%20perspective">overhead perspective</a>. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a>-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.

When players engage in battle, the screen changes to a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person view</a> of the enemy; enemies are named by stereotypes or occupations, such as "Preppy girl", "Janitor", "Math teacher" and "Jock Type". Combat has two options: "auto play", where the game chooses the weapon to use, or "manual play", in which the player decides to use a hand-to-hand weapon, explosive, gun, or defensive maneuver against foes. Once a battle starts, it is impossible to avoid or escape; the player must kill the enemy or die. Text narrates battle events and actions such as finding a bag or gaining a weapon.

As the game proceeds, <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives which may have caused them to commit murder; real life events are compressed into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they are believed to have occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.
The game begins as Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' basement to plot a series of bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.

In the next scene Harris and Klebold are standing outside their high school. The player guides them to the cafeteria to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop for a moment on a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.

The game's second half finds Klebold alone in Hell. After combating demons and monsters from the video game "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>", Klebold reunites with Harris, and they profess their enthusiasm for the opportunity to live out their favorite video game. The pair find themselves at the "Isle of Lost Souls", where they meet fictional characters such as <a href="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart Simpson</a>, <a href="Mega%20Man%20%28character%29">Mega Man</a>, <a href="Mario">Mario</a> and real personalities including <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, <a href="JonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey">JonBenét Ramsey</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, and <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>. Next, they deliver a copy of "<a href="Ecce%20Homo%20%28Nietzsche%29">Ecce Homo</a>" to <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> before fighting the "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" design of Satan. Upon their victory, Satan congratulates them for their deeds.

The game returns to Columbine High School, where a press conference addresses the murders. Some of the dialogue appears precisely as it was spoken after the actual event, while other lines caricature the political forces at work in the aftermath of the murders. The conference references gun control advocacy, religious fundamentalism, and the media's implication of <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> and video games as culpable in the shooting.

"Super Columbine Massacre" was created by <a href="Danny%20Ledonne">Danny Ledonne</a> of <a href="Alamosa%2C%20Colorado">Alamosa, Colorado</a>, then a student and independent filmmaker. As a high school student, the Columbine shootings resonated with Ledonne, who said that he himself had once been "a loner", "a misfit" and "a bullied kid" in high school like the shooters. "I was an easy target to be picked on, and that started in kindergarten", he said. "It was the kind of bullying that most kids who were bullied experienced [...] When you get pushed every day, and when you are ostracized not once, not twice, but years in and out, your perception of reality is distorted [...] These things really do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way", he said.

In 1999, director <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s death and the <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a> occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>", Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, he realized he was headed down the same path as the shooters. "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it was like I was looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself", Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from <a href="Alamosa%20High%20School">Alamosa High School</a>, Ledonne had a 4.0 <a href="grade%20point%20average">grade point average</a> and was voted "most likely to succeed" by his peers. He studied film at <a href="Emerson%20College">Emerson College</a> and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.

In November 2004, Ledonne discovered a program called <a href="RPG%20Maker">RPG Maker</a>, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker he was able to fulfill his ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.

The researching, planning, design and programming of the game took about six months and between 200 and 300 hours of work. All the footage and pictures in the game were taken from the internet. "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>" influenced the sprite-based design. Many of the songs in the game are MIDI versions of 1990s <a href="grunge">grunge</a> and alternative bands such as <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>, <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> and <a href="the%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">the Smashing Pumpkins</a>. Ledonne paid meticulous attention to detail, including giving players access to the exact inventory the gunmen used on their rampage. He watched videos, read newspaper articles and pored over 11,000 pages of documents released by the county government regarding the massacre and the killers.

Ledonne added elements to the game to criticize subjects varying from public reaction to the disaster, to stereotypical role-playing game conventions. Every victory in battle displays the message "another victory for the Trenchcoat Mafia", in reference to the gang that Harris and Klebold were mistakenly affiliated with by the media. Ledonne added the hell segment and populated it with characters from the video game "Doom", explaining that "[having the shooters] battle these monsters in an eternal recreation of their favorite videogame was a statement in and of itself." "Super Columbine Massacre" is the only video game Ledonne has created, and he has no future plans to create another.

The game was made available for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression he had something to hide. Under the alias "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, <a href="Rachel%20Scott">Rachel Scott</a>. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via PayPal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. "That's when I decided that I had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation", Ledonne said.

The game is distributed as <a href="freeware">freeware</a>, with donations in the amount of $1 requested to defray bandwidth costs. Initially, the game attracted little attention, and was downloaded 10,000 times in its first year. In April 2006 Patrick Dugan of web site <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> wrote about the game after meeting its host at <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>. Impressed, Dugan sent an email to <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> professor Ian Bogost, who blogged about the game. <a href="Brian%20Crecente">Brian Crecente</a> of gaming news site <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> and the "<a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20News">Rocky Mountain News</a>" subsequently interviewed Bogost, and the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> and mainstream media picked up the story. The increased visibility resulted in increased coverage, controversy, and downloads; in the first half of May 2006 the game was downloaded more than 30,000 times. Ledonne announced in September 2006 that the game was no longer available for download directly through its website (instead providing download links), as the title's popularity cost too much to sustain; in a single day in September, he reported 8,000 downloads. By March 2007, the game had been downloaded more than 400,000 times.

Reception of "Super Columbine Massacre" has been negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said "One of the girls who died [in the shootings] was a friend of mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.

"Super Columbine Massacre" was largely condemned by the press. <a href="Betty%20Nguyen">Betty Nguyen</a> of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> labeled the game as an example of a subculture that worships terrorists. Newspapers called the game "exploitive" and a "monstrosity". "<a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a>" declared the game #2 on its list of "The 10 Worst Games of All Time." Even critics who were supportive of Ledonne's intent found the game hard to play; Ben Kuchera of <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a> said that he left the game "shaken", but that as an easily misunderstood game "the people who are most likely to gain anything from it will never play it." Crecente felt that the message of the game was obscured by the cartoon graphics of the medium. Ledonne has refused to alter the game as it represents his thoughts on the subject at a particular point in time, but has encouraged others to rework the game themselves.

The most positive reviews of "Super Columbine Massacre" came from critics who accepted Ledonne's intended message. "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" magazine writer Clive Thompson appreciated the game's attention to narrative detail, writing that "the upshot [of the game] is that Ledonne has done a surprisingly good job of painting the emotional landscape of [the gunmen]—whipsawing from self-pity to pompous grandiosity and blinding rage, then back again." Thompson called the game subtle, including jabs at the participants and gaming culture by using the language of games as a way to think about the killings. Writing for "<a href="The%20Courier%20Mail">The Courier Mail</a>", Paul Syvret's advice to those who found the game controversial and in bad taste was to "lighten up". Bogost summed up his review of the game by writing "this game is not fun, it is challenging, and difficult to play—not technically difficult, but conceptually difficult. We need more of that." David Kociemba, a professor at Emerson College, agreed with Bogost and commented that "the controversy should be that there aren't more games like "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" that are as demanding and as artistically innovative." Dugan responded to common criticisms of the game, including that the game was made in bad taste, by writing a rebuttal on his blog:
I think everyone who disses the "Columbine RPG" is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis [sic], the honesty, the beauty of its social commentary. "Super Columbine Massacre RPG" is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless is a work of art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.

After the <a href="Dawson%20College%20shooting">Dawson College shooting</a> in September 2006, when gunman <a href="Kimveer%20Gill">Kimveer Gill</a> killed one student and injured 19 others, the "<a href="Toronto%20Sun">Toronto Sun</a>" wrote that Kimveer had self-reported playing "Columbine Massacre" on a web site. The story was picked up by media and reported widely. Upon hearing media reports of a link to the game one of the shooting victims at Dawson College contacted Ledonne and told him that "I just suffered multiple gunshot wounds and I think you should take this game down." Ledonne expressed his reaction to the shooting and renewed media attention towards his game in an interview a week later:
If one is interested in making something for the public to view—be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society? This is, in a sense, pre-crime. If you believe in what you're doing and you want to express yourself, the expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance to the creation of the work itself. On another level, the entire correlation between the Dawson College shooting and my game is unfounded. [...] What else did Kimveer like? Black clothes? Goth music? Pizza? [...] If anything, the Dawson College shooting is proof positive that games like ["Super Columbine Massacre"] "should" be made; until video games are no longer among the "usual suspects" for homicidal rampages, the public needs to more carefully consider why interactive electronic media is somehow the manufacturer of <a href="The%20Manchurian%20Candidate%20%281962%20film%29">Manchurian Candidates</a>.

Developer Ryan Lambourn created a <a href="flash%20game">flash game</a> called "<a href="V-Tech%20Rampage">V-Tech Rampage</a>" in 2007, which allows players to control the actions of gunman <a href="Seung-Hui%20Cho">Seung-Hui Cho</a> in the <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20massacre">Virginia Tech massacre</a>. Lambourn professed empathy for Cho, and said that he was a target of bullying in high school. "No one listens to you unless you've got something sensational to do. And that's why I feel sympathy for Cho Seung-Hui [sic]. He had to go that far", Lambourn stated. On the "V-Tech Rampage" site, Lambourn posted a statement that he would take the game off of <a href="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> if donations reached $1000; at $2000 in donations he would take the game down from the main site and for another $1000 he would apologize for creating it. Ledonne posted a comment on Lambourn's website after "V-Tech Rampage" drew comparisons to "Super Columbine Massacre", calling Lambourn's statement tantamount to a "hostage note", and asking bloggers to consider "not whether a game about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made but how we might go about making a game that accomplishes more than "V-Tech Rampage" does with the subject matter." Ledonne stated that he emailed Lambourn sympathetically, but that the creator responded to his emails with profanity; he reiterated that the two games had different motivations and were not easily comparable in content.

In October 2006, Sam Roberts, the Guerilla Gamemaker Competition director of the <a href="Slamdance%20Film%20Festival">Slamdance</a> festival, emailed Ledonne encouraging him to submit the game to the contest. Ledonne looked at the selection of the game as one of the competition's finalists in December as evidence that "all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration (even painful topics like school shootings)". The event's organizer, Peter Baxter, announced the removal of the game from the festival's "Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition" after its selection as a finalist. Several reasons for the change of mind were given, including threatened sponsor withdrawal, possible lawsuits, and "moral grounds"; Baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused the drop, instead affirming that "the shootings are still a very touchy subject, and rightly so. We have to be sensitive to [victims and their families'] feelings." An additional consideration reported was that unnamed parties might sue for copyright violations in the game itself. The announcement marked the first time the festival had pulled jury-selected content from the contest; the incident was dubbed "Slamgate" by the gaming press.
Following the announcement, <a href="USC%20Interactive%20Media%20Division">USC Interactive Media Division</a> withdrew its sponsorship of the festival. Seven of the fourteen finalist games were removed from the contest by their developers in protest: "<a href="Braid%20%28video%20game%29">Braid</a>", "<a href="flOw">flOw</a>", "Once Upon A Time", "Toblo", "<a href="Everyday%20Shooter">Everyday Shooter</a>", "Book and Volume" and "<a href="Castle%20Crashers">Castle Crashers</a>" ("Toblo" was later reinstated by the <a href="DigiPen%20Institute%20of%20Technology">DigiPen Institute of Technology</a>, who owns the rights to the game). Developer <a href="Jonathan%20Blow">Jonathan Blow</a> of "Braid" stated: "["Super Columbine Massacre"] lacks compassion, and I find the Artist's Statement disingenuous. But despite this, the game does have redeeming value. It does provoke important thoughts, and it does push the boundaries of what games are about. It is composed with more of an eye toward art than most games. Clearly, it belongs at the festival." Blow and the other developers sent an open letter to the festival, encouraging the reinstatement of the game as keeping with the festival's "trailblazing" efforts. Despite protests, Baxter refused to change his mind, citing consideration for the shooting's victims and their families. Ledonne told the other finalists that he planned to go to the festival anyway and distribute copies of the game. Acknowledging that the withdrawal of six finalists compromised the competition, Roberts let the attendees vote on whether any prizes would be awarded; they decided not to.

<a href="Brian%20Flemming">Brian Flemming</a>, director of "<a href="The%20God%20Who%20Wasn%27t%20There">The God Who Wasn't There</a>", saw Ledonne's demo of "Super Columbine Massacre" outside the festival, and convinced two fellow Slamdance film jurors to award the game a "Special Jury Prize" for Best Documentary, an unofficial award not endorsed by Slamdance itself. The jurors intended to present the special prize alongside the award for best documentary. Shortly before the ceremony, Baxter informed Flemming that he could not present the award due to "music clearance issues", and refused to allow it despite Flemming's protests. According to Ledonne, Flemming tried to hold his ground, but eventually gave in to Baxter's request.

Ledonne produced a <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> based on his experiences after the release of "Super Columbine Massacre". Titled "<a href="Playing%20Columbine">Playing Columbine</a>", the documentary uses the controversy surrounding the game to investigate the large issues facing video games as a medium for artistic expression. The film premiered at <a href="AFI%20Fest">AFI Fest</a> in Los Angeles, California on November 7, 2008.

As a result of the controversy of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games. Keith Stuart of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, "Super Columbine Massacre" "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'" Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as "Super Columbine Massacre" and the "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>" "<a href="Hot%20coffee%20mod">Hot coffee mod</a>" evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations. The game and others like it continue to be at the center of the video games as art debate, and Gamasutra credited "Super Columbine Massacre" and Slamgate as having two highly positive and far-reaching effects; first, forcing print game journalism to focus on the issue; and second, the "evangelization of the notion that games can be as meaningful and important as other media, even if the example is offensive to the sensibilities of most Americans [...] To win is to lose, but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored."

Russian battleship Slava

Slava ( "Glory") was a <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>, the last of the five s. Commissioned too late to participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, she survived while all of her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s were either sunk during the battle or surrendered to the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>.

Serving in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "Slava" was the largest ship of the Russian Gulf of Riga Squadron that fought the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">German High Seas Fleet</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915. She repeatedly bombarded German positions and troops for the rest of 1915 and during 1916. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moon%20Sound">Battle of Moon Sound</a> in 1917, "Slava" was badly damaged by the German <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> , significantly increasing her draft. The shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> in the Moon Sound Strait between the island of <a href="Muhu">Muhu</a> (Moon) and the mainland. The Estonians <a href="scrapped">scrapped</a> her during the 1930s.

"Slava" was <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a> and long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of , more than designed. Her normal displacement was , almost more than her designed displacement of .

The ship was powered by two 4-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple expansion steam engines</a>, each driving one 4-bladed <a href="propeller">propeller</a>, with twenty Belleville <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s providing steam to the engines at a pressure of . The engines and boilers were both built by the <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Works</a>. The engines had a total designed output of , but they produced on trials and gave a top speed of . At full load she carried of coal that provided her a range of at a speed of . She had four steam-driven <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s, each with a capacity of 150 kW, and two auxiliary generators with a capacity of 64 kW each.

"Slava"s 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="12%20inch%2040%20caliber%20naval%20gun">12-inch</a> guns were mounted in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one each fore and aft. They had a rate of fire of about one round per minute. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The twelve 45-caliber <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets carried on the sides of the ship. They had a practical rate of fire of about three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun. Four of the twenty <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> guns used against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s just below the forward main gun turret, two on each side. These guns were placed well above the waterline for use in any weather, unlike the remaining sixteen guns, which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over the length of the ship, close to the water. This was graphically demonstrated when "Slava"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> made a high-speed turn during her trials, <a href="Sailing%23Heeling">heeling</a> 15°, and began taking water through the lower casemates. Each gun had 300 rounds available. All but four of her <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s were removed before she was completed and the remaining guns were used as <a href="gun%20salute">saluting guns</a>. She carried four <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one above water in the bow and one in the stern with two <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es each, and a submerged tube on each side forward with three torpedoes each. Two of these were removed before 1914, although it is not known which ones were retained.

She was reportedly fitted with two 47 mm <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) guns during the war, but carried only four AA guns in early 1917. Her light armament had been reduced to twelve 75 mm guns by that same date. While she was laid up over the winter of 1916 at <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, the elevation of her main guns was increased to a maximum of 25° which increased their range to .

"Slava" was built by the <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Works</a> at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. She was laid down on 1 November 1902, launched on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late to participate in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>. Together with the battleship , she helped to suppress the <a href="Sveaborg%20Rebellion">Sveaborg Rebellion</a> in 1906. "Slava" was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-<a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima</a> naval reforms. On one of her training cruises to the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, her crewmen rescued survivors during the <a href="1908%20Messina%20earthquake">1908 Messina earthquake</a> and the ship took casualties to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> for medical care. She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by "Tsesarevich" to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> for temporary repairs before sailing to <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> for repairs that required nearly a year to complete. Upon her return to <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>.

The Baltic Fleet only had four pre-dreadnoughts in service, as the Second Brigade of Battleships, when World War I began, although the four <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s of the were almost finished. After they were completed and could defend the mouth of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>, "Slava" sailed through the <a href="Irbe%20Strait">Irbe Strait</a> on 31 July 1915 to assist Russian forces defending the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>. More specifically she was to support the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> with her guns and to defend the gulf against <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> naval forces.

Barely a week later, on 8 August, the Germans began to sweep the <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> defending the Irbe Strait, and "Slava", accompanied by the gunboats and , <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d to fire on the <a href="minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweeper</a>s. The German pre-dreadnoughts and attempted to drive the Russians off, but "Slava" remained in position despite sustaining splinter damage from near misses. She did not open fire, as her captain did not want to reveal the fact that she was out-ranged by the German battleships. The Germans were not prepared for the number of mines laid by the Russians and withdrew to reconsider their plans.

They tried again on 16 August, this time with the dreadnoughts and defending the minesweepers. "Slava" flooded her side compartments to give herself a 3° <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> which increased her maximum range to about . She did not engage the German battleships, but only fired on the minesweepers and any German ships such as the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> when they approached the other Russian ships. When the Germans returned the next day "Slava" was hit three times by shells in quick succession. The first hit penetrated her upper belt armor and exploded in a <a href="coal%20bunker">coal bunker</a>; the second hit penetrated her upper deck, hit the supporting tube of the aft port side six-inch turret and started a fire in the ammunition hoist which caused the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> to be flooded. The third shell passed through a pair of the ship's boats, but exploded in the water off to one side. These hits did not seriously damage "Slava" and she remained in place until ordered to retreat. The Germans entered the Gulf the next day, but they were forced to withdraw shortly afterward when the British <a href="submarine">submarine</a> torpedoed the battlecruiser on 19 August and the Russian <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> that still commanded the Irbe Strait made it very risky to enter the Gulf of Riga.

The German withdrawal allowed "Slava", after repairs, to switch to her other task and support the army with gunfire. During one of these missions, as she was bombarding German positions near <a href="Tukums">Tukums</a> on 25 September 1915, she was hit in the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> while at anchor, killing her captain and five others. McLaughlin attributes the hit to German <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>, but Nekrasov quotes German accounts that attribute it to a bomb dropped by one of a pair of German seaplanes. "Slava" remained in position and resumed her bombardment. She continued to support the Army until the water in the Gulf of Riga threatened to freeze over at which time she retired to the port of <a href="Kuivastu">Kuivastu</a> to winter over. While still in port she was hit by three light bombs dropped by a seaplane on 12 April 1916; these did little material damage, but killed seven sailors. On 2 July she resumed her support of the army with a bombardment of advancing German troops despite sustaining one hit by an shell on her waterline armor that caused no damage. She repeated these missions a number of times in July and August. These annoyed the Germans enough that they attempted to sink "Slava" with a coordinated ambush by the submarine and low-flying <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s as she responded to a feint by German cruisers on 12 September, but all their torpedoes missed. This was the first attack by torpedo bombers against a moving battleship.

"Slava" was held back during the initial stages of the German landings (<a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>) on <a href="Saaremaa">Saaremaa</a> (Oesel) Island guarding the mouth of the Gulf of Riga in October 1917 to defend Kassar Wiek (Inlet), which separates the outer islands of Saaremaa and <a href="Hiiumaa">Hiiumaa</a> (Dagö). She intermittently fired at German <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s as they fought Russian light forces in Kassar Wiek on 15 and 16 October, but scored no hits from her position near <a href="Kesselaid">Kesselaid</a> (Schildau) Island in Moon Sound Strait. On the morning of 17 October the Germans attempted to sweep the Russian mines placed at the southern entrance to Moon Sound Strait. "Slava", the pre-dreadnought and the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> were ordered south to meet them by <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Mikhail%20Bakhirev">Mikhail Bakhirev</a>, opening fire on the minesweepers at 8:05 a.m. The dreadnoughts and were to provide cover for the minesweepers, but "Slava", sailing further south, opened fire on them at 8:12 at nearly her maximum range. "Grazhdanin", whose turrets had not been modified for extra elevation, remained behind with "Bayan" and continued to engage the minesweepers. The German ships returned fire, but their shells fell short at a range of . "Slava" continued to fire on the Germans, but scored no hits, although some shells impacted only from "König". The German ships were at a severe disadvantage as they were sailing in a narrow swept channel and could not maneuver, so they reversed course to get out of range.

The German minesweepers made good progress, despite minor damage from shell splinters and numerous near misses by "Slava", "Grazhdanin", "Bayan", and the Russian shore batteries. During this period "Slava"s front turret became inoperable when a <a href="bronze">bronze</a> <a href="rack%20and%20pinion">rack and pinion</a> gear bent so that the gear wheel could not be moved. Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown. "Slava" and her consorts were ordered north to allow the crews to eat lunch, but returned to the fray and opened fire on the minesweepers again at 10:04 with her rear turret at an approximate range of . The minesweepers had cleared a channel to the north while the Russians were eating and the dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage the Russian pre-dreadnoughts. "König" opened fire on "Slava" at 10:14 and hit her with three shells from her third salvo. The first hit "Slava"s bow, below the waterline, and exploded in the bow dynamo room, flooding that room, the forward 12-inch magazine and other bow compartments, while the second penetrated the <a href="Capstan%20%28nautical%29">capstan</a> flat. The ship took on of water which gave her a list of 8°, later reduced to 4° by counter-flooding. This also increased her forward draft to about . The third shell hit the port side armor abreast the engine room, but failed to penetrate. Two more shells struck her at 10:24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel. They damaged a six-inch magazine and the forward stokehold (boiler room) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes. However, the forward left six-inch magazine was flooded as a precaution. At 10:39 two more shells hit her, killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker. Around this time "Slava" and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while "Bayan" trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships.

"Slava"s draft had increased too much to allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and <a href="Vormsi">Vormsi</a> (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a <a href="shoal">shoal</a> southeast of the channel because there was no one to obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and "Slava" settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>ns.

Japanese battleship Asahi

Reclassified as a <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a> in 1921, "Asahi" was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, after which she served as a <a href="training%20ship">training</a> and <a href="submarine%20depot%20ship">submarine depot ship</a>. She was modified into a submarine <a href="marine%20salvage">salvage</a> and rescue ship before being placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> in 1928. "Asahi" was recommissioned in late 1937, after the start of the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, and used to transport Japanese troops. In 1938, she was converted into a <a href="repair%20ship">repair ship</a> and based first at Japanese-occupied <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, China, and then <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a>, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, from late 1938 to 1941. The ship was transferred to occupied <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in early 1942 to repair a damaged <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and ordered to return home in May. She was sunk en route by the American submarine , although most of her crew survived.

Combat experience in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a> naval philosophy, which emphasized <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships. Therefore, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up in early 1896, to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations, with the construction of six battleships and six <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>s at its core. These ships were paid for from the £30,000,000 <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a> paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. As with the earlier and es, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. "Asahi", the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain, was ordered from the <a href="Clydebank%20Engineering%20%26amp%3B%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Company</a> shipyard in <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a>, Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme.

"Asahi"s design was a modified version of the s of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, with two additional guns. The ship had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She displaced at normal load. "Asahi" had a complete double bottom with 55 watertight compartments. Her hull was also subdivided into 223 watertight compartments. She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about 773 officers and enlisted men, including the admiral's staff.

The ship was powered by two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a> built by <a href="Humphrys%2C%20Tennant">Humphrys, Tennant</a>, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s at a working pressure of . The engines were rated at , using <a href="forced%20draught">forced draught</a>, and designed to reach a top speed of although "Asahi" reached from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 23 March 1900. She carried a maximum of of coal which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . The ship was fitted with three steam-driven <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s.

"Asahi"s <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of the same four <a href="Elswick%20Ordnance%20Company">Elswick Ordnance Company</a> 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth%2012%20inch%20naval%20gun">twelve-inch guns</a> used in all of Japan's preceding battleships. They were mounted in twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. The hydraulically powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse, at a fixed elevation of +13.5°. Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of .

The ship's <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of fourteen 40-calibre <a href="QF%206%20inch%20/40%20naval%20gun"></a> <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) guns</a> mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Protection against torpedo-boat attacks was provided by twenty <a href="QF%2012-pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun">QF 12-pounder 12 cwt</a> guns. The 12-pounders fired , projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Lighter guns consisted of eight <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss">three-pounder Hotchkiss guns</a> and four 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s. The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting tops</a>. The three-pounder gun fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , while the 2.5-pounder fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . The ship was also equipped with four submerged <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch</a> <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.

The <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armor%20belt">main belt</a> of "Asahi" consisted of <a href="Harvey%20armour">Harvey armour</a> high, of which was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of for the middle of the ship. It was only thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch <a href="strake">strake</a> of armour that ran between the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. The barbettes were thick, but only behind the upper armour strake. The barbette hoods were protected by 10 inches of armour on their face while their sides were 6 inches thick and the roof was thick. Diagonal <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s connecting the barbettes to the side armour were 12–14 inches thick, but only 6 inches thick at the lower deck level. The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also 6 inches thick with the rear protected by armour plates. The flat portion of the <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armour was thick and thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected by 14 inches of armour.

"Asahi", like all the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four <a href="Barr%20and%20Stroud">Barr and Stroud</a> FA3 <a href="coincidence%20rangefinder">coincidence rangefinder</a>s that had an effective range of . The ships were also fitted with 24-power <a href="magnification">magnification</a> telescopic <a href="gunsight">gunsight</a>s.

"Asahi", meaning "rising sun", a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29">waka</a> poetry, was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> on 1 August 1898 in <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a>, Scotland, by the Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and completed by <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Company</a>, which purchased the firm before "Asahi" was completed. She was <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900. Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running <a href="aground">aground</a> off <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a> following sea trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, on the day of her completion, and arrived at <a href="Yokosuka%2C%20Kanagawa">Yokosuka</a>, Japan, on 23 October 1900. "Asahi" became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> when the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> was re-formed on 28 December 1903.

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, "Asahi", commanded by <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> Hikohachi Yamada, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the <a href="Pacific%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">Pacific Squadron</a> anchored just outside <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a>. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17, while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. "Asahi" was not hit during the engagement.

The ship participated in the action of 13 April, when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Stepan%20Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a>'s <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and "Petropavlovsk" struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, Tōgō resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two Japanese battleships the following month.

During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, "Asahi", now commanded by Captain Tsunaakira Nomoto, was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships, behind "Mikasa", and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single 12-inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft 12-inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> of "Tsesarevich", killing the Russian squadron commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a>, two of his staff officers and the ship's <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>. The ship's wheel was jammed to <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">port</a> by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second-in-command, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Prince <a href="Pavel%20Ukhtomsky">Pavel Ukhtomsky</a>, eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur. Slightly more than two months later, on 26 October, "Asahi" struck a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> off Port Arthur while on <a href="blockade">blockade</a> duty. Severely damaged, she was under repair at <a href="Sasebo%20Naval%20Arsenal">Sasebo Naval Arsenal</a> from November 1904 to April 1905. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> that did not arrive until May.

At the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, "Asahi" again followed the battleship into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons. "Mikasa" opened fire at the battleship , the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by "Asahi" and the armoured cruiser shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Zinovy%20Rozhestvensky">Zinovy Rozhestvensky</a>, knocked out her rear 12-inch gun turret, and jammed "Knyaz Suvorov"s steering so that she fell out of formation. The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on "Mikasa" during the early part of the battle and "Asahi" was not damaged during this time. Tōgō was able to <a href="Crossing%20the%20T">cross the T</a> of the Russian squadrons. "Knyaz Suvorov"s steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged. "Asahi" seems to have mostly engaged the battleships and in the late stages of the battle, although fired the shots that caused the "Borodino"s magazines to explode and sink her. "Asahi" fired more twelve-inch shells, 142, than any other ship during the battle. In total, the ship was hit six times during the battle, but none of them damaged her significantly. While "Asahi"s casualties are not precisely known, the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle. The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the IJN.

<a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Pakenham%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">W. C. Pakenham</a>, the Royal Navy's official military observer under the <a href="Anglo-Japanese%20Alliance">Anglo-Japanese Alliance</a>, took notes of the battle's progress from a deck chair on "Asahi"s exposed <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West.

In 1908, "Asahi" was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a> through Japanese waters during its round-the-globe voyage. The ship was assigned to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910–11. "Asahi" became a gunnery training ship in 1914, and was re-armed in 1917 with Japanese guns replacing her original British-made guns. The same year, she was assigned to the 5th Division of the <a href="Third%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">3rd Fleet</a>. In 1918, "Asahi" became flagship of her division and participated in the <a href="Japanese%20intervention%20in%20Siberia">Japanese intervention</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. She escorted troop convoys to the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> and was <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> at <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> from January to August 1918. "Asahi" was reclassified as a first-class coastal defence ship on 1 September 1921, and began disarmament in 1922 at Yokosuka in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 April 1923 and her disarmament was completed in July of that same year. Her displacement dropped to with the loss of her armour and guns, and her speed was limited to .

The navy decided to convert "Asahi" into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925. From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at <a href="Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal">Kure Naval Arsenal</a>. One of her two <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> was also removed, and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> submarine "0-1" (ex-). In May 1928, "Asahi" was fitted with a compressed-air <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> on her <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and successfully launched an <a href="Nakajima%20E2N">E2N1</a> Type 15 <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. On the completion of testing in 1928, "Asahi" was placed in reserve.

Reclassified as a repair ship on 16 August 1937, "Asahi" was taken out of reserve in November, after the <a href="Marco%20Polo%20Bridge%20Incident">Marco Polo Bridge Incident</a> that started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was used as a transport to land troops in an <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious landing</a> at <a href="Hangzhou%20Bay">Hangzhou Bay</a>. Afterwards she began conversion at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>, Japan, into a repair ship; this was completed on 18 December 1938. "Asahi" was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> on 29 December. In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940. She was transferred to Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941.

From 13 March 1942, "Asahi" was stationed at Singapore, and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser , which had been <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed by the submarine off <a href="Christmas%20Island">Christmas Island</a>. Departing Singapore for Kure on 22 May, escorted by the <a href="subchaser">subchaser</a> "CH-9", "Asahi" was sighted by the submarine on the night of 25/26 May 1942, southeast of <a href="Cape%20Padaran">Cape Padaran</a>, Indochina. Of "Salmon"s four torpedoes, two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces. At 01:03, moments after being hit, "Asahi" sank at . Sixteen men were killed in the attack; the ship's captain and 582 crewmen were rescued by "CH-9".

Banksia ericifolia

Banksia ericifolia, the heath-leaved <a href="banksia">banksia</a> (also known as the lantern banksia or heath banksia), is a <a href="species">species</a> of woody <a href="shrub">shrub</a> of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. It grows in two separate regions of Central and Northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> east of the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a>. Well known for its orange or red autumn <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, which contrast with its green fine-leaved heath-like foliage, it is a medium to large shrub that can reach high and wide, though is usually half that size. In exposed <a href="heathland">heathland</a>s and coastal areas it is more often .

"Banksia ericifolia" was one of the original "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species collected by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> around <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> in 1770 and was named by <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carl Linnaeus the Younger</a>, son of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, in 1782. A distinctive plant, it has split into two subspecies: "Banksia ericifolia" subspecies "ericifolia" of the Sydney region and "Banksia ericifolia" subspecies "macrantha" of the New South Wales <a href="Northern%20Rivers">Far North Coast</a> which was recognized in 1996.

"Banksia ericifolia" has been widely grown in Australian gardens on the east coast for many years, and is used to a limited extent in the cut flower industry. Compact dwarf <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s such as "Banksia" 'Little Eric' have become more popular in recent years with the trend toward smaller gardens.

"Banksia ericifolia" grows as a large shrub up to in height, though often smaller, around , in exposed places such as coastal or mountain heathlands. The grey-coloured bark is smooth and fairly thin with <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s; however it can thicken significantly with age. The <a href="Leaf%20shape">linear</a> dark green leaves are small and narrow, long and up to 1 mm wide, generally with two small teeth at the tips. The leaves are crowded and <a href="phyllotaxis">alternately arranged</a> on the branches. New growth generally occurs in summer and is an attractive lime green colour.

Flowering is in autumn, or in winter in cooler areas; the inflorescences are flower <a href="spike%20%28botany%29">spikes</a> high and broad or so. Each individual flower consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a> made up of four fused <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and one long wiry <a href="carpel">style</a>. Characteristic of the taxonomic section in which it is placed, the styles are hooked rather than straight. The styles' ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, when the flowers open. The spikes are red or gold in overall colour, with styles golden, orange, orange-red or <a href="Burgundy%20%28color%29">burgundy</a>. Some unusual forms have striking red styles on a whitish perianth. Very occasionally, forms with all yellow inflorescences are seen. Though not terminal, the flower spikes are fairly prominently displayed emerging from the foliage; they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes.

Old flower spikes fade to brown and then grey with age; old flower parts soon fall, revealing numerous small dark grey to dull black finely furred <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>. Oblong in shape and in diameter, the follicles are ridged on each valve and remain closed until burnt by fire. "Banksia ericifolia" responds to fire by seeding, the parent plant being killed. As plants take several years to flower in the wild, it is very sensitive to too-frequent burns and has been eliminated in some areas where these occur. With time and the production of more cones with seed-containing follicles, however, plants can store up to 16,500 seeds at eight years of age. Some plants produce multiple flower spikes, possibly of varying sizes, from a single point of origin.

"B. ericifolia" was first collected at <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> on 29 April 1770, by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Solander">Dr Daniel Solander</a>, naturalists on the "<a href="HM%20Bark%20Endeavour">Endeavour</a>" during Lieutenant (later Captain) <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s first voyage to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. However, the species was not published until April 1782, when <a href="Carolus%20Linnaeus%20the%20Younger">Carolus Linnaeus the Younger</a> <a href="species%20description">described</a> the first four "Banksia" species in his "<a href="Supplementum%20Plantarum">Supplementum Plantarum</a>". Linnaeus distinguished the species by their leaf shapes and named them accordingly. Thus the species with leaves reminiscent of <a href="Erica">heather</a> (at the time classified in the genus "<a href="Erica">Erica</a>") was given the specific name "ericaefolia", from the Latin "erica", meaning "heather", and "folium", meaning "leaf". This spelling was later adjusted to ""ericifolia""; thus the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">full name</a> for the species is "Banksia ericifolia" L.f., with the initials "<a href="List%20of%20botanists%20by%20author%20abbreviation%23L">L.f.</a>" identifying Carolus Linnaeus the Younger.

While many "Banksia" species have undergone much taxonomic change since publication, the distinctive "B. ericifolia" has remained largely unchanged as a species concept. Consequently, the species has no <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a>s; it does, however, have three <a href="nomenclatural%20synonym">nomenclatural synonym</a>s. The first synonym, "Banksia phylicaefolia" Salisb, was published by the English botanist <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Anthony Salisbury</a> in his 1796 "Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium". It was intended as a replacement name for "B. ericaefolia", but Salisbury gave no reason why such a replacement was necessary. The name was therefore superfluous, and hence <a href="Nomen%20illegitimum">illegitimate</a>. The second synonym arose from <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>'s 1891 challenge of the name "Banksia" L.f., on the grounds that "Banksia" J.R.Forst & G. Forst had been <a href="Homonym%20%28botany%29">published before it</a>, for the genus now known as "<a href="Pimelea">Pimelea</a>". Kuntze transferred all "Banksia" species to the new genus name "Sirmuellera", in the process publishing "Sirmuellera ericifolia" (L.f.) Kuntze. The challenge failed, however; indeed, his <a href="Revisio%20Generum%20Plantarum">entire treatise</a> was widely rejected. Finally, in 1905 <a href="James%20Britten">James Britten</a> mounted a similar challenge, proposing to transfer all "Banksia" species into "Isostylis"; "B. ericifolia" L.f. thus becoming "Isostylis ericifolia" L.f. (Britten). This challenge also failed.

A recent change to the species' taxonomy is the recognition, in 1981, of an <a href="infraspecific%20taxon">infraspecific taxon</a>. The existence of different forms of "B. ericifolia" was first recognised in 1979 by the amateur botanist Alf Salkin, who noted three distinct forms of the species, with one being a possible hybrid with "<a href="Banksia%20spinulosa%20var.%20cunninghamii">Banksia spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii</a>". Salkin gave his northern form the provisional infraspecific name "microphylla", but when <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> published a formal description in his 1981 "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>", he named it "B. ericifolia" var. "macrantha". In 1996, it was promoted to <a href="subspecies">subspecific</a> rank as <a href="Banksia%20ericifolia%20subsp.%20macrantha">"B. ericifolia" subsp. "macrantha"</a>.

"Banksia ericifolia" has traditionally been described as lying within <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Spicigerae">series "Spicigerae" of "Banksia"</a>, together with "<a href="Banksia%20spinulosa">Banksia spinulosa</a>" and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as "<a href="Banksia%20seminuda">B. seminuda</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20brownii">B. brownii</a>". This series is placed in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Oncostylis">"Banksia" sect. "Oncostylis"</a> according to <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a>'s <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">taxonomy of Banksia</a>, but directly into <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"Banksia" subg. "Banksia"</a> in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Thiele's arrangement</a> based on <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries "Ericifoliae", but this was not supported by George.

Under George's taxonomic arrangement of "Banksia", "B. ericifolia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement may be summarised as follows:

Molecular research by American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> suggests that "B. spinulosa" and "B. ericifolia" may be more closely related to <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Salicinae">"Banksia" ser. "Salicinae"</a>, with includes "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a>" and its relatives.

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia". They inferred a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> markedly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding "Banksia" to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> with respect to "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". A full new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Australian botanist <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> initiated a rearrangement by transferring "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and publishing "B." subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; in this way they also redefined the <a href="Autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subg. "Banksia"</a>. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. ericifolia" is placed in "B." subg. "Spathulatae".

Hybrids with "<a href="Banksia%20spinulosa%20var.%20spinulosa">B. spinulosa" var. "spinulosa</a>" have been recorded in the wild, at <a href="Pigeon%20House%20Mountain">Pigeon House Mountain</a> in Morton National Park. "Banksia" <a href="Banksia%20%27Giant%20Candles%27">'Giant Candles'</a> was a chance garden hybrid between "B. ericifolia" and "B. spinulosa" var. "cunninghamii".

Two geographically distinct forms are recognised:



In 1992, "B. ericifolia" was adopted as the official plant of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, and is sometimes seen in amenity plantings and parks around the city. It was known as wadanggari (pron. "wa-tang-gre") to the local <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> inhabitants of the Sydney basin.

In nature, the variety "ericifolia" is found on acidic <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based soils; either in elevated heathland within of the coast around the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> basin, from Collaroy south to <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>, or elevated sandstone soils in mountainous areas such as the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a> and the <a href="Budawangs">Budawangs</a>. These heathlands are often moist, with access to some form of underground water, and can even be quite swampy. It can form dense thickets with the Dagger Hakea ("<a href="Hakea%20teretifolia">Hakea teretifolia</a>") and Scrub She-oak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20distyla">Allocasuarina distyla</a>"). Other plants it associates with include the Coast Tea-tree ("<a href="Leptospermum%20laevigatum">Leptospermum laevigatum</a>") and smaller plants such as "<a href="Woollsia%20pungens">Woollsia pungens</a>". The inflorescences are a feature of autumn <a href="bushwalking">bushwalking</a> in sandstone areas, such as the <a href="Kings%20Tableland">Kings Tableland</a> walk in the Blue Mountains, Jennifer Street Boardwalk in <a href="Little%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Little Bay</a>, and <a href="Royal%20National%20Park">Royal National Park</a>.

The northern subspecies "macrantha" is found in two distinct regions on the far north coast of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>; the first from Crowdy Bay on the <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mid North Coast</a> northwards to <a href="Hat%20Head%20National%20Park">Hat Head National Park</a> north of <a href="Port%20Macquarie">Port Macquarie</a>, and then from <a href="Yuraygir%20National%20Park">Yuraygir National Park</a> north to <a href="Kingscliff%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kingscliff</a> just south of the <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> border. This variety is more strictly coastal with most populations being found within two kilometres of the coast, or in swampy areas. It may be associated with "<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">Banksia oblongifolia</a>".

Like other banksias, "B. ericifolia" plays host to a wide variety of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in <a href="Bundjalung%20National%20Park">Bundjalung National Park</a> in Northern New South Wales found that "B. ericifolia" inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small <a href="mammals">mammals</a>, including <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s such as "<a href="Antechinus%20flavipes">Antechinus flavipes</a>" (yellow-footed antechinus), and <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s such as "<a href="Rattus%20tunneyi">Rattus tunneyi</a>" (pale field rat) and "<a href="Melomys%20burtoni">Melomys burtoni</a>" (grassland mosaic-tailed rat). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. A 1978 study found "<a href="Rattus%20fuscipes">Rattus fuscipes</a>" (bush rat) to bear large amounts of pollen from "B. ericifolia" and suggested the hooked styles may play a role in pollination by mammals. Other visitors recorded include "<a href="Apis%20mellifera">Apis mellifera</a>" (European honeybee).

A great many bird species have been observed visiting this Banksia species. A 1985 study in the Sydney area of "B. ericifolia" var. "ericifolia" found numerous birds visiting the inflorescences, including the <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris nigra"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus lunatus"), <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus chrysops"), <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata") and <a href="little%20wattlebird">little wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera chrysoptera"), as well as the <a href="Silvereye">Silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis"). The <a href="beautiful%20firetail">beautiful firetail</a> ("Stagonopleura bella") also associates with this species. Some mammals were recorded in this study but were found to bear no pollen. Exclusion of certain pollinators showed that birds and insects were important for fertilisation. Additional species seen in "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" survey include <a href="white-eared%20honeyeater">white-eared honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus leucotis"), <a href="white-plumed%20honeyeater">white-plumed honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus penicillatus"), <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera"), <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a> ("Manorina melanocephala"), and species of <a href="friarbird">friarbird</a> for "B. ericifolia" var. "ericifolia" and <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="tawny-crowned%20honeyeater">tawny-crowned honeyeater</a> ("Gliciphila melanops") and <a href="black-faced%20cuckoo-shrike">black-faced cuckoo-shrike</a> ("Coracina novaehollandiae") for "B. ericifolia" var. "macrantha".

Insects recovered from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth ("<a href="Arotrophora%20canthelias">Arotrophora canthelias</a>"), younger <a href="instar">instar</a>s of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis as they get older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus "<a href="Cryptophasa">Cryptophasa</a>", as well as "<a href="Scieropepla%20rimata">Scieropepla rimata</a>", "<a href="Chalarotona%20intabescens">Chalarotona intabescens</a>" and "<a href="Chalarotona%20melipnoa">Chalarotona melipnoa</a>", "<a href="Brachmia%20trinervis">Brachmia trinervis</a>", "<a href="Carposina%20hyperlopha">Carposina hyperlopha</a>" and an unidentified weevil species.

Like most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, "B. ericifolia" has <a href="proteoid%20root">proteoid root</a>s—roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance <a href="solubility">solubilisation</a> of <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, allowing <a href="mineral%20uptake">nutrient uptake</a> in low-nutrient soils such as the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.

"Banksia ericifolia" depends on fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and eventually die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around six years to reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30 years. For a large part of its distribution "Banksia ericifolia" grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both <a href="arson">arson</a> and <a href="controlled%20burn">prescribed burns</a>, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.

"Banksia ericifolia" is listed in Part 1 Group 1 of Schedule 13 of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974"; this means that as a common and secure species it is exempted from any licensing or tagging requirements under the 2002–2005 management plan to minimise and regulate the use of protected and threatened plants in the cut-flower industry in New South Wales.

"Banksia ericifolia" was one of the first "Banksia" species to be cultivated, having been introduced into cultivation in England in 1788. By 1804, it had flowered in several collections. That year a painting of the plant by <a href="Sydenham%20Edwards">Sydenham Edwards</a> was featured in "<a href="Curtis%27s%20Botanical%20Magazine">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</a>", accompanied by text describing the species as "a handsome shrub [that] thrives freely".

"Banksia ericifolia" inflorescences attract a variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough to be used as a street plant in parts of Sydney, "B. ericifolia" is a fairly easy plant to grow in the conditions it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, "Banksia ericifolia" is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as <a href="chlorosis">chlorosis</a>, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high <a href="pH">pH</a>. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with <a href="iron%20chelate">iron chelate</a> or <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">sulfate</a>.

Flowering may take some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cutting</a>-grown plant. "Banksia ericifolia" can be propagated easily by seed, and is one of the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.

Regular <a href="pruning">pruning</a> is important to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, it does not have dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as "B. spinulosa" and "<a href="Banksia%20robur">B. robur</a>".

For many years the horticulture industry focussed on registered selections of "Banksia spinulosa", but since the late 1990s more and more cultivars of "Banksia ericifolia" have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6 metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that is right for their conditions and tastes. "Banksia ericifolia" is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not to the degree that the western Australian species such as "<a href="Banksia%20coccinea">B. coccinea</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>" are.

There are a number of commercial varieties available from Australian retail nurseries; however none have yet been registered under <a href="plant%20breeders%27%20rights">plant breeders' rights</a> legislation, and only one (<a href="Banksia%20%27Limelight%27">'Limelight'</a>) is registered with the <a href="Australian%20Cultivar%20Registration%20Authority">Australian Cultivar Registration Authority</a>. The lack of official names has led to some varieties bearing several different names.

Peresvet-class battleship

The "Peresvet" class was a group of three <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> around the end of the 19th century. and were transferred to the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Squadron</a> upon completion and based at <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> from 1901 and 1903, respectively. All three ships were lost by the Russians in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05; "Peresvet" and "Pobeda" participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battles of Port Arthur</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> and were sunk during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Siege of Port Arthur</a>. "Oslyabya", the third ship, sailed to the Far East with the <a href="Pacific%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">Second Pacific Squadron</a> to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur and was sunk at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> with the loss of over half her crew.

"Peresvet" and "Pobeda" were <a href="marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. "Peresvet" was sold back to the Russians during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, as the two countries were by now allies, and sank after hitting German <a href="naval%20mines">mines</a> in the Mediterranean in early 1917 while "Pobeda", renamed "Suwo", remained instead in Japanese service and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsingtao">Battle of Tsingtao</a> in late 1914. She became a gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> in 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> and probably <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> around that time.

After the humiliating Russian defeat during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> of 1854–55, <a href="General%20Admiral">General Admiral</a> <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Konstantin%20Nikolayevich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich</a> understood that Russia would never be able to outbuild Britain or France, but still needed a maritime strategy that could defend Russia, give the fleet a useful role in peacetime and act as a deterrent. He decided that a "<a href="guerre%20de%20course">guerre de course</a>" (commerce-raiding) strategy was Russia's only effective means of attacking the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> or France if war broke out and built a series of fast, long-range, <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s like and to implement his strategy. The British responded by building the second-class battleships of the to defeat the cruisers and the Russians countered with the three ships of the "Peresvet" class that were designed to support their armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.

As was common with Russian ships of the time, changes were made while the ships were under construction. The most important was the revision of the <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> from eight and five guns to eleven 6-inch guns and additional light guns. Only two ships were originally planned, but a third was ordered to keep the <a href="Baltic%20Yard">Baltic Works</a> shipyard busy until a new design could be prepared. Ironically, it was completed before the second ship, despite having been <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> over three years later.

The "Peresvet"-class ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . Designed to <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displace</a> , they were overweight and actually displaced . To reduce <a href="biofouling">biofouling</a>, the hulls of the first two ships were sheathed with wood and copper, but this was eliminated in "Pobeda" to reduce weight. The vessels had a partial <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> and the hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s; a centerline bulkhead divided the forward engine rooms. Each crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men.

The ships were powered by three <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, each driving one <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>, using steam generated by 30 <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s. The engines were rated at , using <a href="forced%20draught">forced draft</a>, and designed to reach a top speed of . All three ships slightly exceeded their specifications and reached top speeds of from during their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. They carried a maximum of of coal which allowed them to steam for at a speed of . Their electrical equipment consisted of four steam-driven <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s with a total capacity of .

The ships' <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of four 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a>, <a href="254mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201891"></a> guns mounted in electrically powered twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one forward and one aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. These guns had major development problems as they proved to be too weak to use a full-strength charge of propellant and had to be reworked and the charge reduced. The guns in "Peresvet" and "Oslyabya" were the original model and could be elevated to a maximum of +35°, while the reinforced guns used in "Pobeda" could only elevate to a maximum of +25°. The guns were designed to fire once every 40 seconds, but in service they fired at half that rate. The ships carried 75 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> for each gun. The older guns fired a shell at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of while "Pobeda"s newer ones may have reached a muzzle velocity of . At an elevation of +6°, the gun had a range of . The secondary armament of the "Peresvet"-class ships consisted of eleven <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">45-caliber, 6-inch</a> <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> Model 1891 <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) gun</a>s, 10 mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the sides of the hull and one underneath the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> as a <a href="bow%20chaser">bow chaser</a>. Each gun was provided with 220 rounds. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a range of when fired at an elevation of +20°.

Smaller guns were carried for close-range defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. These included 20 <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">Canet Model 1891</a> guns. Of these guns, eight were mounted in <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s in the hull, four on the main deck, four on the battery deck and the last four at the corners of the superstructure on the forecastle deck. The ships carried 300 rounds for each gun. The gun had a muzzle velocity of with its shells. It had a range of about at an elevation of +20°. The smaller guns included twenty QF <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s in hull embrasures and on the superstructure. Each gun had 810 rounds provided. They fired a shell. Eight Hotchkiss guns were positioned between the 47-millimeter guns on the forecastle deck. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

The "Peresvet" class had five <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three of which were above water, one in the bow and one pair of <a href="broadside">broadside</a> tubes, and two broadside underwater tubes. The ships carried a total of 12 torpedoes. They also carried 45 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be laid to protect their <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">anchorage</a> in remote areas.

The ships were fitted with Liuzhol <a href="Stadiametric%20rangefinding">stadiametric rangefinders</a> that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and the <a href="crow%27s%20nest">crow's nest</a>, to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and <a href="deflection%20%28ballistics%29">deflection</a> required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control transmission system</a> to each gun or turret. "Oslyabya" and the rest of the Second Pacific Squadron were also fitted with Perepelkin <a href="telescopic%20sight">telescopic sight</a>s for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.

The first two ships used <a href="Harvey%20armor">Harvey armor</a> for most of their armored vertical surfaces except for the gun turrets and their support tubes, which were made from <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. "Pobeda", however, used Krupp armor for all of her heavy vertical armor. Over the machinery spaces, the maximum thickness of their waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was which reduced to abreast the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s. The belt tapered to a thickness of over the machinery spaces and over the magazines. The belt covered of the ships' length and was high, of which the upper was intended to be above the waterline, but the ships were significantly overweight. So much of the belt was submerged that "Peresvet" only had of armor exposed at normal load; at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a> the effect was even greater and the belt was completely submerged. "Oslyabya" was even more overweight and only had of her belt armor showing at normal load. The belt in both ships terminated in 7-inch transverse bulkheads, leaving the ends of the ships unprotected. The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in "Pobeda" were eliminated as the belt was extended to the ends of the ship with 4-inch armor plates. Above the waterline belt in all three ships was a shorter <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor that protected the middle of the ships. It was long and 4 inches thick. The ends of the upper belt were closed off by 4-inch angled transverse bulkheads.

The sides of the gun turrets were 9 inches thick and of armor protected their roofs; their supporting tubes were thick. The face of the casemates for the 6-inch guns was five inches thick and their rears were protected by armor plates. The casemates at each end of the ships were protected by 5-inch transverse bulkheads. Bulkheads thick separated the 75-millimeter gun positions. "Peresvet" had two <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>s, each with sides 6 inches thick, but the other two ships only had a forward conning tower with 9-inch sides. A communications tube 3 inches thick connected each conning tower to the armored deck in all three ships. The flat part of the deck in the central <a href="armored%20citadel">armored citadel</a> consisted of a plate over the normal 0.75-inch structural steel deck plate; the sloped portion connected to the lower edge of the waterline belt and was 2.5 inches thick. Outside the citadel the armored deck consisted of plates laid over the deck plating. On the first two ships the deck armor consisted of <a href="mild%20steel">mild steel</a>; in "Pobeda" it was a chrome-nickel steel alloy.

"Peresvet", named after <a href="Alexander%20Peresvet">Alexander Peresvet</a>, a Russian <a href="monk">monk</a> who fought against the Golden Horde at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kulikovo">Battle of Kulikovo</a> in 1380, and "Pobeda" (the Russian word "pobeda" means "victory") steamed to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> almost immediately after entering service in 1901 and 1903 respectively. Upon her arrival, "Peresvet" became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the squadron's second-in-command, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Prince <a href="Pavel%20Ukhtomsky">Pavel Ukhtomsky</a>. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> (February 1904) on the second day of the war, "Peresvet" was not hit, but "Pobeda" was hit once <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded. "Pobeda" struck a mine during the squadron's <a href="sortie">sortie</a> on 13 April and remained under repair for almost two months. Both ships had some of their anti-torpedoboat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port. They participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a> on 10 August 1904; "Pobeda" was only lightly damaged by 11 large-caliber hits, but "Peresvet", hit 39 times, suffered a considerable amount of flooding. More guns were landed after the squadron's return to Port Arthur, but the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November, and this allowed Japanese <a href="siege%20gun">siege gun</a>s to fire directly at the Russian ships. "Pobeda" and "Peresvet" were hit many times, and "Pobeda" sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage. "Peresvet" was <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> in shallow water on the same day.
Construction of "Oslyabya", named after <a href="Oslyabya">Radion Oslyabya</a> (another monk who had fought at the Battle of Kulikovo), was greatly delayed, and the ship found herself "en route" to the Far East when the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904. She was ordered home and assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur. The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron <a href="Dmitry%20von%20F%C3%B6lkersam">Dmitry von Fölkersam</a>, second-in-command of the squadron, but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. "Oslyabya" led the Second <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during the early part of the battle. Many of the hits on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding. Efforts to counteract the resulting <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire - the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire. Sources differ on the exact number of casualties, but the lowest figure given is 471.

The Japanese raised, repaired, and rearmed "Peresvet" and "Pobeda". They incorporated the refurbished vessels into the Imperial Japanese Navy as "Sagami" and "Suwo", respectively, and reclassified them as first-class <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s. After the beginning of World War I in 1914, "Sagami" was sold to Russia in March 1916 and arrived in <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> on 3 April 1916, where she resumed her former name of "Peresvet". The Russian Navy intended the ship for service with the Russian Arctic flotilla, and "Peresvet" sailed for the Arctic, but struck two mines off <a href="Port%20Said%2C%20Egypt">Port Said, Egypt</a> on 4 January 1917. The mines, laid by the German submarine , sank "Peresvet" with the loss of 167 lives after she had caught fire.

Benjamin Franklin Tilley

Benjamin Franklin Tilley (March 29, 1848March 18, 1907), often known as B. F. Tilley, was a career officer in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> who served from the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> through the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. He is best remembered as the first <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20American%20Samoa">Acting-Governor of American Samoa</a> as well as the territory's first Naval governor.

Tilley entered the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> during the height of the Civil War, graduating after the conflict. He gradually rose through the ranks and participated as a lieutenant in the United States military crackdown against strikers in the wake of the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>. He and a small contingent of sailors and marines defended the American consulate in <a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile">Santiago, Chile</a> during the <a href="1891%20Chilean%20Civil%20War">1891 Chilean Civil War</a>. He was a commander during the Spanish–American War, and his gunship successfully captured two Spanish Navy ships. After the war, he was made the first acting-Governor of <a href="American%20Samoa">Tutuila and Manua</a> (later called American Samoa) and set legal and administrative precedents for the new territory. After 41 years of service, he was promoted to rear admiral but died of pneumonia shortly afterwards.

Benjamin Franklin Tilley was born on March 29, 1848 in <a href="Bristol%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Bristol, Rhode Island</a>, the sixth of nine children. He enrolled in the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> on September 22, 1863 at the age of 15 and in the midst of the American Civil War. The war forced the school to relocate from <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, threatened by the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, to <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. In 1866, he graduated first in his class, going on to serve as a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> first on board and then . He spent three years serving on board "Frolic", eventually being promoted to ensign. His next assignment was on board , where he was promoted to master in 1870 and then to lieutenant in 1871. From 1872 to 1875, he served on board in the South Pacific. After "Pensacola", he served briefly on board and then spent two years serving on .

In July 1877, a violent <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">railroad strike</a> began in <a href="Martinsburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Martinsburg, West Virginia</a>, sparking riots in other American cities such as <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> authorized the use of the military in response. Tilley was temporarily transferred to during the crisis, sailing up the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington included the army, navy, and marines organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain <a href="Edward%20Gabriel%20Andr%C3%A9%20Barrett">Edward Barrett</a>; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore; the riots were also quashed in other cities within a short time.
After the strike, Tilley was transferred to the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> before requesting to take a six-month leave so that he could marry. On June 6, 1878, he married Emily Edelin Williamson, the daughter of a Navy surgeon, and left with her on an extended honeymoon in Europe. On his return to duty, Tilley served at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> and remained there until 1882, either in a classroom or on a training ship. For the next three years, he served on board . In 1885, he was promoted to lieutenant commander and returned to teach at the academy. During his tenure there, he was appointed head of the Department of Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying, and then transferred to become head of the Department of Mechanical Drawing. In September 1889, he moved to the <a href="Washington%20Navy%20Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a> to teach ordnance.

In 1890, Tilley was transferred to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> to help test the newly built and to become her executive officer. "San Francisco" transported troops to the port of <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a> during the <a href="1891%20Chilean%20Civil%20War">1891 Chilean Civil War</a>, from which they could move on to protect the American consulate in the capital of <a href="Santiago">Santiago</a>. Insurgents captured the city, and Tilley remained to defend the consulate with a force of 100 men. After the war, he returned to the naval academy as head of the astronomy and navigation department. In 1896, he took command of and sailed on an inspection tour of naval yards along the east coast of the United States. He was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> that October. In 1897, he was given command of to sail to <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> to evaluate the progress of the <a href="Nicaragua%20Canal">isthmus canal commission</a>.

On April 23, 1898, <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spain declared war</a> on the United States in response to American efforts to support Cuban independence. Tilley was in the Caribbean in command of "Newport" and in the heart of the conflict area. The United States responded with its own declaration of war against Spain on April 25, and Tilley captured the Spanish Navy's <a href="Sloop-of-war">sloop</a> "Paquete" and <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Pireno" two days later. He participated in the <a href="blockade">naval blockade</a> of <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> but missed the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Battle of Santiago de Cuba</a>, as "Newport" was refueling at <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a> when fighting broke out. Toward the end of the war, he was responsible for shelling the Cuban port of <a href="Manzanillo%2C%20Cuba">Manzanillo</a>. He and "Newport" assisted in the capture of nine Spanish vessels, and he was transferred to the <a href="Newport%20Naval%20Yard">Newport Naval Yard</a> at the conclusion of the war, then given the command of in October.

The United States first expressed interest in building a <a href="naval%20station">naval station</a> at <a href="Pago%20Pago%2C%20American%20Samoa">Pago Pago, Samoa</a> in 1872 at the behest of <a href="Henry%20A.%20Peirce">Henry A. Peirce</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Minister%20to%20Hawaii">United States Minister to Hawaii</a>. A treaty to that effect was written and submitted, but it was not approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. On February 13, 1878, a separate treaty was ratified by the Senate that granted the Samoan government diplomatic recognition and reaffirmed permission to build a naval station in the country. There were no further political obstacles, but funding for the station was not allocated and only a small coaling station was built on the island. Construction of the naval station did not begin until 1898, led by civilian contractors. In early 1899, Tilley was assigned the task of overseeing the station construction and becoming its first commandant. He was also put in command of the <a href="collier%20%28ship%29">collier ship</a> to transport steel and coal to the construction site and to serve as the first station ship. After a long voyage, he took his new post on August 13, 1899.

Even before Tilley arrived in Samoa, the political situation there was shifting. The <a href="Second%20Samoan%20Civil%20War">Second Samoan Civil War</a> had recently ended, leaving the islands without a functioning central government. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany had competing strategic and economic interests in the region. Ratification of the <a href="Tripartite%20Convention">Tripartite Convention</a> on February 16, 1900 partitioned the Samoan archipelago. The eastern part, with Tutuila as its largest island, was placed under the control of the United States. The larger and historically dominant western part was assigned to Germany. Under this treaty, the British government relinquished its claims over Samoa in exchange for certain concessions from Germany in the Pacific and Africa.

After learning of the agreement, Tilley notified the local chiefs and asserted nominal United States control, but a formal decision had not yet been made on how the United States government would manage the territory. The construction of the naval base remained his primary responsibility, and he was dispatched to pick up additional supplies and coal at <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand. President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> placed the territory under the control of the United States Navy on February 19, 1900, and Assistant <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Charles%20H.%20Allen">Charles H. Allen</a> named Tilley commandant of <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Station%20Tutuila">United States Naval Station Tutuila</a> with a charter to "cultivate friendly relations with the natives".

Tilley's first task in his new role was to negotiate a deed of cession with the local powers to ensure a formal and peaceful transfer of control to the United States. With the partitioning of Samoa, two regional governments remained on Tutuila which had been subordinated to a government on the western, German-controlled island of Upolu. Both of these governments were favorable toward the cession. The inhabitants of the island of <a href="Tau%2C%20American%20Samoa">Tau</a> and the volcanic doublet of <a href="Ofu-Olosega">Ofu-Olosega</a> (together known as <a href="Manu%27a">Manu'a</a>) to the east were politically separate from Tutuila. On March 12, 1900, Tilley traveled to Tau to meet with the local king <a href="Tui%20Manu%CA%BBa%20Elisala">Tui Manuʻa Elisala</a>. Ultimately, the king agreed to cede some sovereignty to the United States, but refused to consider full cession. The deed of cession was signed on April 17, 1900 and listed Manu'a as part of the United States' new territory, but without the signature of its representative. In it, Tilley was named Acting Governor; the territory did not have an official governor until the title was given to Governor <a href="Edmund%20Beardsley%20Underwood">Edmund Beardsley Underwood</a> in 1905. Manu'a did not agree to sign the deed until 1904, after negotiating concessions from the United States.

Tilley's first acts were to impose a <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duty</a> on imports to the territory, ban the sale of alcohol to the local population (but not Americans), and forbid the sale of Samoan lands to non-Samoans. On May 1, 1900, he proclaimed that the laws of the United States were in force in the territory, but that Samoan laws that did not conflict with U.S. law would remain in effect. He partitioned the territory into three districts, along the historical divisions implicitly acknowledged in the deed of cession: the two governments on Tutuila and the third comprising the islands of Manu'a, which still did not regard themselves as part of the territory. Over the next year, Tilley regulated firearms, enforced mandatory registrations of births, deaths, and marriages, levied taxes, and made the sabbath a public holiday. He created a small <a href="militia">militia</a> of native Samoans called the Fita Fita Guard for defense and police. The native volunteers in this force were trained at the naval station by a sergeant of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>.

Problems arose during Tilley's administration because of conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a <a href="Skipjack%20tuna">skipjack</a>, a sacred fish which could only be eaten with the permission of a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have learned to love and respect".

Tilley took leave in June 1901 to return to Washington, leaving <a href="E.%20J.%20Dorn">E. J. Dorn</a> in command. Dorn subsequently had medical issues and was replaced by <a href="J.%20L.%20Jayne">J. L. Jayne</a> in October. That month, an anonymous complaint was made to Assistant <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Frank%20W.%20Hackett">Frank W. Hackett</a> against Commandant Tilley, alleging immorality and <a href="drunkenness">drunkenness</a>. Almost simultaneously, he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> by President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. Tilley returned to Samoa on November 7, 1901 with his wife, and two days later was given a <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a>. The trial lasted four days and only one witness was called for the prosecution. Ultimately, he was acquitted. Despite this, Captain <a href="Uriel%20Sebree">Uriel Sebree</a> was appointed as commandant on November 27, 1901. Tilley and his wife returned to the United States the following month.

Sebree later remarked of his predecessor that he had "great ability, kindness, tact and sound common sense". Unlike Sebree, who was concerned that he did not have a legal mandate to govern, Tilley was not shy about enacting legislation and being the "de facto" leader of the territory. Although the deed of cession recognized his authority and gave him the title of Acting Governor, as far as the United States government was concerned, he was officially responsible only for the naval station. As the first naval governor, Tilley laid the groundwork for much of the future governance of the territory, which did not yet even have a formal name. The American Samoa government includes Tilley and the other pre-1905 station commandants in its list of territorial governors.

Tilley's next assignment came in March 1902 as a captain of the <a href="Mare%20Island%20Naval%20Shipyard">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</a> in <a href="Vallejo%2C%20California">Vallejo, California</a>. He remained in this post for three years before being assigned to on January 11, 1905. On February 23, 1907, he was made commandant of <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">League Island Naval Yard</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, and he was promoted to <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">rear admiral</a> the following day. He died of pneumonia less than a month later on March 18, 1907. 

Tilley was one of 322 men and women who had died in 1907 listed by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" as "foremost in their various callings." He was survived by one son and two daughters. His son Benjamin Franklin Tilley, Jr. also entered the Navy and retired with the rank of lieutenant commander.

Petropavlovsk-class battleship

The "Petropavlovsk" class, sometimes referred to as the "Poltava" class, was a group of three <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> during the 1890s. They were transferred to the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Squadron</a> shortly after their completion in 1899–1900 and were based at <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> before the start of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–1905. All three ships participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> on the second day of the war. sank two months after the war began after striking one or more <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> laid by the Japanese. Her two <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, and , took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a> in August 1904 and were sunk or <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> during the final stages of the <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Siege of Port Arthur</a> in early 1905.

"Poltava" was <a href="marine%20salvage">salvaged</a> after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. The ship, renamed "Tango" in Japanese service, participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsingtao">Battle of Tsingtao</a> in late 1914, during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She was sold back to the Russians in 1916 and renamed "Chesma" as her original name was in use by another battleship. The ship became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Russian <a href="Arctic%20Ocean%20Flotilla">Arctic Flotilla</a> in 1917, and her crew supported the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s later that year. "Chesma" was seized by the British in early 1918 when they <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">intervened</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>, abandoned by them when they withdrew and <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> by the Soviets in 1924.

<a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III</a>'s ambitious building programme of 1882 called for construction of 16 battleships in 20 years for the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>. By 1890 the program was behind schedule and the director of the <a href="Naval%20Ministry%20%28Russia%29">Naval Ministry</a>, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> , proposed that six first-class and four second-class battleships be built together with some armored coast-defense ships to make up the numbers required. The "Petropavlovsk"-class ships were designed as first-class battleships to meet his requirement for a heavily armored ship that <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> and had a speed of , a maximum <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of and a range of with good <a href="seakeeping">seakeeping</a> qualities.

The design began as an enlarged and improved version of the battleship , but with her <a href="Main%20battery">main armament</a> of four guns mounted in lighter <a href="barbettes">barbettes</a> rather than the heavy <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s of the older ship. Based on experience with , in which the <a href="casemate">casemate</a>-mounted <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> could often not be worked in rough weather, the Naval Technical Committee (NTC) adopted the layout of the American s with the secondary armament mounted in <a href="turret">turret</a>s on the upper deck. Use of the lighter barbette mounting allowed for a <a href="flush%20deck">flush-deck</a> hull, which gave the design high <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a>. It was approved in January 1891 by the NTC with a displacement of and a full-length <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">armor belt</a>.

The design was intended to have a maximum speed of 17 knots using <a href="Draft%20%28boiler%29">forced draft</a>, but model testing of the hull showed that it could only reach . Rather than delay construction by redesigning the hull, the navy accepted the slower speed. Development of the <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) gun</a> meant that an upper belt of armor was necessary and the weight required was gained by shortening the waterline armor belt, which left the ships' ends protected only by the sloping armor <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>. Other changes included the replacement of the barbettes with turrets of the same type as used in the battleship and the substitution of QF guns for the original guns. This last change saved enough weight to permit four more six-inch guns to be added.

The "Petropavlovsk"-class ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a draught of . Designed to displace , they were overweight and actually displaced . The ships were the first flush-decked battleships built for the navy. They had a partial <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>, and the hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s; a centerline bulkhead divided the machinery spaces. The upper part of the hull between the main and upper decks curved inwards (<a href="tumblehome">tumblehome</a>). The "Petropavlovsk"s had a designed <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of and were good seagoing ships. Their crew consisted of 26–27 officers and 605–25 enlisted men; "Petropavlovsk" had a crew of 750 when serving as a flagship.

The ships were powered by two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 14 <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a> at a working pressure of . Unlike her sisters, "Sevastopol" had 16 boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of 16 knots. "Poltava" and "Petropavlovsk" used turbines and boilers imported from Britain and slightly exceeded their specifications; during their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, the ships reached maximum speeds of from , respectively. "Sevastopol", using domestically built machinery, only reached a speed of from , despite the extra boilers. The Naval Ministry chose not to exercise the penalty provisions of the contract for failing to attain the design speed because it had specified the machinery to be used. The "Petropavlovsk"s carried a maximum of of coal which allowed them to steam for at a speed of .

The main armament of the "Petropavlovsk" class consisted of four 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="Russian%2012%20inch%2040%20caliber%20naval%20gun">12-inch</a> guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. They used hydraulic power for loading and traversing, but the ammunition hoists were electrically powered. Designed to fire one shell every 90 seconds, the <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> of the guns in service proved to be one <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">round</a> every three minutes. The structure of the turrets proved to be too weak to withstand extra-strength charges and had to be reinforced. The guns could elevate to a maximum of +15° and <a href="Traverse%20%28gunnery%29">traverse</a> 270°; each was provided with 58 rounds. They fired a shell at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . This gave them a range of at an elevation of 10°.

The secondary armament of the ships consisted of a dozen 45-caliber QF <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">Model 1892 six-inch</a> guns. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun turrets on the upper deck and the remaining four guns were on pedestal mounts in unarmored <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s in the sides of the hull, one deck below and between the turrets. Electric motors traversed the turrets and worked the ammunition hoists, but the guns were elevated manually. They had a 135° arc of fire, and the guns could elevate to a maximum of +15° and depress to −5°. The rate of fire of the turret-mounted guns was generally only about half that (two to three rounds per minute) of the pedestal-mounted guns. The motors and mechanism of the ammunition hoists were troublesome and sometimes reduced the rate of fire down to one round per minute. The guns in the hull could traverse 100° and each six-inch gun was provided with 200 rounds. Their muzzle velocity of gave their shells a maximum range of .

Smaller guns were carried for defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. These included a dozen <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s in hull embrasures and on the superstructure. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . Twenty-eight smaller <a href="Hiram%20Maxim">Maxim</a> QF <a href="QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom">guns</a> were positioned in hull embrasures, on the superstructure and in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting tops</a>. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

The "Petropavlovsk"-class ships carried four <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all above water, mounted on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and two broadside underwater tubes. The forward 15-inch tubes were near the forward main gun turret and were unprotected by any armor; aft, the 15-inch tubes were protected by the upper armor belt. The underwater tubes were protected underneath the armor deck, forward of the forward 12-inch <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>. Each ship also carried 50 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be laid to protect its <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">anchorage</a> in remote areas.

The ships were fitted with Liuzhol <a href="Stadiametric%20rangefinding">stadiametric rangefinders</a> that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the <a href="crow%27s%20nest">crow's nest</a>, to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and <a href="deflection%20%28ballistics%29">deflection</a> required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control transmission system</a> to each gun or turret.

The Russian armor-plate industry had not yet mastered the process for forming thick steel plates so the armor for these ships was ordered from companies in Germany and the United States. Even they could not produce enough of the latest types of armor plate in the quantities required for all three ships. "Petropavlovsk" had ordinary <a href="nickel%20steel">nickel steel</a>, while "Sevastopol" used <a href="Harvey%20armor">Harvey armor</a> and "Poltava" was fitted with the latest <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. The thicknesses of the armor plates varied in an attempt to equalize their effectiveness. In "Petropavlovsk", the maximum thickness of the waterline armor belt over the machinery spaces was , which reduced to 12 inches abreast the magazines and tapered to a thickness of 8 inches at its bottom edge. In the other two ships, it was thick over the machinery spaces, over the magazines and at its lower edge. The belt covered of the ships' length and was high, of which the upper was intended to be above the waterline. It terminated in transverse bulkheads thick fore and aft, leaving the ends of the ships unprotected. Above the waterline belt was an upper <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor that ran between the turret bases, seven and a half feet high. The ends of the upper belt were closed off by five-inch angled transverse bulkheads that connected the ends of the upper belt to the turret support tubes.

The armor of the main-gun turrets and their supporting tubes was 10 inches thick (Krupp armor in "Poltava", nickel steel in the other two) with roofs thick. The turrets of the secondary armament had 5-inch sides with roofs. The six-inch guns in the hull embrasures were unprotected. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were 9 inches thick while the armor deck in the central citadel was 2 inches thick. Outside the area covered by the belt armor, the flat portion of the deck was thick, while the sloped portion was thick.

"Petropavlovsk" was the first of the sisters to enter service; she departed <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> on 17 October 1899 and reached Port Arthur on 10 May 1900. Upon her arrival, she became flagship of the Pacific Squadron commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Nikolai%20Skrydlov">Nikolai Skrydlov</a>. The ship supported international efforts to suppress the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> in mid-1900. "Poltava" and "Sevastopol" departed for Port Arthur on 15 October 1900 and arrived on 12 and 13 April 1901 respectively. "Petropavlovsk" was the flagship of Vice Admiral <a href="Oskar%20Stark">Oskar Stark</a> at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904.

During the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war, "Poltava" was hit twice in the aft hull, "Petropavlovsk" was hit three times in the bow and "Sevastopol" was hit once. Between them, the sisters had two men killed and seven wounded and were not significantly damaged. None of them made any hits on Japanese ships. The Naval Ministry relieved Stark, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral <a href="Stepan%20Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a> who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, "Petropavlovsk" and "Poltava" <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d to support Russian <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they headed back to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid <a href="minefield">minefield</a> en route and "Petropavlovsk" struck at least one of the mines, sinking in less than two minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, the <a href="war%20artist">war artist</a> <a href="Vasily%20Vereshchagin">Vasily Vereshchagin</a>, 26 other officers and 652 enlisted men. Only 7 officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.

The new commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a>, made an attempt to lead the Pacific Squadron to <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> on 23 June, but abandoned the sortie when the squadron was discovered and pursued by the Japanese. While returning to Port Arthur, "Sevastopol" struck a mine, and the ship took on an estimated of water; despite the flooding she was able to keep up with the fleet and reached port successfully. While under repair, which lasted until 9 July, a fire broke out aboard the ship, killing 2 crewmen and injuring another 28. All of the 47- and 37-millimeter guns in the lower hull embrasures were removed from "Poltava" and "Sevastopol" during this time; some were remounted on the superstructure, but others were used to reinforce the land defenses of Port Arthur.

Vitgeft made another attempt to break through the Japanese blockade on 10 August in obedience to a direct order from Tsar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>. The squadron was spotted relatively quickly, and the Japanese main fleet intercepted the Russians in the early afternoon. In the resulting the Battle of the Yellow Sea, "Poltava" and "Sevastopol" were the last battleships in the Russian column and the former, slowed by engine problems, became the primary target of the Japanese battleships and <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s when Vitgeft maneuvered the squadron past the Japanese and forced them into a stern chase. Shortly before sunset, a lucky hit killed Vitgeft and threw the squadron into confusion. The Russian second-in-command, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Prince <a href="Pavel%20Ukhtomsky">Pavel Ukhtomsky</a>, eventually gained control of the squadron and led most of the ships back to Port Arthur. "Poltava" was hit by 12–14 large-caliber shells and lost 12 crewmen killed and 43 wounded; "Sevastopol" was hit by several shells that killed 1 and wounded 62 crewmen.
On 23 August, "Sevastopol" sortied to bombard Japanese troops and struck a mine near her forward magazines while returning to port. She was badly damaged and three of her magazines were flooded. The ship was towed back into Port Arthur and her repairs lasted until 6 November. In the meantime, the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20Viren">Robert Viren</a>, decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur, and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. By September "Poltava" had dismounted three 6-inch, four 47- and twenty-six 37-millimeter guns, and "Sevastopol" lost one 47- and twenty-six 37-millimeter guns. Both ships were lightly damaged by shells in October when the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s siege guns began firing blindly into the harbor. The capture of <a href="203%20Hill">Hill 203</a>, which overlooked the harbor, on 5 December allowed them to fire directly at the Russian ships, and "Poltava" was sunk in shallow water that same day by a shell that started a fire in a magazine that eventually exploded. By 7 December all of the Russian battleships except "Sevastopol" had been sunk and the ship's captain, <a href="Nikolai%20Essen">Nikolai Essen</a>, anchored her under the guns of the remaining <a href="Coastal%20artillery">coast defense guns</a> outside the harbor. He rigged <a href="torpedo%20net">torpedo net</a>s and laid a minefield around his ship that thwarted repeated attacks until 16 December when one torpedo struck the ship in the stern during a blinding snowstorm. Badly damaged, "Sevastopol" was towed to deep water about two weeks later, when Port Arthur surrendered on 2 January 1905 and scuttled.
"Poltava" was subsequently raised, repaired and reclassified as a first-class <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> in the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. Renamed "Tango" (丹後), she served as a gunnery training ship and participated in the Siege of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I. She was sold back to Russia in March 1916 as the countries were now allies against the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> and arrived in Vladivostok on 2 April 1916. Renamed "Chesma" ("Чесма"), because her original name was being used by a , the ship arrived in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, Egypt, on 19 September, and later supported efforts to intimidate the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greek Government</a> into supporting <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Allied operations</a> in <a href="Macedonia%20%28Greece%29">Macedonia</a>. She arrived at <a href="Polyarny%2C%20Murmansk%20Oblast">Alexandrovsk</a> on 16 January 1917 after a brief refit in <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> and became flagship of the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean%20Flotilla">Arctic Flotilla</a>. Her crew joined the Bolsheviks in October 1917 and "Chesma" was captured by the British in <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> in March 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The ship was already in poor condition, and the British immobilized her when they departed Russia in October 1919. She was stricken from the <a href="Navy%20List">Navy List</a> on 3 July 1924 and subsequently scrapped.

Stanley Green

Stanley Owen Green (22 February 1915 – 4 December 1993), known as the Protein Man, was a <a href="human%20billboard">human billboard</a> in <a href="central%20London">central London</a> in the latter half of the 20th century. One writer called him "the most famous non-famous person in London". According to <a href="Lynne%20Truss">Lynne Truss</a>, Green became such a ubiquitous figure in and around <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a> in the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a> that, like <a href="Zelig">Zelig</a>, he was "present in every black-and-white picture of London crowds that one has ever seen". 

For 25 years, from 1968 until 1993, Green patrolled Oxford Street with a placard recommending "<a href="Protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a> wisdom", a <a href="low-protein%20diet">low-protein diet</a> that he said would dampen the <a href="libido">libido</a> and make people kinder. His 14-page self-published pamphlet, "Eight Passion Proteins with Care" went through 84 editions and sold 87,000 copies over 20 years.

Green's "campaigning for the suppression of desire", as one writer described it, was not always popular, but Londoners developed an affection for him. The "Sunday Times" interviewed him in 1985, and the fashion house <a href="Red%20or%20Dead">Red or Dead</a> used his "less passion from less protein" slogan in one of its collections. When he died aged 78, the "Daily Telegraph", "Guardian" and "Times" all published obituaries, and the <a href="Museum%20of%20London">Museum of London</a> acquired his pamphlets and placards. In 2006 his biography was included in the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>.

Green was born in <a href="Harringay">Harringay</a>, north London, the youngest of four boys to May Green and her husband, Richard Green, a clerk for a <a href="Stopper%20%28plug%29">bottle stopper</a> manufacturer. After attending <a href="Woodside%20High%20School%2C%20Wood%20Green">Wood Green comprehensive school</a>, Green joined the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in 1938. According to Philip Carter in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", Green was shocked while in the Navy by the obsession with sex. "I was astonished when things were said quite openly—what a husband would say to his wife when home on leave," he told the "Sunday Times" "A Life in the Day" column in 1985. "I've always been a moral sort of person."

After leaving the Navy in September 1945, Green worked for the <a href="Fine%20Art%20Society">Fine Art Society</a>. In March 1946, Carter writes, he failed the entrance exam for the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>, then worked for <a href="Selfridges">Selfridges</a> and the civil service, and as a storeman for <a href="Ealing%20Borough%20Council">Ealing Borough Council</a>. On two occasions he had lost jobs, he said, because he had refused to be dishonest. In 1962 he held a job with the post office, then worked as a self-employed gardener until 1968 when he began his anti-protein campaign. He lived with his parents until they died, his father in 1966 and his mother the following year, after which he was given a <a href="Council%20house">council flat</a> in Haydock Green, <a href="Northolt">Northolt</a>, north London.

Green began his mission in June 1968, at the age of 53, initially in <a href="Harrow%2C%20London">Harrow</a> on Saturdays, becoming a full-time human billboard six months later on Oxford Street. He cycled there from Northolt with a <a href="sandwich%20board">sandwich board</a> attached to his bicycle, a journey that could take up to two hours, until he was given a <a href="bus%20pass">bus pass</a> when he turned 65.

He rose early, and after porridge for breakfast made bread that would rise while he was on patrol, ready for his evening meal. Otherwise his diet consisted of steamed vegetables and pulses, and a pound of apples a day. Lunch was prepared on a <a href="Bunsen%20burner">Bunsen burner</a> and eaten at 2:30 in a "warm and secret place" near Oxford Street. From Monday to Saturday he walked up and down the street until 6:30 pm, reduced to four days a week from 1985. Saturday evenings were spent with the cinema crowds in <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>. He would go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the "Sunday Times" in 1985. "It is a sort of acknowledgment of God, just in case there happens to be one."

<a href="Peter%20Ackroyd">Peter Ackroyd</a> wrote in "" (2000) that Green was for the most part ignored, becoming "a poignant symbol of the city's incuriosity and forgetfulness". He was arrested for public obstruction twice, in 1980 and 1985. "The injustice of it upsets me," he said, "because I'm doing such a good job." He took to wearing overalls to protect himself from spit, which he found several times on his hat at the end of the day.

Sundays were spent at home producing "Eight Passion Proteins" on his printing press, exhibited after his death at the <a href="Serpentine%20Gallery">Serpentine Gallery</a> and described by <a href="Waldemar%20Januszczak">Waldemar Januszczak</a> as "an extraordinary home-made contraption worthy of <a href="W.%20Heath%20Robinson">Heath Robinson</a>". The "terrific sounds of thumping and crashing" caused trouble between Green and his neighbours. Noted for its eccentric typography, "Eight Passion Proteins" went through 84 editions, 52 of them between 1973 and 1993. Green carried copies of it in his satchel, selling 20 on weekdays and up to 50 on Saturdays, for 10 pence in 1980 and later 12 pence. By February 1993 he would have sold 87,000 copies, according to Carter. He also sent it to public figures, including five British prime ministers, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a>.

The pamphlet argued that "those who do not have to work hard with their limbs, and those who are inclined to sit about" will "store up their protein for passion", making retirement, for example, a period of increased passion and marital discord. It ended by warning: "Beware of the fun of indecent suggestions; of the amusement from the titillating scandal of private lives; of the diversion of the undress of low journalism etcetera. These things erode our morals and twist young minds." In addition to the pamphlet, Green left several unpublished manuscripts, including a novel, "Behind the Veil: More than Just a Tale"; a 67-page text, "Passion and Protein"; and a 392-page edition of "Eight Passion Proteins", which, Carter writes, was rejected by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> in 1971.

Green enjoyed his local fame. "The Sunday Times" interviewed him in 1985 for its "A Life in the Day" feature, and some of his slogans, including "less passion from less protein" were used on dresses and t-shirts by the London fashion house <a href="Red%20or%20Dead">Red or Dead</a>. When he died in 1993 at the age of 78, the "Daily Telegraph", "Guardian" and "Times" all published obituaries. His letters, diaries, pamphlets and placards were given to the Museum of London, which as of 2010 held 36 of the 84 editions of "Eight Passion Proteins with Care". Other artefacts went to the <a href="Gunnersbury%20Park%20Museum">Gunnersbury Park Museum</a>. His printing press was included in <a href="Cornelia%20Parker">Cornelia Parker</a>'s exhibition "The Maybe" (1995) at the Serpentine Gallery, featuring <a href="Tilda%20Swinton">Tilda Swinton</a> in a glass box, as well as a cushion and carpet apparently from <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freud</a>'s couch and one of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s cigars. 

Years after his death Green was still remembered by writers and bloggers. In 2006 he was given an entry in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", while the artist Alun Rowlands' documentary fiction, "3 Communiqués" (2007), portrayed him as "trawl[ing] the city campaigning for the suppression of desire through diet". In 2013 <a href="Martin%20Gordon">Martin Gordon</a> included a track about him on his album "<a href="Include%20Me%20Out">Include Me Out</a>". Peter Watts wrote in "<a href="Londonist">Londonist</a>" in 2016 that Green was for a time "the most famous non-famous person in London, a figure recognised by millions even if few ever actually spoke to him. Oxford Circus has never felt quite the same without him." When Green died, Lynne Truss suggested in "The Times" that he be inserted retroactively into the final paragraph of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' novel "<a href="Little%20Dorritt">Little Dorritt</a>":

New Carissa

<a href="Ship%20prefix">MV</a> New Carissa was a <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighter</a> that ran aground on a <a href="beach">beach</a> near <a href="Coos%20Bay%2C%20Oregon">Coos Bay</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow the <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The <a href="stern">stern</a> section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>" with napalm, but a significant amount was also <a href="oil%20spill">spilled</a> from the wreckage, causing <a href="ecology">ecological</a> damage to the <a href="coast">coast</a>line.

The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> performed an investigation and found that <a href="Captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>'s error was the main cause of the wreck; however, no <a href="criminal%20law">criminal</a> <a href="Legal%20liability">liability</a> was established and the captain and <a href="Seafarer%27s%20professions%20and%20ranks">crew</a> were not charged. There were significant legal and financial consequences for the ship's owners and insurer.

The stern section remained aground for over nine years. It was <a href="ship%20breaking">dismantled</a> and removed from the beach in 2008.

"New Carissa" was a <a href="Panama">Panama</a>nian-<a href="flag%20of%20convenience">flagged</a> dry <a href="bulk%20freighter">bulk freighter</a> optimized for carriage of <a href="woodchips">woodchips</a>. She was owned by the Japanese shipping concern <a href="Nippon%20Yusen%20Kaisha">Nippon Yusen Kaisha</a> via a subsidiary, Green Atlas Shipping. The ship's operator and manager, Taiheiyo Kaiun Co. Ltd. and TMM Co. Ltd. respectively, were also based in Japan. The <a href="ship">vessel</a> was built by <a href="Imabari%20Shipbuilding">Imabari Shipbuilding</a> Co. in Japan using an all-<a href="steel">steel</a> construction, and was <a href="Keel%23Structural%20keels">laid down</a> on 30 August 1989. The freighter was long and wide, with a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of when fully loaded. She had a <a href="gross%20tonnage">gross tonnage</a> of 36,571 tons, a <a href="net%20tonnage">net tonnage</a> of 16,524 tons, and was powered by an direct-drive <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>. She had a maximum crew complement of 26 <a href="Merchant%20Navy">sailors</a>, and was in service hauling woodchips (used for <a href="pulp%20%28paper%29">paper pulp</a> production). The ship's home port was <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and her crew at the time of her <a href="Ship%20grounding">grounding</a> consisted entirely of Philippine nationals, commanded by Benjamin Morgado. "New Carissa"s <a href="protection%20and%20indemnity%20insurance">protection and indemnity insurance</a> was provided by The Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association Ltd. The ship's Certificate of Financial Responsibility, which is required by the <a href="Oil%20Pollution%20Act%20of%201990">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> and included USD $23 million of environmental liability insurance, was provided by Shipowners Insurance and Guaranty Company Ltd. (SIGCo) of <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton, Bermuda</a>.

On 4 February 1999, "New Carissa" was bound for the <a href="Port%20of%20Coos%20Bay">Port of Coos Bay</a> to pick up a load of wood chips. The ship's crew was informed by the local <a href="bar%20pilot">bar pilot</a>s that weather conditions would prevent the ship (which was empty at the time) from entering <a href="Coos%20Bay">Coos Bay</a> <a href="harbor">harbor</a> until the next morning. The captain ordered the ship to drop <a href="anchor">anchor</a> off the coast in order to ride out the storm. The crew used a single anchor to secure the ship. According to a <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> review of the incident, the chain used was too short. The short chain and the weather conditions, including winds of , caused the ship to drag her anchor. Poor navigational techniques and inadequate <a href="watchstanding">watchkeeping</a> led to the crew's failure to notice that the ship was moving. Once movement was detected, the crew attempted to raise anchor and maneuver away from the shore, but the weather and sea conditions made this difficult. By the time the anchor was raised, the ship had been pushed too close to the shore to recover.

The ship ran aground on the beach 2.7 statute miles (4.5 km) north of the entrance to Coos Bay, and attempts to refloat her failed. Two of the five <a href="fuel%20tank">fuel tank</a>s on the ship began to leak fuel onto the beach, eventually spilling approximately of viscous "bunker C" <a href="Fuel%20oil%23Bunker%20fuel">fuel oil</a> and <a href="Diesel%20fuel">diesel</a> onto the beach and into the water.

Neither the <a href="Sea%20captain">captain</a> nor any of the 22-man crew was injured in the incident.

Recovery operations began immediately when the grounding was first reported by the ship's crew. Several factors combined to severely complicate the operation. A Unified Command for the operation, consisting of representatives from the Coast Guard, the <a href="Government%20of%20Oregon">State of Oregon</a>, and rescue party operations, was quickly established.

Initial rescue operations were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move "New Carissa" under her own power failed, and <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a> assistance was not available immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but she was unable to cross the Coos Bay <a href="shoal">bar</a> because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued "New Carissa". The nearest <a href="salvage%20tug">salvage tug</a>boat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, "Salvage Chief", was moored at her home port of <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, 200 statute miles (320 km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. "Salvage Chief" had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18 hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous <a href="Columbia%20Bar">Columbia River bar</a> for an additional two days. "Salvage Chief" did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.

Continued poor weather drove "New Carissa" closer to the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had been working with the Coast Guard since 5 February and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were observed on 8 February, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, "Salvage Chief", upon her arrival, was unable to reach "New Carissa" with her tow gear. On 10 February, "New Carissa" suffered major <a href="structural%20failure">structural failure</a> when the <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, "New Carissa" was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a <a href="shipwreck">shipwreck</a>.

Since the vessel was no longer seaworthy and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, the focus of the operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the <a href="ocean%20surface%20wave">surf</a>. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on 10 February. <a href="Napalm">Napalm</a> and other <a href="incendiary%20device">incendiary device</a>s were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on 11 February when <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> explosive experts placed 39 <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a>s to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. of napalm and nearly of <a href="plastic%20explosive">plastic explosive</a>s were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33 hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between . The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on 11 February.
After additional weather-related delays, on 26 February salvors managed to float the <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> section and began the process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By 1 March, the tugboat "Sea Victory" had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a> vessel, OSRV "Oregon Responder". However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near <a href="Waldport%2C%20Oregon">Waldport</a>, Oregon on 3 March, approximately to the north of the original grounding site. On 8 March, the bow was again refloated, and by 11 March it was successfully towed off the coast by "Sea Victory" and a second tug, "Natoma". At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> and the <a href="submarine">submarine</a> . Four hundred pounds (180 kg) of <a href="explosive%20material">high explosives</a> were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from "David R. Ray"s deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, "Bremerton" fired a <a href="Mark%2048%20torpedo">Mark 48</a> <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.

The stern section remained aground, but did not pose a significant oil spill threat as the majority of the oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some remaining oil that was found on board was skimmed or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a <a href="ship%20breaking">ship breaking</a> contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of the stern, their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed the stern should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging the stern removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.

Although the initial attempts to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended to see the remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were complicated by the fact that the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be below the sand line.

A project to remove the stern by dismantling it on the beach was started in June 2008, after <a href="Oregon%20Legislative%20Assembly">Oregon legislative</a> approval. The dismantling, expected to cost USD $18 million, was approved by the State Legislative Emergency Board in September 2006. The move was originally scheduled for 2007, but delays in the negotiations pushed the project back a year. Due to weather and surf conditions, the project had to be undertaken during the spring and summer months. Titan Maritime Company, a subsidiary of <a href="Crowley%20Maritime">Crowley Maritime Corporation</a>, signed a USD $16.4 million contract with the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20State%20Lands">Oregon Department of State Lands</a>. Titan Maritime used large <a href="jackup%20barge">jackup barge</a>s, "Karlissa A" and "Karlissa B", for the "New Carissa" dismantling project. Once the barges were in place, a cable car system was installed to allow the crews and their equipment access to the barges from the beach. The barges allowed the crews to access the wreck from above the surf. The crews cut "New Carissa" into removable pieces and then lifted them to the barges with cranes. The cutting portion of Titan's plan was largely completed by 31 July 2008, and the company then focused on pulling the stern from the sand, a process that was measured in inches. The project's managing director expressed confidence that the removal deadline of 1 October 2008 would be met. By September 2008, Titan had successfully removed the majority of the wreck; no part of the ship was visible from above the water, and only a few relatively small pieces remained submerged. "Karlissa A" and "Karlissa B" were relocated on 12 October 2008, and Titan's shore operations were completely removed by November 2008.

Prior to the dismantling project, there was debate by local residents on whether the wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which lay on a remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. <a href="Arnie%20Roblan">Arnie Roblan</a>, a <a href="Oregon%20House%20of%20Representatives">state representative</a> from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern would be unable to withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay <a href="city%20council">city council</a> expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that "shipwrecks on the <a href="Oregon%20Coast">Oregon Coast</a> are part of our history. There are a lot of ways you could better spend the money here."

Many others argued that the ship should be removed. Louise Solliday, the director of the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20State%20Lands">Oregon Department of State Lands</a>, called the removal of the stern a necessary step to demonstrate that the state is "serious about removing wrecks". She stated that if the stern were not removed, the argument that the ship is trespassing on state property (used in the state's lawsuit against "New Carissa" owners) would be undermined should another vessel wreck off the Oregon coast. The sentiment was later echoed by Oregon <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28U.S.%20state%20government%29">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Bill%20Bradbury">Bill Bradbury</a>, who also noted that the settlement of the lawsuit with the ship's owners leaves the state exposed to any liability issues concerning the ship. Many environmentalists, as well as federal <a href="biologist">biologist</a>s and residents of the local community, were concerned about the potential for further ecological damage should the vessel leak any of the fuel oil that remained on board. The editorial board of "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" argued that allowing the stern to remain would send a message that the state is willing to "tolerate permanent damage to its beaches". The newspaper also rejected the notion that the wreckage should be compared to , a <a href="sailing%20ship">sailing ship</a> that wrecked on a beach near Astoria in the early 1900s, and whose remnants are a popular tourist draw.

The wreck of "New Carissa" caused one of the most serious <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s to affect the state of Oregon, and the worst since a 1984 spill near <a href="Longview%2C%20Washington">Longview, Washington</a> that dumped of oil into the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. As Oregon has no significant <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> facilities, <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a>s do not often dock at its ports, making the state relatively safe from oil spills. Analysis conducted by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> determined that over 3,000 <a href="wader">shorebirds</a> and <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s perished. The birds belonged to more than 50 species. Among the birds killed were 262 <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> <a href="marbled%20murrelet">marbled murrelet</a>s and between four and eight <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> <a href="snowy%20plover">western snowy plovers</a>. <a href="Harbor%20seal">Harbor seal</a>s, fish, and <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> were also killed or affected. Several beaches were fouled, with <a href="Tarball%20%28oil%29">tarballs</a> continuing to wash up for more than a month after the wreck.

Despite the loss of <a href="marine%20biology">marine life</a>, the initial burning of the oil and the successful removal of the bow section prevented what could have been a worse spill. Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that "at least 82 percent of the oil on board "New Carissa" never reached the wildlife or the pristine shoreline of Oregon's coast". The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed out beyond the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>, into very deep water. Any remaining oil on board is unlikely to have affected marine life since the low temperatures at the bottom of the ocean would have caused it to solidify.

Prior to the stern section's removal from the beach, <a href="environmentalism">environmentalists</a> and local officials were concerned that the remains posed a continuing environmental and safety hazard.
Subsequent <a href="litigation">litigation</a> proved expensive for the ship's owners and insurers, and an investigation into the incident delayed most of the crew's return to their home country.

In 2001, Green Atlas Shipping and its insurer, Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association, sued the United States for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US</a>$96 million, claiming <a href="negligence">negligence</a> on the part of the Coast Guard due to faulty <a href="nautical%20chart">nautical chart</a>s. They also alleged failure on the part of the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and that <a href="dredging">dredging</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> had exacerbated the problems with the anchor. The U.S. countersued for US$7 million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas would pay the U.S. US$10.5 million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4 million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. The net result of the settlement was payment of US$6.5 million to the U.S. Although this was far less than the damages claimed by the U.S. for environmental cleanup and <a href="environmental%20restoration">restoration</a> costs, government officials still saw the <a href="settlement%20%28law%29">settlement</a> as a victory since the shipping company was forced to pay for part of the damage. Some <a href="Coos%20County%2C%20Oregon">Coos County</a> officials were dissatisfied with the settlement, however, stating that it should have instead been paid to local business owners who were negatively impacted by the closure of the beach.

The State of Oregon demanded that the ship's owners or their insurers remove the ship or pay a US$25 million <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a> to cover the cost of removing the ship and for environmental damages. The state also filed a lawsuit in Coos County, demanding removal, storage fees of USD $1,500 per day, restoration of the beach, and other unspecified damages. The state alleged negligence on the part of Morgado and also accused Green Atlas shipping of attempting to avoid the expense of the stern dismantling. On 13 November 2002, a Coos County jury found the ship's owners guilty of negligent <a href="trespass">trespass</a> after a six-week trial; the state was awarded US$25 million in damages. That sum was placed in <a href="escrow">escrow</a>, pending appeal. The <a href="Oregon%20circuit%20courts">circuit court</a> judge later remarked that the case was the most memorable of his 37-year career, noting that "You don’t usually get trespass cases that involve a ship". On 23 May 2006, a settlement was reached in the appeal; the state kept US$20 million of the US$25 million in escrow, plus US$2.1 million in interest earned on the escrow account. The remaining US$5 million was returned to Green Atlas Shipping. Of the US$22.1 million that the state was awarded in the settlement, US$3.1 million was used to pay the state's legal fees. The remaining US$19 million was reserved for cleanup, including the removal of the vessel's stern.

Numerous private parties, including at least one <a href="oyster%20farming">oyster farmer</a> whose beds were contaminated by oil, successfully sued for damages.

The captain and most of the crew of the ship—all nationals of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>—had to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On 16 September, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the <a href="Chief%20Mate">first</a> and <a href="Third%20Mate">third officers</a> of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the "New Carissa" crew.

Portland-based musician <a href="Sarah%20Dougher">Sarah Dougher</a>'s 2000 album "The Walls Ablaze" included a song titled "The New Carissa".

Bryan Gunn

Bryan James Gunn (born 22 December 1963) is a Scottish former professional <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> and <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">football manager</a>. After learning his trade with <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> in the early 1980s, he spent most of his playing career at <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, the club with which he came to be most closely associated. This was followed by a brief spell back in Scotland with <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> before his retirement as a player in 1998.

Gunn feels the peak of his playing career was making what he calls the <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23S">save</a> of his life in <a href="Bayern%20Munich%20v%20Norwich%20City">the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich</a> in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>". He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Player of the Year</a> award twice. He was made an inaugural member of <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Norwich City's Hall of Fame</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland national football team</a>, making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.

Gunn worked for years behind the scenes at Norwich in a variety of roles, from matchday hosting to coaching. He was appointed temporary manager towards the end of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Championship">2008–09 season</a> and then confirmed as permanent manager during the summer. However, after a 7–1 home defeat in the opening game to local rivals <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>, he lost his job a week into the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20One">2009–10 Football League One</a> season.

Since the death of his young daughter from <a href="leukaemia">leukaemia</a> in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he has raised more than £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects to improve the lives of children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him <a href="List%20of%20shrievalties%23Town%20sheriffs">Sheriff</a> for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, "In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography", includes a foreword by his former manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>.

Gunn was born on 22 December 1963 in <a href="Thurso">Thurso</a>, Scotland, "twenty miles from <a href="John%20o%27%20Groats">John o'Groats</a>". His parents were James Gunn, a long-distance lorry driver, and Jessie Sinclair, a canteen worker at the <a href="Dounreay">Dounreay</a> nuclear power plant; the pair had married despite being on opposite sides of a family feud stretching back to the 16th century. James was an amateur sportsman, playing football on the right wing for local team <a href="Invergordon%20F.C.">Invergordon F.C.</a> and winning medals at <a href="highland%20games">highland games</a> events.

The Gunn family home in Thurso was a farm, and the young Bryan would often pester the farmhands to play football with him. They would use a <a href="turnip">turnip</a> if no ball was available. By the age of four he was keen on goalkeeping; he was fearless of injury and enjoyed diving on the ball. When Bryan was four-and-a-half, the family moved to <a href="Invergordon">Invergordon</a>, 20 miles from <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a>. He attended Park Primary School in the town and joined the school football team. Future professional <a href="Bobby%20Geddes">Bobby Geddes</a> was favoured over him as first-choice goalkeeper for the team; Gunn played as an <a href="outfield%20player">outfield player</a> until Geddes moved on to secondary school.

Gunn attended secondary school at <a href="Invergordon%20Academy">Invergordon Academy</a> from 1975 to 1980, and gained <a href="O%20Level">O Level</a>s in a variety of subjects, including English, maths, history and chemistry. He failed his French exam after taking it while "on the road" with <a href="Scotland%20national%20under-15%20football%20team">Scotland under-15s</a>. At the age of 13, he was invited to play for the under-15 Invergordon F.C. team by one of his school teachers, who managed the team. The team was beaten 9–0 in Gunn's debut, but his subsequent performances attracted the attention of national selectors, and he joined the Scotland under-15 squad around the same time he signed for <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> at age 14.

Gunn commenced his professional career with Aberdeen in 1980, and forged a good relationship with then-Aberdeen manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>—evidenced by the fact that in 1997 Ferguson brought <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> to <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a> for Gunn's <a href="testimonial%20match">testimonial match</a>. While an apprentice at Aberdeen, Gunn was a frequent babysitter for Ferguson's children. He later said, "I probably babysat more than I played". Gunn portrays the relationship as warm, but businesslike:

As a youngster, Gunn did not always play in goal and he was viewed as a handy outfield player in his early years at Aberdeen. Ferguson recalls, "He could strike a ball as well as anyone, so well in fact that I once played him at centre-forward in a reserve match ... He scored a brilliant goal ... It was a marvellous moment." However, as a professional, and at his adult height of , Gunn settled into playing in goal.

Gunn ascribes much of his goalkeeping success to the support of Belgian <a href="Marc%20De%20Clerck">Marc De Clerck</a>, a specialist goalkeeping coach at Aberdeen. At a time when few British teams provided such training, De Clerck introduced Gunn and Scottish international keeper <a href="Jim%20Leighton">Jim Leighton</a> to what were then innovative training techniques. The goalkeepers would participate in special drills whilst training with the rest of the squad. Gunn also notes the influence of Aberdeen coach <a href="Teddy%20Scott">Teddy Scott</a>, who taught the value of hard work and dedication; Gunn also served as a <a href="boot%20boy">boot boy</a> for <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>. Leighton's presence meant that Gunn played only 21 games for Aberdeen. He made his debut against <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> at <a href="Pittodrie%20Stadium">Pittodrie</a> on 30 October 1982, and went on to keep four <a href="clean%20sheets">clean sheets</a> for the club. Despite being rivals for a first-team place, Gunn had an excellent relationship with Leighton that included joining Leighton's family for a meal once a week.

Gunn's training and performances for the reserve team and occasional first-team appearances paid dividends: he was called up for the <a href="Scotland%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Scotland under-21 team</a>, and made his debut in November 1983 against <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">East Germany</a>. He also received <a href="Scottish%20League%20Cup">Scottish League Cup</a> and <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%20Cup">European Cup Winners Cup</a> winner's medals while with Aberdeen, although he was an unused substitute in both finals. He made an unexpected appearance in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20European%20Cup%23Quarter-finals">1986 European Cup quarter final</a>, against <a href="IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg">Gothenburg</a>. "Jim and I were warming up and he lost [his] contact lenses [so] I ended up being included in the starting line up," Gunn recalls. Gunn had an excellent match: "<a href="The%20Glasgow%20Herald">The Glasgow Herald</a>"'s match report stated, "Only outstanding work by <a href="Willie%20Miller">Willie Miller</a> and Bryan Gunn kept the Swedes at bay". As well as making several key saves, he was credited with playing a part in Aberdeen's second goal following a long kick upfield.

As Leighton was unlikely to be dislodged, Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club, and fulfilled his pledge when he sold him for £100,000 to <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> in October 1986. The transfer nearly went through in the summer of 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.

Gunn says of the move south: "Norwich was easy to settle into, a bit like Aberdeen in many ways—a city surrounded by lovely countryside and lots of farms." However, since he joined the club partway into the new season, he initially found it difficult to take over as first-choice goalkeeper. Gunn had been bought as a replacement for England international goalkeeper <a href="Chris%20Woods">Chris Woods</a>, who had moved to <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers F.C.</a> Meanwhile, reserve team keeper <a href="Graham%20Benstead">Graham Benstead</a> made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league. Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait. A 6–2 defeat at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> proved to be the catalyst for Gunn's promotion to the first team. He made his debut in a <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Full Members Cup</a> win against <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>, conceding a penalty, and made his league debut in a 2–1 victory against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986.

Norwich went on to finish <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football%23First%20Division">fifth in the First Division</a> in his first season, their highest-ever league finish at the time. By May 1988 Gunn's consistency meant his value had risen considerably, and the club reportedly declined a £500,000 offer from <a href="Ian%20Porterfield">Ian Porterfield</a> to take the goalkeeper back to Aberdeen. The purpose of the proposed transfer was to replace Leighton, who by then had moved to Manchester United, where he was reunited with Alex Ferguson.

Norwich reached the semi-final of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 1989 with Gunn in goal, but he missed the semi-final in 1992 through injury. What has been described as his—and Norwich's—greatest moment came in their <a href="Bayern%20Munich%20v%20Norwich%20City">upset victory</a> over European giants <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> in 1993. "The Independent" described the match as "the pinnacle of Norwich City's history". Gunn made several saves that kept the Canaries in the match. He describes the save he made from Bayern striker <a href="Adolfo%20Valencia">Adolfo Valencia</a> as the finest of his career; it has also been described as "one of the most outstanding saves by a City goalkeeper". However, he was involved in an <a href="own-goal">own-goal</a> incident in an <a href="East%20Anglian%20derby">East Anglian derby</a> match in the 1995–96 season, when a backpass from <a href="Robert%20Ullathorne">Robert Ullathorne</a> bounced awkwardly off the pitch and over Gunn's attempted clearance kick.
In November 1989, Gunn was involved in a controversial incident that attracted significant media attention. Norwich played <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> at <a href="Highbury%20Stadium">Highbury</a> and with five minutes remaining, Arsenal's <a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a> scored an equaliser that brought the scores to 3–3. Then, in the dying seconds of the match, the referee awarded Arsenal a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>—and the chance to seal the match. The Norwich players were already annoyed by the match situation, and their perception was that the decision was "really dodgy". Gunn saved <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a>'s shot, but the ball was not cleared. In the resulting melee, <a href="Mark%20Bowen%20%28footballer%29">Mark Bowen</a> and <a href="Ian%20Culverhouse">Ian Culverhouse</a> for Norwich and <a href="Alan%20Smith%20%28footballer%20born%201962%29">Alan Smith</a> for Arsenal challenged for the ball. "The three of them got in an almighty tangle and the ball, along with all of them, was bundled over the line," Gunn remembers. The goal was awarded, but the situation rapidly deteriorated: the three players in the goal had "a little skirmish". Separately, Arsenal's <a href="Nigel%20Winterburn">Nigel Winterburn</a> gave "a gloat to <a href="Dale%20Gordon">Dale Gordon</a>, who promptly pushed him". The result was mayhem:
All of a sudden it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not involved were [Arsenal players] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other."

All but one of the 22 players on the pitch were involved in the fracas, but no one was sent off. The next day, the newspapers carried headlines and photos of what they called 'The Highbury Brawl'. That afternoon, Gunn received a phone call from a "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" journalist, who told him that the Arsenal players had said Gunn had instigated the fight. Enraged, the Norwich keeper retorted that it was the other way around. Monday's headline read "Gunn blames Arsenal". Gunn was censured by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> and warned about his future conduct. Both clubs were fined, and Gunn was docked a fortnight's wages (about £800) by Norwich City.

Under the management of <a href="John%20Deehan">John Deehan</a>, Norwich were seventh in the Premier League in the 1994–95 season when Gunn broke and dislocated his ankle whilst playing against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. His importance to the team was underlined when they subsequently plummeted down the table, winning just one of their remaining 17 games as Gunn recovered. The team was ultimately relegated. Gunn retained a regular first team place for the 1995–96 season and, beginning with the match against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on 17 February 1996, began to <a href="captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> the side, initially in the absence of regular captain <a href="Jon%20Newsome">Jon Newsome</a> then on a permanent basis after Newsome left the club. However, when <a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Mike Walker</a> took over as manager for the following 1996–97 season, he appointed <a href="Ian%20Crook">Ian Crook</a> as captain instead.

Gunn's final first-team game for the club was a 1–0 defeat at <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe</a> on 31 January 1998. According to the "<a href="Sunday%20Mirror">Sunday Mirror</a>", he produced "a sparkling display", which proved his abilities had "not been dulled by time". Gunn made 478 first team appearances for Norwich in all competitions. He was voted <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Norwich City Player of the Year</a> in 1988 and 1993. The latter award came at the end of the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93 FA Premier League season</a>, in which Norwich finished third in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, their best-ever performance. The club awarded Gunn a testimonial match in 1996, and Alex Ferguson brought Manchester United to Carrow Road.
In the 1997–98 season, Gunn was forced out of the Norwich team by the emergence of <a href="Andy%20Marshall">Andy Marshall</a>. With his first-team opportunities at Norwich now limited, he signed a deal with Hibernian in February 1998, for a three-month loan. According to Scottish transfer regulations the loan deal was invalid, so instead he was swiftly transferred on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee, later revealed by Gunn to have been £25,000.

Gunn's reflections on joining Hibernian are tinged with regret: "[leaving Norwich was] very difficult indeed. I had spent 12 great years at Norwich and suddenly I was not regarded as the number 1 (by Mike Walker) anymore." He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20Division">Scottish Premier Division</a>; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed <a href="manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a>.

Gunn was unable to save the club from relegation to the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, but signed a two-year contract in July 1998. However, a <a href="hairline%20fracture">hairline fracture</a> to his leg, sustained during the 1998 <a href="close%20season">close season</a>, effectively ended his playing career. On his doctors' advice, Gunn formally retired in March 1999.

Despite his mixed feelings on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression of his time in Edinburgh is upbeat: "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Hearts</a> in my only <a href="Edinburgh%20derby">derby</a> game 2–1 (<a href="John%20Robertson%20%28footballer%20born%201964%29">John Robertson</a> scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but I told him it was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at <a href="Celtic%20Park">Celtic Park</a> (stopping them from winning the <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20Division">SPL</a> that day)." He received what he described as a "wonderful reception" from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.

Gunn represented <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> at the youth international level. He was part of the squad that won the 1982 <a href="UEFA%20European%20Under-19%20Football%20Championship">UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship</a>, but was unavailable to play in the final because Aberdeen had reached the <a href="1982%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final">1982 Scottish Cup Final</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Robin%20Rae">Robin Rae</a> for the final, in which the Scots beat Czechoslovakia 3–1.

In 1983, Gunn travelled with the <a href="Scotland%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">Scotland Under-19s</a> to Mexico for the <a href="1983%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship">1983 FIFA World Youth Championship</a>. Gunn played in all four of Scotland's matches and it was a formative experience, as he faced a variety of challenges in the tournament. The <a href="adidas">adidas</a> ball in use "really zipped through the air", which encouraged long-range shots at the high altitude. In the first match, against <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">South Korea</a>, an element of the 26,000 crowd "clearly didn't like us at all ... I got absolutely pelted with coins ... and rotten fruit". The final insult was when he was hit on the back of the neck by a rancid-smelling plastic bag containing rotten fish. Gunn found it "intimidation ... a nightmare" but adopted the strategy of patrolling the edge of his area to stay out of range and had "one of the best games of my life": he kept a clean sheet as Scotland won 2–0. Scotland's coach and future manager of the full international team <a href="Andy%20Roxburgh">Andy Roxburgh</a> told Gunn "it was the best performance he'd ever seen from a Scottish goalkeeper, at any level." The final group match, which Scotland needed to win in order to progress, was against the home side, <a href="Mexico%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">Mexico</a>. The official attendance at the <a href="Azteca%20Stadium">Azteca Stadium</a> was 86,582, although Gunn believes the true figure was over 100,000. Once more, Gunn was targeted with a variety of missiles, including a bottle of <a href="Johnnie%20Walker">Johnnie Walker</a>, but as Scotland held on to their early 1–0 lead, the fans became disillusioned with their own team and switched to sending a "hail of bottles and coins" on the Mexican players. Scotland lost 1–0 in the quarter final against <a href="Poland%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">Poland</a>.

Gunn made six full international appearances for Scotland, conceding 10 goals. He was a member of the squad for the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 FIFA World Cup</a>, but played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament, as he was third-choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and <a href="Andy%20Goram">Andy Goram</a>. He made his Scotland debut in a pre-tournament <a href="friendly%20match">friendly match</a> against <a href="Egypt%20national%20football%20team">Egypt</a>, but was at fault for two Egyptian goals, resulting in a 3–1 defeat for Scotland. The embarrassment was made worse by the fact that his parents were watching. Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">1994 FIFA World Cup qualification</a> matches. His last <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a> was as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 friendly defeat by the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> in May 1994.


Gunn obtained his <a href="UEFA%20Pro%20Licence">coaching certification</a> while still with Aberdeen, in 1983, at <a href="Largs">Largs</a>. After his retirement from playing professional football in 1999, Gunn initially worked on the hospitality staff at Carrow Road, particularly in "The Gunn Club", a catering outlet named in his honour.

Over the years, Gunn progressed from hospitality into other corporate positions at Norwich; he acted as sponsorship manager from 1999 to 2006. Manager <a href="Peter%20Grant%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29">Peter Grant</a> moved Gunn to the "backroom" sports management side of the business in 2007. Gunn worked in a liaison role in negotiations of possible transfers and loan signings, tasks where he could make use of contacts gained during his playing career.

When <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> was appointed manager in November 2007, goalkeeping coach James Hollman parted company with the club, and Gunn replaced him for the rest of the season—his first formal coaching role. Later in the season, Gunn was promoted to head of player recruitment, while retaining his goalkeeping coach role.

Following the sacking of Roeder as Norwich manager in January 2009, Gunn was asked to take temporary charge of the first team. In an interview with <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Norfolk">BBC Radio Norfolk</a>, he revealed that he "told the players that they've let people down." In his first match as caretaker manager, he received "a euphoric reception" from the fans, and Norwich beat <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> 4–0. The players were equally supportive: according to "<a href="Scotland%20on%20Sunday">Scotland on Sunday</a>", "in the dressing room afterwards, [Norwich] midfielder, <a href="Darel%20Russell">Darel Russell</a>, dragged the chairman, <a href="Roger%20Munby">Roger Munby</a>, into the shower, and demanded that Gunn be appointed permanently." Momentum gathered, and a <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> group called "Bryan Gunn for manager", created by his then 17-year-old daughter, Melissa, soon attracted about 3,000 members. Gunn considered applying for the role on a longer-term basis; he had previously applied without success to be Norwich manager in 1998. On 19 January 2009 he phoned the directors and requested to be considered. He was interviewed that afternoon and "by 10.30 am the next day had been appointed manager until the end of the season".

Gunn appointed a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making <a href="Ian%20Crook">Ian Crook</a> first-team coach and <a href="John%20Deehan">John Deehan</a> chief <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a>. However, the initial turnaround in form could not be maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>. Gunn labelled his players as an "embarrassment" after the 4–2 defeat to <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> that sealed relegation to <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a>. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time in nearly 50 years, Writing in "Tales from the City", Gunn said of the match "Even going to Charlton on the last day, I thought we could survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was."

Relegation changed Gunn's mind about taking the Norwich job. He had decided not to continue in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, "Relegation was a failure and I felt I couldn't quit then. I felt I had to do everything I could to put things right, if I was given the chance. And I was."

Norwich re-appointed Gunn as manager for the 2009–10 season. Crook, as first team coach, and former Canary <a href="Ian%20Butterworth">Ian Butterworth</a>, as assistant manager, completed the management team. Over the summer, Gunn signed 12 players, most of those on free transfers, including Australian <a href="Michael%20Theoklitos">Michael Theoklitos</a>, a goalkeeper from <a href="Melbourne%20Victory%20FC">Melbourne Victory</a>. He then steered the club through a programme of pre-season friendly matches, in which Norwich was unbeaten.

Just under a month after Gunn's reappointment, Norwich appointed a new managing director, <a href="David%20McNally%20%28football%29">David McNally</a>. With the disappointment of relegation, Gunn's reappointment was controversial, and more was to follow. For the opening game of the new season, Norwich were to play at home against <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>, rivals for the <a href="Pride%20of%20Anglia">Pride of Anglia</a>. Gunn's team suffered a 7–1 defeat, and Theoklitos, signed by Gunn on a free transfer, was particularly blamed by the press for the scale of the defeat. Theoklitos later admitted it was "the worst performance of my career". Despite this, he retained Gunn's support, although in the eventuality, Theoklitos never played for Norwich again.

As early as during the match itself, fans and the media began to react strongly to the shock of Norwich's worst-ever home defeat. During the first half, after the side had gone 4–0 down, two supporters approached the Norwich bench, appearing to throw their season tickets at Gunn. Many fans walked out before the match ended, and around 300 people protested outside the ground afterwards. Media coverage of the match was unsurprisingly negative: the BBC used terms such as "calamitous defending", "Colchester run riot", "dismal", and a "disastrous start"; journalists also speculated about Gunn's competence as a manager. Matters seemed to stabilise a little with a 4–0 <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> win at <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil</a> the following Tuesday. However, Gunn was sacked by McNally on 14 August 2009, six days after the defeat by Colchester.

Gunn was influenced in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager <a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Mike Walker</a>. Himself a former goalkeeper, Walker believed—contrary to popular opinion—that goalkeepers can make good managers because their excellent view of the game enables them to develop a good tactical awareness. Gunn's short time at Norwich remains his only experience of professional football management. He says of the time spent as manager that his only regret is that "there must be a generation of fans who only know me as the manager who lost 7-1 against Colchester… My own memories are different."

Gunn began work in November 2009 as director of business development for OneStream, part of the Digital Phone Company, based in <a href="Great%20Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>. His role was to "promote their communication and mobile working solutions".

In 2011, Gunn announced he was leaving OneStream for a new job as a sports agent. In his new role as director of talent recruitment at a sports agency, he is responsible for recruiting young footballers.

Gunn's wife, <a href="Susan%20Gunn">Susan</a>, is a painter. She won the inaugural Sovereign Art Prize in 2008, which included a cash award of €25,000. According to "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", before her marriage, Susan was "a beauty queen turned lingerie model" who "launched a fashion business". The couple met in Spain, where Susan had a bridal wear company, when Gunn was there on holiday. She told the "Telegraph", "When I first met Bryan, I knew nothing about football and had no idea who he was because he told me he was a <a href="joiner">joiner</a>."
Gunn explained that he was unsure what her attitude would be to footballers; he later confessed his calling to her. He proposed within three days of their meeting, and they were married the following year. They lived in <a href="Framingham%20Pigot">Framingham Pigot</a>, near Norwich, until moving to <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> in May 2011, and now live in <a href="Alderley%20Edge">Alderley Edge</a>.

The Gunns have had three children: Francesca, Melissa and <a href="Angus%20Gunn">Angus</a>. Melissa is a model, while Angus is a footballer and plays in goal, like his father. On the books as a youth player at Norwich City, in October 2010 he was selected for <a href="England%20national%20under-16%20football%20team">England under-16s</a>, a full year ahead of the age group. In July 2011, Angus joined <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>; he has "sharp reflexes and strong wrists" and an "ambitious streak". Angus rejoined Norwich on loan in June 2017, and now plays for <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. He also plays for the <a href="England%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21 football team</a>.

According to "<a href="Scotland%20on%20Sunday">Scotland on Sunday</a>", Gunn suffers from <a href="ankylosing%20spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, "a rheumatic spinal condition", diagnosed in about 1995, "which he controls with medication". He appeared in an <a href="ITV2">ITV2</a> celebrity football quiz called "Taking the Pitch" in 1998, alongside singer <a href="Fish%20%28singer%29">Fish</a>. Gunn's autobiography—"In Where it Hurts"—was published in 2006, and includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson. He said of writing the book, "it brought up a lot of good memories and a lot of awkward memories". The book was described by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as "shot through with sharp humour and astute observation". The publishers agreed to donate £1 to Gunn's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold.

In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was diagnosed with <a href="leukaemia">leukaemia</a>. Norwich City fans were at first astonished by the sight of the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head. In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was nothing to be ashamed of. Sorry, Bryan." When news spread of the reason for Gunn's shaven head, he received "support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk".

Gunn describes the period of Francesca's illness and death and how it caused him to reflect on his career:
"We had a charmed life ... then Francesca became ill. There was a game in the autumn of '92 ... that we lost 7–1 at Blackburn. The team stayed in a bleak hotel and it rained endlessly. I just wanted to get back home. With hindsight you think, 'Why the bloody hell was I playing?' Very soon afterwards, Francesca died. She was sleeping between us. I realised what was happening and woke Susan. We cradled Francesca and cried."

Francesca died in 1992, aged two. Gunn played a match for Norwich against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> at Carrow Road just days after his daughter died; he said of it, "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. I never thought about packing it in." At the end of the season, Gunn won <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Player%20of%20the%20Season">Norwich's Player of the Year award</a>, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.

Following Francesca's death, Gunn established "Bryan Gunn's Leukaemia Appeal", a fund to raise money to combat the disease. He initially set a target of £10,000, but by 2011 he has raised £1,000,000, under the auspices of <a href="The%20Dove%20Trust">The Dove Trust</a>. The fund aims to address three issues:

"Equipping local hospitals to be better able to deal with children suffering from the disease on both in-patient and out-patient bases. Providing training for nurses and other staff involved in the care of children with leukaemia over and above that which is available from their employers. To support further research into the causes and cures of leukaemia."

The third of these ambitions has prompted the funding of research into leukaemia at the Norwich-based <a href="University%20of%20East%20Anglia">University of East Anglia</a>. Gunn says:
"The ultimate aim is to find a cure and if that can be done in the laboratory at the University of East Anglia bearing Francesca's name, then it would be the biggest testimony of all. Norwich is now one of the leading centres for leukaemia research and, with links to computer systems around the world, hopefully we'll get there."

In addition to the research, Gunn set up a telephone support line that offers advice and assistance for parents of children who have leukaemia or other forms of cancer. Known as gaps:line (an <a href="acronym">acronym</a> for Gunn Appeal Parent Support), the service quickly grew. From its initial pilot launch in Norfolk in early 2004, it expanded to cover the "eastern region" by the end of the year, and launched nationally in early 2006. The appeal has also funded other research and support work.

As a player, Gunn was described as "a leader with a big presence" by his manager at Hibernian, Alex McLeish. Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson recalls, "the first thing that hit me was his personality. It was abundantly clear ... that he was a warm, outgoing and endearing character", adding "He was a tremendous young keeper... always totally professional and I could never fault his discipline, effort or commitment."

Gunn had a "fantastic rapport with the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to <a href="headbutt">headbutt</a> the <a href="Goal%20%28sport%29%23Association%20football">crossbar</a>. Gunn says this is a habit he began as a youngster, and cannot remember how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small "Wooo..." which would build into a full-blown "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times". During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".

Gunn is described as "a legend in Norwich", the result of his long years of service as player and official for the club. In 2002, he was made one of 25 inaugural members of the <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Norwich City Hall of Fame</a>. A 2005 "<a href="Football%20Focus">Football Focus</a>" fan poll for "Norwich's cult heroes" saw Gunn finish in first place. He polled 37% of votes, ahead of <a href="Robert%20Fleck">Robert Fleck</a> and <a href="Iwan%20Roberts">Iwan Roberts</a>. Gunn is one of just nine players to have twice won <a href="Norwich%20City%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Norwich City Player of the Year</a>, in 1988 and 1993, and the only goalkeeper to do so. In 2003, as part of the <a href="Premier%20League%2010%20Seasons%20Awards">Premier League 10 Seasons Awards</a>, he was one of 10 players to be recognised by the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> with an "Outstanding Contribution to the Community" award. In response to his achievements with Norwich City and his charitable work, which has benefited the local university, in 2002 Gunn was made <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Norwich">Sheriff of Norwich</a> for the year by the City Council.

Congregation Beth Elohim

Congregation Beth Elohim (), also known as the Garfield Temple and the Eighth Avenue Temple, is a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform Jewish</a> congregation located at 274 Garfield Place and Eighth Avenue, in the <a href="Park%20Slope%2C%20Brooklyn">Park Slope</a> neighborhood of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, United States.

Founded in 1861 as a more liberal breakaway from <a href="Congregation%20Baith%20Israel%20Anshei%20Emes">Congregation Baith Israel</a>, for the first 65 years it attempted four mergers with other congregations, including three with Baith Israel, all of which failed. The congregation completed its current <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Classical Revival</a> <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> building in 1910 and its "Jewish Deco" (<a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque Revival</a> and <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>) Temple House in 1929. These two buildings were <a href="contributing%20property">contributing properties</a> to the Park Slope <a href="Historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29">historic district</a>, listed as a <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20City%20Designated%20Landmarks">New York City Landmark district</a> and listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

The congregation went through difficult times during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and the bank almost foreclosed on its buildings in 1946. Membership dropped significantly in the 1930s because of the Depression, grew after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and dropped again in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of demographic shifts. Programs for young children helped draw <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish families back into the neighborhood and revitalize the membership.

By 2006, Beth Elohim had over 1,000 members, and, , it was the largest and most active Reform congregation in Brooklyn, the "oldest Brooklyn congregation that continues to function under its corporate name", and its <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> was the oldest in continuous use in any Brooklyn synagogue. In 2009, it was listed by "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" as one of America's 25 "Most Vibrant" Jewish congregations.

Congregation Beth Elohim was founded on September 29, 1861 by 41 <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Germany">German and Bohemian Jews</a> at Granada Hall on <a href="Myrtle%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Myrtle Avenue</a>, members of <a href="Congregation%20Baith%20Israel%20Anshei%20Emes">Congregation Baith Israel</a> who had become disaffected after they attempted and failed to <a href="Reform%20movement%20in%20Judaism">reform practice</a> there. The synagogue name was chosen by a vote of the membership, and the services were led by George Brandenstein, who served as <a href="Hazzan">cantor</a>, and was paid $150 (today $) a year. Brandenstein was hired as cantor, not <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, because "the congregation believed having a cantor was more important", though in practice he filled both roles. A "<a href="Gabbai">shamash</a>" (the equivalent of a <a href="Sexton%20%28office%29">sexton</a> or <a href="Beadle%23Religious%20beadles">beadle</a>) was also hired for $75 a year.

While searching for a permanent location, the congregation continued to meet and hold services at Granada Hall. Men and women sat together, unlike the <a href="Mechitza%23Separate%20seating%20in%20synagogue">traditional separate seating</a>, and services were conducted in German and <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>. Within a few months, the former Calvary <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Protestant Episcopal</a> <a href="church%20%28building%29">church</a> on Pearl Street, between Nasau and Concord, was purchased for $5,100 (today $) and renovated for another $2,000 (today $). The new building was dedicated on March 30, 1862, and the congregation became known as "the Pearl street synagogue". By 1868, membership had increased to 103, and by 1869, almost 100 students attended the Sunday school.

Beth Elohim had originally conducted its <a href="Jewish%20services">services</a> in the traditional manner, but on February 19, 1870 "inaugurated the moderate reform services" instead. In an attempt to stem defections and make the synagogue more attractive to existing and potential members, that same month the congregation purchased, for $55,000 (today $), the building of the Central <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> Church on Schermerhorn Street near Nevins Street. Sufficient numbers of new members did not, however, materialize, and the congregation was forced to give up its new building, forfeit its $4,000 (today $) deposit, and return to the Pearl Street building. Instead, the Pearl street building was renovated, and an organ and choir added.

Beth Elohim voted to retire Brandenstein in 1882, an action which created some controversy both within the congregation, and among other Brooklyn synagogues. Younger members of the congregation found no specific fault with Brandenstein, but wanted "a change", and succeeded in dismissing him and electing an entirely new board of officers. The final vote was 29 in favor, 21 against, out of a total membership of 53 or 54 (only the male heads of households were counted as members during this era). Solomon Mosche was hired to replace Brandenstein.

In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and <a href="Union%20Temple%20%28Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York%29">Temple Israel</a>, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, attempted an amalgamation. This was the third such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members; members would be refunded half the purchase price of the <a href="pew">pew</a>s in their existing buildings. Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, in the following year the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and a celebration of the 100th birthday of <a href="Moses%20Montefiore">Moses Montefiore</a>. Membership at that time still hovered around 50.

Mosche fell ill in 1884, and after being unable to serve for six months, was replaced by 26-year-old William Sparger. Despite his illness, Mosche lived until age 75, dying on November 3, 1911.

Sparger was <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Hungary">Hungarian</a> by birth, a graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Vienna">Prince Rudolph University of Vienna</a>, and, according to a contemporary "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article, "belong[ed] to the extreme liberal school of Hebrew theology". He introduced changes to the services, including improving the choir, bringing in a new prayer book, adding Friday night services, and the "radical reform" of making the sermon the most important part of the service. He appealed to younger congregants, and, under his direction, the synagogue experienced a large increase in attendance.

Though more seats had been added to the synagogue by narrowing the aisles, as a result of Sparger's innovations Beth Elohim outgrew its Pearl Street building, and a new one was sought. After a three-year search, in 1885 Beth Elohim purchased the building of the Congregational Church at 305 State Street (near Hoyt) for $28,000 (today $), and moved in that year.

In 1891, <a href="Congregation%20Emanu-El%20of%20New%20York">Temple Emanu-El</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> offered Sparger a salary larger than Beth Elohim could match, and he moved there. Beth Elohim subsequently split the offices of cantor and rabbi, hiring G. Taubenhaus as rabbi and the Mauritz Weisskopf as cantor.

Born in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Taubenhaus could read the <a href="Chumash%20%28Judaism%29">Pentateuch</a> fluently in Hebrew at age four, and began studying the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> at age six. He attended the "Berlin theological seminary" (likely the <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20die%20Wissenschaft%20des%20Judentums">Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums</a>) for six years. Upon emigrating to the United States, he served at Kehillah 
Kodesh Bene Yeshurum in <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah, Kentucky</a>, <a href="Temple%20Israel%20%28Dayton%2C%20Ohio%29">Temple Israel</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, and <a href="Congregation%20B%27nai%20Israel%20%28Sacramento%2C%20California%29">Congregation B'nai Israel</a> in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, before becoming the rabbi of the Shaari Zedek ("Gates of Hope") synagogue in New York. Differences with the latter congregation led to his resignation there shortly before being hired by Beth Elohim. Taubenhaus's brother Joseph would be appointed rabbi at Baith Israel, Beth Elohim's parent congregation, in 1893, and another brother, Jacob/<a href="Jean%20Taubenhaus">Jean Taubenhaus</a>, was a famous French <a href="chess%20master">chess master</a>.

By the time of Taubenhaus's hiring, Beth Elohim was, according to the "Brooklyn Eagle", "recognized as the leading Hebrew synagogue of Brooklyn". The views of the congregation regarding "<a href="kashrut">kashrut</a>" (the Jewish dietary laws) were by then quite liberal; in 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Jacob%20Ohev%20Sholom">Beth Jacob synagogue</a> for <a href="Kosher%20animals">eating ham</a>, Taubenhaus stated that he did not believe his congregation would expel him for doing the same.

In 1895, Samuel Radnitz succeeded Weisskopf as cantor, a role he filled until his death in 1944.

By the turn of the twentieth century English had replaced German in the services and official minutes, and the second days of <a href="Jewish%20holiday">holidays</a> eliminated. The synagogue had 106 members and annual revenues of around $8,000 (today $), and its <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> had approximately 300 pupils.

Taubenhaus left the congregation in 1901, and the following year Alexander Lyons was hired as the congregation's first American-born rabbi. Lyons went on to serve the congregation for 37 years, until his death in 1939 at the age of 71.

In 1907, the women's auxiliary was founded; until then, though seating was mixed, women had little say in the running of the synagogue. That year the congregation had 110 member families and annual revenues of $9,259.55 (today $). The congregational school, which held classes one day a week, had 15 teachers and 200 students.

In 1908, the congregation purchased a by lot on the northeast corner of Garfield Place and Eighth Avenue. Plans were made to erect a new synagogue building there with a sanctuary seating 1,500 people, at an anticipated cost of $100,000 (today $). The structure was designed and built by the Manhattan architectural firm of Simon Eisendrath and B. Horowitz (or Horwitz). Construction began in 1909 and completed in 1910. Designed in the <a href="Neoclassicism">Classical Revival</a> style, this "monumental example" of "austere neo-Classical grandeur" had five sides, representing the <a href="Pentateuch">five books of Moses</a>, a sanctuary that ultimately sat 1,200, and was capped by a saucer <a href="dome">dome</a>. The entrance faced the corner of Garfield and Eighth, and carved in stone over it was the Biblical verse fragment (). The basement held classrooms, an auditorium, and administrative offices, and behind the <a href="Torah%20ark">Torah ark</a> was a combination Rabbi's study/Board meeting room. The State Street building was sold to Congregation Mount Sinai.

1909 was also the year <a href="Judah%20Leon%20Magnes">Judah Leon Magnes</a> proposed and founded his "Kehilla", a "comprehensive communal organization for the Jews of New York", which operated until 1922. Lyons opposed its creation, arguing that Jews in New York were too diverse to co-exist in one organization with a single set of standards, that Jews should not organize as Jews for anything except purely religious purposes, and that in any event Reform Judaism was the future and <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> would not survive. As Lyons put it,
To me Reform Judaism is an irresistible conviction. I believe it to be the religion of the Jewish future, while I regard orthodoxy as a survival that may have a galvanized life now and then, but on the whole is doomed.

By 1919, Beth Elohim had 133 member families. The congregational school, which held classes once a week, had 305 students and 16 teachers.

Negotiations to merge with <a href="Union%20Temple%20%28Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York%29">Union Temple</a> (the successor to Temple Israel) were started in 1925. A confirmation vote eventually passed, and the impending merger was announced in the "<a href="Brooklyn%20Eagle">Brooklyn Eagle</a>". However, younger congregants feared a loss of identity, and forced a withdrawal.

Instead, the congregation raised funds for a second building, and in 1928–1929 built the six-story Temple House (used for all congregational activities) on the corner opposite the main sanctuary. Designed by Mortimer Freehof and David Levy, the <a href="cast%20stone">cast stone</a> building's <a href="architectural%20style">architectural style</a> was "Jewish Deco", a mix of <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque Revival</a> and <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> decorative forms that was common in Jewish buildings of the period. Romanesque features included the <a href="wikt%3Afenestration">fenestration</a>s, while a prominent Art Deco feature was "the figure of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and the <a href="Tablets%20of%20stone">Tablets of Law</a>, emphasizing the corner of the roof <a href="parapet">parapet</a>." The doorway and balcony at the east end of the building had "a distinctly <a href="Moorish%20Revival">Moorish</a> flavor, featuring symbolic ornament: the <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a>, the <a href="Menorah%20%28Temple%29">Menorah</a>, and the <a href="Lion%20of%20Judah">Lion of Judah</a>." The names of major figures from the "<a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>" (<a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>) were inscribed on the Garfield Place <a href="facade">facade</a>, and the Biblical verses "" () on the Eighth Avenue facade. The building was also decorated with <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s of <a href="Jonah%23The%20story%20of%20Jonah">Jonah being swallowed by a great fish</a> and <a href="Chariot%23Chariots%20in%20the%20Bible">Babylonian charioteers</a>. It housed a 125-seat chapel, a large ballroom, social halls, class rooms for the religious school, meeting rooms, administrative offices, a library, handball courts, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.

Lyons took on a number of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a> <a href="David%20Hummell%20Greer">David Greer</a> and Rabbi <a href="Stephen%20Samuel%20Wise">Stephen Wise</a> to expose conditions in <a href="New%20York%20State%20Tenement%20House%20Act">New York's tenements</a>, dissociated himself from <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a> candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for <a href="Leo%20Frank">Leo Frank</a>, and opposed some of the views of <a href="Samuel%20Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>. In 1912, Lyons was a founding member of the Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern United States</a> that was created despite opposition from the <a href="Central%20Conference%20of%20American%20Rabbis">Central Conference of Reform Rabbis</a>. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> victory in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>) and asked that his contributed funds be donated instead to the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt politicization of the event, and its control by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>.

<a href="Isaac%20Landman">Isaac Landman</a>, a graduate of <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a>, joined Lyons as rabbi of Beth Elohim in 1931. Born in Russia in 1880, Landman had come to the United States in 1890. In 1911, with the assistance of <a href="Jacob%20Schiff">Jacob Schiff</a>, <a href="Julius%20Rosenwald">Julius Rosenwald</a>, and <a href="Simon%20Bamberger">Simon Bamberger</a>, he founded a Jewish farm colony in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, and during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> he was "said to be the first Jewish <a href="Military%20Chaplain">chaplain</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> to serve on foreign soil". A leader in <a href="Christian%E2%80%93Jewish%20reconciliation">Jewish–Christian ecumenism</a>, he was editor of "American Hebrew Magazine" from 1918, served as the delegate of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now <a href="Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Union for Reform Judaism</a>) to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">1919 Paris Peace Conference</a>, and in the late 1930s and early 1940s was editor of the new ten volume "<a href="Universal%20Jewish%20Encyclopedia">Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</a>".

Landman had also been a prominent opponent of <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>: when, in 1922, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> was considering the Lodge–Fish resolution in support of the <a href="Balfour%20Declaration%20of%201917">Balfour Declaration</a>, Landman and Rabbi <a href="David%20Philipson">David Philipson</a> had presented the Reform movement's (then) <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a> position to the <a href="House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">House Committee on Foreign Affairs</a>. Landman also printed many opinions against the resolution and Zionism in his "American Hebrew Magazine". The bill was eventually unanimously supported by both houses of Congress, and approved by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Harding</a>.

During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> synagogue membership decreased significantly; experiencing financial difficulties, the congregation stopped paying its mortgage. Nevertheless, Beth Elohim was not completely moribund; in 1931 it opened its Academy of Adult Jewish Education, which "offered courses in Bible, religion and contemporary Jewish life", and operated throughout the Depression. By 1937 the congregation had elected Lyons "rabbi for life".

In 1938 Lyons made common cause with Thomas Harten, the black pastor of Holy Trinity Baptist Church. Speaking to a mixed black–Jewish audience at the church, Lyons informed the listeners that he was planning to attend the second <a href="Joe%20Louis%20versus%20Max%20Schmeling">Joe Louis versus Max Schmeling</a> <a href="boxing">boxing</a> match in order to protest <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s "view that a bout between a German and a Negro was improper". Lyons denounced the <a href="Nazism%20and%20race">Nazi racial ideas</a>, which he noted discriminated against blacks as well as Jews, and encouraged the audience to boycott all German-made goods until "Hitler comes to his senses".

Lyons died the following year, and Landman served as sole rabbi. After his death, the Central Conference of American Rabbis described Lyons as the "dean of the Brooklyn rabbinate from the point of view of service".

The synagogue's fortunes improved in the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, in anticipation of their sale to the local <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Catholic</a> <a href="diocese">diocese</a>, as the congregation had not paid the mortgage in many years. The congregation succeeded in convincing the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.

Eugene Sack, the father of <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit">Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a> <a href="judge">judge</a> <a href="Robert%20D.%20Sack">Robert D. Sack</a>, joined Landman as rabbi in 1946. While serving as assistant rabbi of <a href="Congregation%20Rodeph%20Shalom%20%28Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Congregation Rodeph Shalom of Philadelphia</a>, Sack had been instrumental in the founding of the Reform movement's <a href="North%20American%20Federation%20of%20Temple%20Youth">National Federation of Temple Youth</a> in 1939, and had presented a paper at its first biennial convention. Starting in 1943 he spent 18 months in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater of Operations</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as an <a href="Chaplain%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">army chaplain</a>; at one point he had to substitute peach juice for <a href="Passover%23Four%20cups%20of%20wine">Passover wine</a>.

Sack had also previously been involved in anti-Zionist efforts amongst the Reform rabbinate. In 1942 the Central Conference of American Rabbis had abandoned its former anti-Zionist stance, and adopted a resolution favoring the creation of a Jewish army in Palestine, to fight alongside other <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied armies</a>, and under Allied command. Sack and other prominent Reform rabbis opposed this; meeting on March 18, 1942, they agreed "there was a need to revitalize Reform Judaism, to oppose Jewish nationalism, and to publicize their point of view". They planned "for a meeting of non-Zionist Reform Rabbis to discuss the problems that confront Judaism and Jews in the world emergency", to be held in <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a>. 36 rabbis eventually attended the two-day conference on June 1, 1942, including Beth Israel's Landman. The conference led to the formation of the anti-Zionist <a href="American%20Council%20for%20Judaism">American Council for Judaism</a>, "the only American Jewish organization ever formed for the specific purpose of fighting Zionism and opposing the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine."

Landman died suddenly in 1946, leaving Sack to head Beth Elohim alone; Sack would eventually serve as rabbi for 35 years. Richard Harvey also joined as cantor in the 1940s; he would serve until his death in the 1970s.

After the war, Beth Elohim allowed women to become full members, granting them full voting privileges and allowing them to hold office. The congregation subsequently elected Jeanette Marks as a trustee. At this time the origins of the membership began to change, as Jews of Eastern European descent started joining the congregation.

In the late 1940s the central vault ceiling of the main sanctuary cracked, and had to be repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of <a href="check%20valve">check valve</a>s, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.

By 1953, Beth Elohim had grown to over 700 families, and the religious school had over 550 students. In the 1960s, however, membership began to decline, as young families moved to the suburbs.

In 1970, the congregation again encountered difficulties, "faced with dwindling membership and bleak prospects". The members, however, created one of the earliest <a href="nursery%20school">nursery school</a>s in the neighborhood, which, along with the Brownstone Revival movement in Park Slope, helped draw Jewish families back into the temple and revitalize the membership. One of those young families was that of Gerald I. Weider, a young rabbi who joined the synagogue's staff in 1978.

A native of <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, Weider graduated from <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a>, and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1973 (he would be granted a Doctor of Divinity degree by Hebrew Union College in 1998). Before joining Beth Elohim, he served as Assistant Rabbi of <a href="Temple%20Ohabei%20Shalom%20%28Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Temple Ohabei Shalom</a> of Brookline, Massachusetts, and as the Associate Rabbi of <a href="Washington%20Hebrew%20Congregation">Washington Hebrew Congregation</a> in Washington, D.C. At Beth Elohim, he focused on programming and services for urban Jewish families. Under his leadership, Beth Elohim opened after–school and early childhood centers in 1978, and a day camp the following year, all housed in the Temple House.

The 1970s also saw a return to more traditional practices in the service, under Weider's guidance. Some members began wearing <a href="kippah">head coverings</a> in the sanctuary, some Hebrew prayers were added to the Sabbath service, and the Reform movement's new <a href="High%20Holy%20Days">High Holy Days</a> prayer book "The Gates of Repentance" was adopted. The synagogue building and Temple House were <a href="contributing%20property">contributing properties</a> to the Park Slope <a href="Historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29">historic district</a>, which was listed as a <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20City%20Designated%20Landmarks">New York City Landmark district</a> in 1973, and added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1980.

In 1985, Weider and Beth Elohim, in cooperation with the rabbis of the <a href="Park%20Slope%20Jewish%20Center">Park Slope Jewish Center</a> and <a href="Congregation%20Baith%20Israel%20Anshei%20Emes">Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes</a>, proposed opening a liberal <a href="Jewish%20day%20school">Jewish day school</a> in Brooklyn. Though housed at Beth Elohim, it would not be affiliated with any specific Jewish movement, and was intended for children from all branches of Judaism. Planning began in earnest in 1994; the school was modeled on New York's <a href="Abraham%20Joshua%20Heschel%20School">Abraham Joshua Heschel School</a>, as an outgrowth of Beth Elohim's <a href="Preschool%20education">preschool program</a>. The intent was to start with only first grade in 1995, but extend to eighth grade by 2000. At the time Beth Elohim had approximately 500 member families and 141 children in the preschool. The school opened in 1995, and continued for three years, growing to 38 students, before moving to new premises and becoming independent under the name "Hannah Senesh Community Day School".

In the 1980s and 1990s Beth Elohim's buildings were repaired and refurbished a number of times. The sanctuary ceiling cracked in the early 1980s, and services were held in Temple House for a time. The congregation mounted a "Save our Sanctuary" campaign in 1982, and repaired the ceiling. In the 1980s Beth Elohim also refurbished the Moses stained glass window, and painted the main sanctuary. The congregation restored and renovated its buildings in 1990, and in 1992 did emergency restoration work to the facade of Temple House and restored the pews. In 1997 the synagogue began its "Kadimah Capital Campaign", which was intended to raise funds to repair and renovate the buildings. By 1999, the congregation had restored Temple House's facade, rebuilt the collapsed Garfield St. entrance, made entry into the synagogue handicapped accessible, added a multipurpose space and classrooms in the basement of the sanctuary, and planned to add a fifth floor for more classrooms. That year Sack (by then Rabbi Emeritus) died; the year before his death his son, Robert, at his induction as a Second Circuit judge, had described his father as "the most open minded man he had ever known".

Janet Leuchter joined as cantor in 2001. A native of Vineland, New Jersey, and 1999 graduate of Hebrew Union College, she had previously served as cantor of Temple Avodah in Oceanside, New York.

Weider retired as senior rabbi in 2006, after 28 years of service. He was succeeded by Andy Bachman. At that time, Beth Elohim had over 500 members. In 2007, the synagogue was a winner of the <a href="Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Union for Reform Judaism</a>'s Congregation of Learners award for medium size synagogues, for "those synagogues that provide an exceptional environment of varied and comprehensive learning opportunities and have imbued their synagogue communities with a culture of learning".

In 2009, Beth Elohim was described as the largest and most active Reform congregation in Brooklyn. Prominent members included <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Chuck%20Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a>. In April of that year, Beth Elohim was listed by "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" as one of America's 25 "Most Vibrant" Jewish congregations. In September, just four days before <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>, a part of the sanctuary ceiling collapsed. No-one was hurt, but the sanctuary had to be closed. The nearby Old First Reformed Church—with which Beth Elohim had had close ties since the 1930s—offered its premises for the holiday (Sunday night and Monday), and accommodated over 1000 worshipers. The day before the holiday, the synagogue was picketed by members of the <a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>, who shouted antisemitic and anti-gay slogans.

, Beth Elohim was the "oldest Brooklyn congregation that continues to function under its corporate name", and its <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> was the oldest in continuous use in any Brooklyn synagogue. Its rabbis were Andy Bachman, Shira Koch Epstein, and Marc Katz, the rabbi emeritus was Gerald Weider, and the cantor was Joshua Breitzer.

Bachman, a graduate of <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> with a 1996 rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College, became Beth Elohim's first new senior rabbi in 25 years on October 25, 2006. Before becoming senior rabbi he had previously been an educator there from 1993 to 1998. An advocate of more traditionalism in the Reform movement, in 2002 he started a small, more traditional, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>-focused spinoff <a href="minyan">prayer group</a> at Beth Elohim, and has spoken in favor of a more traditional liturgy. Bachman and his wife, Rachel Altstein, have been instrumental in bringing 20- and 30-year-olds into the synagogue, and in December 2007, Bachman was named one of "<a href="The%20Forward">The Forward</a>"'s "Forward 50". In 2008 he was a regular contributor to the <a href="Washingtonpost.Newsweek%20Interactive">Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive</a> website. Epstein, born in the Bronx and raised in <a href="New%20Milford%2C%20Connecticut">New Milford, Connecticut</a>, attended <a href="Wesleyan%20University">Wesleyan University</a> and Hebrew Union College, and served as the coordinator of the Institute for Reform Zionism. In 2008 she was a member of "Rabbis for Obama", a <a href="Jewish%20religious%20movements">cross-denominational</a> group of more than 300 American rabbis supporting <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008 presidential campaign</a>. Barrington Rhode Island native Marc Katz graduated from <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a> and studied at Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem before becoming Beth Elohim's rabbinic intern in 2009. He currently serves as the congregation's Associate Rabbi.

On September 22, 2013, Beth Elohim celebrated its 150th anniversary and dedicated a new "<a href="Sefer%20Torah">Sefer Torah</a>". Members of Beth Elohim stated it was "the first Torah in New York City to be completed by a woman".

In June 2015, Andy Bachman departed to join the 92nd Street Y as the Director of Jewish Content and Community Ritual, and in addition, he founded "Water Over Rocks," a non-profit dedicated to memory and civic responsibility. In July 2015, Rachel Timoner became the Senior Rabbi.

Little Tich

Harry Relph (21 July 1867 – 10 February 1928), professionally known as Little Tich, was a tall English <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> comedian and dancer during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was best known for his acrobatic and comedic Big-Boot Dance, which he performed in Europe and for which he wore boots with soles long. Aside from his music hall appearances, he was also a popular performer in Christmas <a href="pantomimes">pantomimes</a> and appeared in them annually at theatres throughout the English provinces. He repeated this success in London, where he appeared in three pantomimes at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> between 1891 and 1893 alongside <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a> and <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a>.

Born in <a href="Cudham">Cudham</a>, Kent, Little Tich began performing aged ten when he developed a dance and tin-whistle act which he showcased at public houses in <a href="Sevenoaks">Sevenoaks</a>. In the early 1880s he formed a <a href="blackface">blackface</a> act and gained popularity with performances at the nearby <a href="Rosherville%20Gardens">Rosherville Pleasure Gardens</a> and Barnard's Music Hall in <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham</a>. He travelled to London and appeared at the Forester's Music Hall in 1884. Later that year, he adopted the stage name "Little Tich", which he based on his childhood nickname of "Tichborne", acquired through his portly stature and physical likeness to the suspected <a href="Tichborne%20case">Tichborne Claimant</a> <a href="Arthur%20Orton">Arthur Orton</a>. The terms "titchy" or "titch" were later derived from "Little Tich", and are used to describe things that are small.

Little Tich's act matured during a tour of the United States between 1887 and 1889 where he established the Big-Boot Dance and impressed audiences with his ability to stand on the tips of the shoes and to lean at extraordinary angles. In the 1890s he developed the Serpentine Dance and had a major success with the Christmas pantomime "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>" in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> during the 1889–90 season. In 1891, he was recruited by the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a> to appear in that years spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "Humpty Dumpty". He starred in a further two productions at the theatre including "Little Bo Peep" (1892) and "Robinson Crusoe" (1893).
Between 1896 and 1902 Little Tich performed in his own musical theatre company, and spent much of his time in Paris, where he became a popular variety artist. For his music hall acts, he created characters based on everyday observations. The characterisations used were "The Gas Inspector", "The Spanish Señora" and "The Waiter"; all three were later recorded onto <a href="Gramophone%20record">shellac</a> discs, of which he made twenty in total. He was married three times and fathered two children. In 1927 he suffered a stroke, which was partly triggered by a blow to the head which he had accidentally received during an evening performance at the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra Theatre</a>. He never recovered fully from the injury, and died the following year at his house in <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>, aged 60.

Little Tich was born Harry Relph in <a href="Cudham">Cudham</a>, Kent (now in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Bromley">London Borough of Bromley</a>). He was the last of eight children born to Richard Relph (1790–1881), a farmer and publican, and his wife Mary, <a href="Married%20and%20maiden%20names">"née"</a> Moorefield (1835–1893). The Relph family were close and lived in relative affluence. Richard Relph was a committed family man and was known in the village for his sharp business acumen. His early wealth, which was attributed to a series of successful horse-trading deals, enabled him to purchase his first public house, the Rising Sun in <a href="Fawkham">Fawkham</a>. In 1818 he married Sarah Ashenden and they had eight children; she died in 1845. In 1851 he moved to Cudham, bought the Blacksmith's Arms and an adjoining farm, and started a new family with the 32-year-old Mary Moorefield, a <a href="Governess">nurse-maid governess</a> from <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. 
Little Tich was born with an <a href="polydactyly">extra digit on each hand</a>, <a href="Syndactyly">webbed</a> from the little finger to the centre joint. He also experienced <a href="stunted%20growth">stunted growth</a>. He reached in height by the age of ten, but grew no taller. His physical differences from other children caused him to become socially withdrawn and lonely. Nevertheless, his disabilities earned him fame and were an asset to his parents' business. Patrons would travel from neighbouring counties to witness his peculiarities, and the youngster revelled in the attention, dancing comically on his father's saloon bar to curious guests.
Little Tich was educated at <a href="Knockholt">Knockholt</a>, a three-mile walk from Cudham. From an early age, he displayed considerable academic ability and also excelled in art; by the time he was five, his drawings were being sold to patrons of the Blacksmith's Arms by his father. Little Tich became interested in the travelling performers whom his father often employed to entertain guests at the inn. He would mimic the dancers, singers and conjurors, causing much amusement to both his family and patrons. So good were his impersonations that his siblings frequently took him to neighbouring public houses where they would get him to perform in exchange for money. These experiences prepared Little Tich for his future career. As a result of what he saw, he, like his father, became a strict teetotaller in later years, and showed a deep loathing for boisterous and intoxicated people. Little Tich revelled in his local celebrity status; however, the older he got the more self-conscious he became and wrongly interpreted the audience's laughter as being aimed more at his disabilities rather than his comical performances.

Richard Relph sold the Blacksmith's Arms and the adjoining farm in 1875 and moved his family to <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a>. The socially withdrawn Little Tich was forced to adapt to much busier surroundings; day-trippers, holidaymakers and fishermen often frequented the streets and occupied the plethora of public houses which adorned the port and neighbouring roads. He resumed his education, this time at Christ Church School, where he spent the next three years. In 1878 the headmaster deemed him too educationally advanced for the school, and Richard Relph was advised to secure for his young son a <a href="Watchmaker">watchmaking</a> apprenticeship instead; Relph ignored the advice.

By 1878 Little Tich's parents were unable to financially provide for him further and he sought full-time employment as a lather boy in a barber's shop in Gravesend. One evening, together with a friend whose brother was appearing in a talent contest, he visited a <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> for the first time and quickly became "hooked" on the idea of being able to perform. Thanks largely to his local celebrity status of being a "freak", he was welcomed into the many public houses which catered for soldiers, sailors, merchant seamen and day-trippers from London.

By 1878, Little Tich had saved enough money to buy himself a <a href="tin%20whistle">tin whistle</a> which he used to "amuse [him]self by playing all the jolly and sentimental <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> songs of the day". To earn money, he began <a href="busking">busking</a> to local theatre goers who were waiting in the outside queues. On the way home from his busking performances, he devised eccentric dances, much to the amusement of his onlooking neighbours. Little Tich made his stage debut as Harry Relph at the age of 12 in 1879. The venue—although unidentified—was described by his daughter Mary as being a "back-street, free-and-easy" where the acts were predominantly made up of amateurs and beginners. The audiences were often harsh and they would display their displeasure by throwing objects onto the stage.

One evening, having exhausted the list of amateur talent, the compere called on Little Tich and his tin-whistle to take up the next turn. The performance was a success and Little Tich returned every night, often accompanying his tin-whistle piece with impromptu dance routines. News of his performances spread, and he was soon signed up by the proprietor of the neighbouring Royal Exchange music hall, who bought his new signing a pair of <a href="Clog%20%28shoe%29">clogs</a>. Little Tich became a popular draw at the hall and often sang thirty songs a night. It was here that he discovered the art of <a href="blackface">blackface</a>, a popular type of entertainment widely performed around the British Isles at that time.

At the start of the 1880s, Little Tich assumed the stage name "The Infant Mackney" and graduated to the world of open-air theatre. The following year, he joined a blackface troupe who performed regularly at the <a href="Rosherville%20Gardens">Rosherville Pleasure Gardens</a>; the local historian J.R.S. Clifford described them as "a band of minstrel darkies of a superior type". Little Tich's transition from amateur to professional performer came when he appeared in a weekly spot at Barnard's Music Hall in <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham</a>. Lew Barnard, the hall's proprietor, offered him 35 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s a week. Thrilled at the prospect of appearing in a proper music hall, Little Tich changed his name from The Infant Mackney to Young Tichborne, a nickname he had gained while living in Cudham years earlier. He enjoyed initial success at Barnard's, but audience numbers soon diminished and his pay was reduced to 15 shillings a week as a result. To supplement his income, he resumed his position in the barber's shop and took on a string of menial jobs that lasted six months.

In 1881 Little Tich left home with his sister Agnes, who chaperoned her young brother around the music halls and variety clubs throughout England. By now, he had swapped the tin-whistle for a <a href="picco%20pipe">picco pipe</a> which he used to accompany his clog dancing routine. He despised his early experiences of provincial touring as he was often forced to sleep in <a href="Flophouse">dosshouses</a> with very little money or food. To survive, he would often return to busking outside music halls to the waiting audiences. In the early months of 1884, he secured an engagement at a rundown public house called The Dolphin in <a href="Kidderminster">Kidderminster</a>, where he was paid £2 a week. He also hired his first agent who, unbeknown to Little Tich, had advertised him as a "freak" and a "six-fingered novelty". The comedian was furious with the description and quickly dispensed with the agent's services. By the summer months, his engagements had become infrequent so he used the long periods of unemployment constructively. He learned how to read and write music and taught himself to play various musical instruments including the piano, <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a> and cello. He also mastered dancing in big boots.
In November 1884 he changed his stage name for the third time to Little Tich, which derived from Tichborne, and "Tich" or "Tichy" became a common term meaning small. His reasoning for the name change was to capitalise on the release of the Tichborne claimant fraudster <a href="Arthur%20Orton">Arthur Orton</a> who was then touring the British Isles in the hope of reopening the case. The change of name also coincided with the signing of a new agent who was known in London for being "one of the brightest and youngest in [show]business". The agent, Edward Colley (1859–1889), was equally thrilled with the acquisition of a new star and secured him a double engagement at the Marylebone Music Hall where he appeared as "Little Titch, The Most Curious Comique in Creation" and immediately after at the Forester's Music Hall, where he was billed as "Little Titch, the Funny Little Nigger". A reporter for "<a href="The%20Era%20%28newspaper%29">The Era</a>" predicted "We shall probably hear a great deal more about Little Titch, as he seems to be one of the few that can invest the business of the Negro comedian with any humour."

By Christmas 1884, Little Tich was a resident performer in four London music halls: the <a href="New%20London%20Theatre">Middlesex Music Hall</a> where he had an 8 pm billing, the Marylebone (at 9 pm), the Star Palace of Varieties in <a href="Bermondsey">Bermondsey</a> (at 10 pm), and Crowders Music Hall in <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a> (at 11 pm). Out of the four halls, he had the most success at the Marylebone and fulfilled a ten-week run. A critic for "The Era" who witnessed him perform at the Marylebone thought that he was "a curious comic" and that "his antics, his sayings and his business generally [were] very amusing, and he will doubtless improve in his singing, which is weak at present, even for a Negro delineator". The commentator further noted that "he appear[ed] to be quite a young man at present; but his dancing is peculiarly funny, though his dress in one of his characters is vulgar and suggestive; this should be altered".

Having been a success in London for nearly a year, Little Tich travelled to Scotland to appear in pantomime for the first time during the 1885–86 Christmas season. "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%23Stage%20and%20film">Robinson Crusoe</a>" opened at the <a href="Citizens%20Theatre">Royal Princess Theatre</a> in Glasgow and he appeared in the small role of Chillingowadaborie, a black-faced attendant for one of the main characters King Tum-tum. The following Christmas, Little Tich starred for a second time in pantomime, this time at the <a href="Pavilion%20Theatre%2C%20Whitechapel">Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel</a> in a production of "<a href="Cinderella%23Theatre">Cinderella</a>" in which he played "King Mischief".

The American impresario <a href="Tony%20Pastor">Tony Pastor</a> came to England in 1886 and signed Little Tich for a tour of the United States. Pastor had seen the comedian perform at a small music hall called Gatti's-in-the-Road near to <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> and was recruiting for his Gaiety Theatre Company. Little Tich left for America in the early months of 1887 and assumed his first role for Pastor in a <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> version of "<a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre-Dame">The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</a>", playing the lead character for a fee of £10 a week. Later, during a successful run in a parody of Louis Bertin's opera "<a href="La%20Esmeralda%20%28opera%29">La Esmeralda</a>", he impressed audiences with his "Big-Boot Dance", and Pastor engaged his new star for a further two seasons in the mock-opera which had a total run of nine months. To show his appreciation for the record profits and huge audience attendances, Pastor presented Little Tich with a gold medal and a rare white <a href="Bohemian%20Shepherd">Bohemian Shepherd</a> dog which the comedian called Cheri.

Little Tich's success under Pastor brought him to the attention of the Chicago State Opera Company, who secured him on a two-year contract for a fee of $150 a week. Before the contract commenced, he was allowed to travel back to England where he honoured a pantomime commitment by appearing in "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington</a>" at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Brighton">Theatre Royal</a> in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>. In the piece he took the billing of "Tiny Titch" and played the Emperor Muley. In June 1888, at the <a href="Chicago%20Opera%20House">Chicago Opera House</a>, Little Tich starred in "The Crystal Slipper", a burlesque loosely based on "Cinderella"; the production was a hit for the comedian and completed a run of over ten months. "The Era" described him as "the quaint little Negro comedian" and called his American engagement "brilliantly successful". During "The Crystal Slipper", Little Tich met the English dancer Laurie Brooks, whom he married in <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois">Cook County, Illinois</a> on 20 January 1889. That year marked the end of Little Tich's "blacking up" routine, which he had performed in between his commitments for the Chicago State Opera Company. He was told by a producer that the American audiences would find the black face and English accent too much of a contrast and opined "a deaf mute with one eye could see you aint a coon". Little Tich initially became worried at the prospect of appearing on stage without make-up, but found that the audience approved of the change.
As the months progressed, the tour matured and news of his performances travelled across America. To compensate for the loss of his blackface act, Little Tich perfected his Big-Boot Dance instead and swapped from boots which he found more suitable for his size. He had also mastered a <a href="List%20of%20quick-change%20acts">quick change</a> into the novelty footwear which he could perform in minutes. One stage director became concerned that the pause was too long for the audience to wait, and he threw the boots onto the stage causing the star to run back out in front of the waiting audience to put the boots on in front of them. While he did this, the orchestra provided an accompaniment of <a href="Ostinato%23Vamp">"till ready"</a> music. For the audience, this provided much hilarity and they assumed it was part of the act. The unintentional sketch was "an instant hit" and the comedian incorporated this into his future Big-Boot Dance routine.

In April 1889 Little Tich briefly returned to London to star at the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire Theatre in Leicester Square</a> where he was poorly received by audiences. As a result, the manager of the theatre reduced the comedian's wages to £6 a week. The experience left him bitter towards the English entertainment industry and he returned to America to appear in a new production for the Chicago State Opera. The production, "Bluebeard Junior", was not as successful as its predecessor, but toured for seven months. Despite his bad reviews back in England, Little Tich began to feel homesick and he was allowed to return home a few months short of his contract expiration. Once back, he and his wife set up home at 182 Kennington Road, <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>; Laurie later gave birth to the couple's son Paul on 7 November 1889.

In the later months of 1889 Little Tich secured an engagement at the London Pavilion in <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a>. This time, he found his English critics to be complimentary about his talent, but as their praise was largely about his success in America, he considered them hypocritical. News of his much-improved performances travelled throughout the country and he was visited by Thomas W. Charles, manager of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>'s <a href="Prince%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Manchester">Prince's Theatre</a>. Charles offered Little Tich a leading role in his forthcoming pantomime "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>". The 1889–90 production was a huge success for the comedian and his performance reportedly earned him "the heartiest applause of the evening".

By the early months of 1890, <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a>, the influential manager of the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, had travelled to Manchester to look for new talent for his theatre's forthcoming 1890–91 pantomime. Impressed with what he saw, he offered the comedian a theatrical residency at Drury Lane but he was forced to withdraw it as Little Tich was contracted to Charles for a further year; Harris instead signed Little Tich for a two-year contract starting the following season. The deal required Little Tich to star in two pantomimes for a wage of £36 a week. Following on from his success in "Babes in the Wood" which culminated in April 1890, the theatre manager Rollo Balmain cast him as <a href="Quasimodo">Quasimodo</a> in a production of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Plymouth">Theatre Royal, Plymouth</a>. The show featured a burlesque centrepiece which required Little Tich to dress as a ballerina and gave him the opportunity to perform two of his earliest songs, "Smiles" and "I Could Do, Could Do, Could Do with a Bit", both written for him by Walter Tilbury.

In 1890 Little Tich continued to impress his London music hall audiences and appeared on the front covers of both the "Entr'acte" and the "Music Hall" magazine, with the latter being widely available in the majority of London music hall auditoriums. Towards the end of the year, Little Tich appeared at the opening of the <a href="Tivoli%20Music%20Hall%20%28London%29">Tivoli Music Hall</a>, before returning to Manchester at Christmas to fulfil the second of his two pantomime engagements for Thomas Charles in "<a href="Little%20Bo-peep">Little Bo-peep</a>", in which he played Toddlekins. The following year he reprised his role of Quasimodo and toured the provinces in "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" with Balmain's company.

The year 1891 signalled a new era in the career of Little Tich. The Drury Lane pantomimes were known for their extravagance and splendour and featured lavish sets and big budgets. The first of the Drury Lane pantomimes in which Little Tich appeared was "<a href="Humpty%20Dumpty">Humpty Dumpty</a>" in 1891 which also starred Drury Lane regulars <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a>, <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Campbell">Herbert Campbell</a>. As well as the title role, Little Tich also played the minor part of the Yellow Dwarf in the harlequinade. It was during the latter characterisation that he revived his Big-Boot Dance, which was a hit with audiences. The following Christmas, he equalled this success with his second pantomime "<a href="Little%20Bo-Peep">Little Bo-Peep</a>" in which he played the part of "Hop of my Thumb". As well as Leno, Lloyd and Campbell, Harris recruited the singers <a href="Ada%20Blanche">Ada Blanche</a> and <a href="Cecilia%20Loftus">Cecilia Loftus</a> as principal boy and girl respectively. Harris was thrilled with Little Tich and signed him for the 1893–94 pantomime "Robinson Crusoe" in which he played Man Friday. The "<a href="Derby%20Telegraph">Derby Daily Telegraph</a>" called the comedian "one of the most amusing pantomime dames of all time". Despite a budget of £30,000, "Robinson Crusoe" failed to equal the success of the previous two shows, which caused Harris to rethink his cast. Unaware of Harris's plans, Little Tich approached him with a view of a pay rise; the proposition angered the manager and not only was his request refused, but he was also ruled out of any future production.

In the early months of 1891, Little Tich completed a successful tour of Germany. Two years later he developed the character Miss Turpentine for his self-choreographed sketch "The Serpentine Dance", which he performed over the next three years in Hamburg, Geneva, Rotterdam, Brussels, Nice, Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Budapest; the tour also enabled him to become fluent in French, German, Italian and Spanish. He portrayed Miss Turpentine as an eccentric ballerina who wore an ill-fitting <a href="Ballet%20tutu">tutu</a>. The dance was a comic variation of the well-known skirt dance belonging to <a href="Loie%20Fuller">Loie Fuller</a>, which had been popular in France years earlier. Another successful characterisation was that of an eccentric Spanish dancer, which Little Tich devised while touring Europe, and like "The Serpentine Dance", relied heavily on acrobatic choreography and comic miming rather than eccentric singing and joke reciting.

It was around this period when Little Tich was inducted into the fledgling entertainers' fraternity, the <a href="Grand%20Order%20of%20Water%20Rats">Grand Order of Water Rats</a>. In 1906, he would serve as "King Rat" for the order. In 1894, free from his contractual obligations at Drury Lane, he took a three-year break from the English music hall scene and travelled to France to fulfil a number of engagements; over the next ten years, he divided his time between there and England. In the early months of 1895, he moved from music hall to <a href="Variety%20show">variety theatre</a>, a transition which many of his contemporaries had already successfully achieved. "Lord Tom Noddy" was showcased in September 1896 and ran at the <a href="Garrick%20Theatre">Garrick Theatre</a>, London for two months. The production had minimal success in the capital but was received well in the provinces. The show provided Little Tich with the chance to promote himself as a serious actor and to separate himself from the reputation of simply being the "deformed dwarf from the music hall". The audience were described as being "very large" whose "bursts of laughter w[ere] frequent and loud". A reporter for the "Edinburgh Evening News" thought that Little Tich was "the life and soul of the sketch" whose singing was "fairly good while [his] dancing was smart", while the critic <a href="William%20Archer%20%28critic%29">William Archer</a> dismissed Little Tich as being the "Quasimodo of the music halls, whose talent lies in a grotesque combination of agility with deformity".
He formed his own theatre company in mid-1895, and produced his first show called "Lord Tom Noddy", in which he also starred. He commissioned the dramatist <a href="George%20Dance%20%28dramatist%29">George Dance</a> to write the piece and made him a partner in the company. On 11 December 1896, Little Tich was invited to appear at the <a href="Folies%20Berg%C3%A8re">Folies Bergère</a> in France, where he starred in a short piece as Miss Turpentine and performed the Big-Boot Dance. One journalist for the "Sunday Referee" claimed that "no artist since Loie Fuller, four years earlier, had scored such a success", and as a result, he signed a two-year contract at the Folies. Little Tich returned to England in the later months of 1897, where he self-produced the second of his company's two shows, a musical comedy called "Billy". Despite the show enjoying a healthy provincial tour after opening in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>, one reporter thought that "it ha[d] not very much to recommend it", but thought that Little Tich gave "some excellent fooling" and that it "[was] impossible not to laugh at some of the eccentricities". However, the <a href="farce">farce</a> failed to make it to the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End of London</a>. Little Tich saw this as a snub and he refused to perform in the capital again. Instead, he travelled to <a href="South%20Shields">South Shields</a>, where he appeared briefly in a successful short play called "Giddy Ostend" before retreating to France.

In 1898 he broke the Folies contract shortly before its expiry after being scouted by <a href="Joseph%20Oller">Joseph Oller</a>, who hired him to perform at the <a href="Olympia%20%28Paris%29">Olympia Music Hall</a> in Paris. Following the breach of contract, the Folies manager Édouard Marchand initiated legal action against the comedian, who settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. The theatrical manager <a href="Charles%20B.%20Cochran">C.B. Cochran</a> who had seen the comedian perform during this period, described him as "a reincarnation of the dwarf court-jesters of the Middle Ages – the little English Don Antonio of Velasquez". By now, Little Tich had become frustrated with his English audiences. With "Billy" failing to reach London and the unequal level of success in the English capital compared to France made him shun the English variety theatre scene altogether in the final years of the century. He returned to the less-popular music halls as a result, where he remained for the rest of his career.

In September 1894, Little Tich and Laurie established the family home in the rue Lafayette, Paris. During 1897, while Little Tich was away on a tour of England, Germany and Austria, Laurie eloped to Berlin with the French actor François Marty, leaving her husband responsible for their young son Paul. Unable to care for Paul, Little Tich sent him to England to live with relatives. That year, Little Tich met the dancer Julia Recio during an engagement at the Olympia Music Hall in Paris and the two began a relationship. They moved to a flat in the boulevard Poissonnière, Paris, where they lived together, though keeping this a secret until after Laurie Relph's death in 1901. In 1900 Little Tich appeared in the French capital's Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre where he performed the Big-Boot Dance, which was recorded on film by the French director <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment-Maurice">Clément-Maurice</a>. Years later, the film-maker <a href="Jacques%20Tati">Jacques Tati</a> called the piece "a foundation for everything that has been realised in comedy on the screen".

In 1902 Little Tich starred in a special, one-off revue with Marie Lloyd at the Tivoli theatre called "The Revue", which was staged to celebrate the coronation of <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII">Edward VII</a>. The following year, Little Tich's performance at the Oxford Music Hall was described as being "... a very droll turn" by a reporter for "The Cornishman" newspaper, who also called his Big-Boot Dance "wonderful". Little Tich rented another London property at 1 Teignmouth Road in <a href="Kilburn%2C%20London">Kilburn</a>, to escape his life with Julia, which he was finding increasingly mundane. Despite their troubles, he married Julia in a discreet London ceremony on 31 March 1904 at <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20London">St Giles</a> Register Office and rented a further address at 44 Bedford Court Mansions in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>. Although initially happy, the marriage quickly deteriorated as a result of differing opinions over social activities and money; Julia was a sociable and extravagant person, whilst Little Tich preferred a quieter and thriftier lifestyle.
By 1906 Little Tich and Julia had become so estranged that she moved to a neighbouring flat, rented for her by her husband. The couple never publicly announced their separation, and he continued to provide financial support for his wife and fund her extravagant lifestyle for the next twenty years. Years later, Paul Relph admitted "Father and Julia never loved one another. Poor, poor father. His life was one long misery through her." Over the next four years, Little Tich continued to perform in both England and France and earned £10,000 a year. In 1905 he appeared in the second of a further three films for the French film industry called "Le Raid Paris – Monte-Carlo en Deux Heures", directed by <a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>. This was followed by "Little Tich" in 1907, and "Little Tich, the Tec" two years later.
In 1907 Little Tich travelled to South Africa, where he appeared in a successful, nine-week engagement for a fee of £500 a week. Soon after, he returned to England to take part in the <a href="Music%20Hall%20War%20of%201907">Music Hall War</a>, which saw the <a href="Variety%20Artistes%27%20Federation">Variety Artistes' Federation</a> fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music hall performers. In 1909 he received a serious leg injury while on stage at the Belfast Hippodrome during a performance of the Serpentine Dance. A doctor in the audience diagnosed a dislocated knee, which forced the comedian to take seven weeks recuperation. Little Tich's performance was described by a reporter for the "Evening Telegraph and Post" as being "up to date" and declared the Serpentine Dance was "next to the Big-Boot Dance in popularity".

In 1910 Little Tich became the adoptive father of Rodolphe Knoepper, an orphan born in 1899 to the brother of the Russian acrobat Harry Alaska. Alaska had previously worked for Little Tich as his dresser and after his death, Knoepper moved into the Relph residence in France and started his education there. After a few months of living with Little Tich, he was moved to London to stay with Julia. In later years Little Tich's daughter Mary admitted that her father treated Knoepper as more of a son than Paul, who became estranged from the family by the 1920s. While in Paris in 1910, Little Tich was made an officer of the <a href="Ordre%20des%20Palmes%20Acad%C3%A9miques">Ordre des Palmes Académiques</a> by the French Ministry of Public Instruction for his services to the stage.

Towards the end of 1910, he travelled to Scotland to complete a short engagement at the King's Theatre in Dundee. His performance was described by a theatre reviewer for the "<a href="Evening%20Telegraph%20%28Dundee%29">Evening Telegraph</a>" as being "downright genuine fun" and "very entertaining". The following year Little Tich recorded the first of a selection of his music hall songs on one-sided <a href="Gramophone%20record">shellac</a> discs used in the early <a href="Gramophone%20record%23%26quot%3BAcoustical%26quot%3B%20recording">acoustic recording</a> process. Songs included "The Gas Inspector", "King Ki-Ki", "The Toreador" and "The Zoo Keeper" and were followed two years later by "The Waiter", "The Weather", "The Don of the Don Juans" and "A Risky Thing to Do".
In 1915 Little Tich cut short his engagement at the <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a> Hippodrome to take up a better offer in Paris. As a result, the proprietors of the Hippodrome sued for breach of contract and he had to pay them £103 in compensation. That year he recorded "The Tallyman", "The Gamekeeper", "The Skylark" and "The Pirate" onto disc before heading to the northern English provinces to prepare for that year's Christmas pantomime at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool. It was there that he met Winifred Latimer (1892–1973), a singer and actress who had had some success on the London stage under <a href="Seymour%20Hicks">Seymour Hicks</a> a few years previously. Tich and Winifred were both starring in the Christmas pantomime "Sinbad the Sailor", in which Little Tich played the title role and Winifred supported him as the principal boy. The two grew close and against her parents wishes, they began a relationship, shortly before the pantomime closed in the early months of 1916. "Sinbad the Sailor" was a big success and Winifred was widely praised for her performance, which she attributed to the guidance she received from Little Tich.

In 1916 Winifred moved into a rented flat in <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden</a>, chosen by Little Tich for its close proximity to his house in <a href="Bedford%20Square">Bedford Square</a>; this enabled him to visit her with less chance of being recognised. In 1917 he recorded "Tally-Ho!" and "The Best Man", the final two songs from his repertoire, onto shellac discs. That year Winifred became pregnant, which ended her career on the stage, a situation which pleased Little Tich immeasurably. However, Winifred was ostracised by her family and had to contend with life as an unmarried mother with no career and no chances of ever realising her remaining theatrical ambitions. On 23 February 1918, while Little Tich was performing in Brighton, she gave birth to a daughter whom she named Mary. She and Mary then moved to 64 Gloucester Place in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>.

By 1920, relations between Little Tich and Winifred's parents had improved and they welcomed him into the family. Despite renting a new, six-room flat in Marylebone for his daughter and mistress, the comedian was now finding it increasingly difficult to support Winifred, Mary and Julia on his earnings as the years of generosity had drastically depleted his savings. His annual income in 1921 and 1922 had topped £9,750 but had dropped to £3,743 by 1923. In 1925 he earned £6,300 but this fell the following year to just £2,100. Worried by the drastic reduction in pay, he reduced Julia's payments, which angered her family. Another money-saving plan was to stop renting properties in London and secure a mortgage on a small house instead. To avoid speculation about his affair with Winifred, he decided to remain at Bedford Court Mansions, and bought a newly built house in Shirehall Park, <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>, North-West London in September 1925 for Winifred and Mary to move into. Soon after, he embarked on a successful tour of Europe which culminated at Christmas the same year. He returned to London and took part in a Christmas benefit at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a>, where he performed the Big-Boot Dance. The performance was by now proving too strenuous for the 58-year-old comedian, and he decided to retire it that year.

On the morning of 7 January 1926, Julia Relph died of a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral haemorrhage</a> in the flat which Little Tich had rented for her. Despite their estrangement, the comedian was distraught at her death and spent two nights at the apartment with her corpse. A few days later, he moved in with Winifred where he arranged his wife's funeral, staying in the spare bedroom as a "house guest". He made frequent visits back to Bedford Court Mansions to organise Julia's paperwork and discovered that his wife had been having an affair with his friend Emile Footgers and that she was ten years older than she had led her husband to believe. Little Tich also found that she had used his money to buy a house in Golders Green as a future investment for Paul's daughter Constance, and that his wife had participated in a secret scam to blackmail the comedian out of large quantities of cash. Despite the revelations, Little Tich mourned deeply for his wife and spoke fondly of her for the rest of his life.
On 10 April 1926, Little Tich married Winifred at <a href="Caxton%20Hall">Caxton Hall</a>, <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, with little publicity. Later that evening, he appeared at the Camberwell Palace in a short but popular engagement, while his new wife returned home to Hendon. For the honeymoon, the family travelled to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where Little Tich appeared on stage with the French actress <a href="Mistinguett">Mistinguett</a>, who presented him with a tributary gold statue of him wearing big boots. At the end of that year, the family paid a working visit to Australia, where he toured the Sydney theatres for a fee of £300 a week; he received a lukewarm reception from audiences.

The following March, Little Tich and his family returned to England. He made only one appearance on stage that year, in November, when he introduced a new song called "The Charlady at the House of Commons". For the character's appearance he wore a ripped and dirty frock, a scrag wig and carried an old mop and bucket which he borrowed from home. The act required him to flip the mop up into the air and grabbing the handle before carrying on singing. During one evening's performance at the Alhambra Theatre, the trick went wrong and he received a blow to his head from the mop. Despite the pain, he continued with the piece and refused to seek medical treatment for the resulting bump and intense headache which followed.

One December morning in 1927, whilst getting ready for a family day out, Little Tich was conversing with his wife who was in a separate room, upstairs at Shirehall Park. When he stopped responding, she became concerned, went to the room where her husband was, and found him slumped and insensible in a chair. He was taken to <a href="Guy%27s%20Hospital">hospital</a> where doctors diagnosed a stroke. He became <a href="Muteness">mute</a> and lost all feeling on the right side of his body, but was discharged from hospital and returned home to Hendon. He was frequently visited by the surgeon <a href="Alfred%20Downing%20Fripp%20%28surgeon%29">Sir Alfred Fripp</a>, who made a secondary diagnosis of <a href="Pernicious%20anemia">pernicious anaemia</a> which he cited as having played an instrumental part in the comedian's seizure.

On the morning of 10 February 1928, Little Tich died at his home in Shirehall Park, Hendon, aged 60 and he was later buried at <a href="East%20Finchley%20Cemetery">East Finchley Cemetery</a>. His death and funeral were national news. The author and theatre critic <a href="W.%20J.%20MacQueen-Pope">Walter MacQueen-Pope</a> predicted that Little Tich would be remembered for his "physical peculiarity and the expression 'tichy', meaning small". A reporter for "The Daily News" called him "[the] comedian whose popularity had never waned and whose name was as famous in 1928 as it was when music-halls flourished 30 years ago". Writing in 1974, the author Naomi Jacob thought that Little Tich would be remembered for many years to come stating that "there is no reason why such names as Little Tich and Marie Lloyd should be forgotten any more than such names as Salvini, Bernhardt and Henry Irving".

Apollo 15 postal covers incident

The Apollo 15 postal covers incident, a 1972 <a href="NASA">NASA</a> scandal, involved the astronauts of <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a>, who carried about 400 unauthorized <a href="event%20cover">postal covers</a> into space and to the <a href="Moon%27s%20surface">Moon's surface</a> on the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> "Falcon". Some of the envelopes were sold at high prices by West German <a href="stamp%20dealer">stamp dealer</a> Hermann Sieger, and are known as "Sieger covers". The crew of Apollo 15, <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Worden">Alfred Worden</a> and <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a>, agreed to take payments for carrying the covers; though they returned the money, they were reprimanded by NASA. Amid much press coverage of the incident, the astronauts were called before a closed session of a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> committee and never flew in space again.

The three astronauts and an acquaintance, Horst Eiermann, had agreed to have the covers made and taken into space. Each astronaut was to receive about $7,000. Scott arranged to have the covers postmarked on the morning of the Apollo 15 launch on July 26, 1971. They were packaged for space and brought to him as he prepared for liftoff. Due to an error, they were not included on the list of the personal items he was taking into space. The covers spent July 30 to August 2 on the Moon inside the "Falcon". On August 7, the date of <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a>, the covers were postmarked again on the recovery carrier . One hundred were sent to Eiermann (and passed on to Sieger); the remaining covers were divided among the astronauts.

Worden had agreed to carry 144 additional covers, largely for an acquaintance, <a href="F.%20Herrick%20Herrick">F. Herrick Herrick</a>; these had been approved for travel to space. Apollo 15 carried a total of approximately 641 covers. In late 1971, when NASA learned that the Herrick covers were being sold, the astronauts' supervisor, <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, warned Worden to avoid further commercialization of what he had been allowed to take into space. After Slayton heard of the Sieger arrangement, he removed the three as backup crew members for <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a>, though the astronauts had by then refused compensation from Sieger and Eiermann. The Sieger matter became generally known in the newspapers in June 1972. There was widespread coverage; some said astronauts should not be allowed to reap personal profits from NASA missions.

By 1977, all three former astronauts had left NASA. In 1983, Worden sued for the return of the covers impounded in 1972, and the three men received them in an out-of-court settlement. One of the covers given to Sieger sold for over $50,000 in 2014.
After the start of the <a href="Space%20Age">Space Age</a> with the launch of <a href="Sputnik%20I">Sputnik I</a> on October 4, 1957, <a href="astrophilately">astrophilately</a> (space-related <a href="stamp%20collecting">stamp collecting</a>) began. Nations such as the United States and <a href="Postage%20stamps%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">USSR</a> issued commemorative postage stamps depicting spacecraft and satellites. Astrophilately was most popular during the years of the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>'s Moon landings from 1969 to 1972. Collectors and dealers sought <a href="philatelic">philatelic</a> souvenirs related to the American space flight program, often through specially-designed envelopes (known as <a href="event%20cover">covers</a>). <a href="Cancellation%20%28mail%29">Cancelling</a> covers submitted by the public became a major duty of the employees of the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC) post office on space mission launch days.

The American <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s participated in creating collectables. Beginning in the late 1960s, Harold G. Collins, head of the Mission Support Office at KSC, arranged for specially designed envelopes to be printed for the different missions, and to be canceled on the launch dates. Such unflown philatelic covers were often gifts for the astronauts' friends, or for employees of <a href="NASA">NASA</a> and its contractors. Although it was not publicly known until September 1972, 15 of the men who entered space as Apollo program astronauts before Apollo 15 had agreed with a <a href="West%20German">West German</a> named Horst Eiermann to autograph 500 philatelic items (postcards and blocks of stamps) in exchange for $2,500. This included a member of each mission between <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> (1968) and <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> (1970). These items were not taken into space.

The astronauts were allowed to take Personal Preference Kits (PPKs) into space with them. These small bags, with their contents limited in size and weight, contained personal items the astronauts wanted to be flown as souvenirs of the mission. As the spaceflights moved toward and culminated in the Moon landings, the public's fascination with items flown in space increased, as did their value.

Covers were prepared by the crews and flown on <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>, Apollo 13 and <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>. <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Ed Mitchell</a>, lunar module pilot for Apollo 14, took his to the Moon's surface in a PPK. These were often retained by the astronauts for many years; Apollo 11's <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> kept his until he died, and they were not offered for sale until 2018, when one sold for $156,250.
The Apollo 15 mission began when the spacecraft blasted off from KSC on July 26, 1971, and ended when the astronauts and the <a href="Command%20Module">Command Module</a> "Endeavour" were recovered by the aircraft carrier on August 7. Onboard "Endeavour" were Mission Commander <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a>, Command Module Pilot <a href="Alfred%20Worden">Alfred Worden</a> and Lunar Module Pilot <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a>. The <a href="Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> "Falcon", with Scott and Irwin aboard, landed on the Moon on July 30, and remained there for just under 67 hours. The mission set several space records and was the first to use the <a href="lunar%20rover">lunar rover</a>. Scott and Irwin rode it to explore the area around the landing site during three periods of extravehicular activity (EVA). On August 2, before finishing the final EVA and entering the Lunar Module, Scott used a special postmarking device to cancel a <a href="first%20day%20cover">first day cover</a> provided by the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> bearing two new stamps, whose designs depicted lunar astronauts and a rover, commemorating the tenth anniversary of Americans entering space. That cover was returned to the Postal Service after the mission, and is now in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Postal%20Museum">National Postal Museum</a>.

Eiermann knew a stamp dealer named Hermann Sieger from <a href="Lorch%20%28W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Lorch</a>, West Germany. The two had met by chance while on a bus to observe the launch of <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> in late 1969; Eiermann heard by Sieger's <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian</a> inflection that they were from the same part of Germany, and invited him to his house. Sieger got the idea for the lunar covers after hearing that the Apollo 12 astronauts had taken a Bible with them. When Sieger learned that Eiermann knew many astronauts, he proposed that an Apollo crew be persuaded to take covers to the Moon. Eiermann did not think astronauts would take money to do so, but agreed to ask them when Sieger characterized the payments as investments for the astronauts' children. Eiermann did not mention Sieger's name in his approach to the astronauts.

Eiermann lived in <a href="Cocoa%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Cocoa Beach, Florida</a> at the time of Apollo 15, and was a local representative of Los Angeles-based Dyna-Therm Corporation, which was a NASA contractor. According to Scott's autobiography, one night several months before launch, the astronauts' supervisor, Director of Flight Crew Operations <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, had Scott and the other crew members come to dinner at Eiermann's house; Scott described Eiermann as a longtime friend of Slayton. Worden, in his autobiography, agreed that the crew was invited to dinner there, but described Scott as inviting his crewmates, and did not mention involvement by Slayton. In his testimony before a congressional committee in 1972, Scott described Eiermann as a "friend of ours", someone with whom he had dined and who knew many people at KSC, including a number of the astronauts. Scott also told the committee that he had met Eiermann at a party, rather than through another astronaut.

At the dinner, Eiermann proposed the astronauts carry 100 special stamp covers, to be flown to the Moon. Worden stated that he and Irwin, who had not previously gone into space, were assured that this was common practice. Worden recalled that the astronauts were told the covers would not be sold until some time in the future after the Apollo program had ended. They would receive $7,000 each. They were informed that other Apollo crews had made and profited from similar agreements. Earlier astronauts had been given free <a href="life%20insurance">life insurance</a> by <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a>. This benefit was no longer available by the time of Apollo 15. Worden wrote that to ensure their families were provided for given the severe risks and dangers of their profession, the astronauts agreed to the deal, planning to put the payments aside as funds for their children. At the time, Scott earned $2,199 a month as an astronaut, Worden $1,715 and Irwin $2,235.

According to Scott, the astronauts also decided the covers would make good gifts and requested an additional 100 each for a total of 400 covers. Scott indicated in his testimony that after discussion with his crewmates, he expected the covers to be a "very private and noncommercial enterprise." He added: "I admit that this is wrong. I understand it very clearly now. But at the time, for some naive and thoughtless reason, I did not understand the significance of it." Irwin wrote in his autobiography that the initial meeting with Eiermann took place in May 1971, and that the astronauts met with him twice thereafter. Eiermann relayed instructions from Sieger on how to prepare the covers: they were to be postmarked twice, at KSC on the date of launch and on the recovery ship on the date of splashdown, and carry a signed statement from the astronauts with a certification from a <a href="notary%20public">notary</a>. The certification would make the covers more sellable in Europe, where <a href="Civil%20law%20notary">a notary</a> is a legal professional who often verifies the document, not just the signatures.

An additional 144 covers were flown pursuant to an understanding between Worden and <a href="F.%20Herrick%20Herrick">F. Herrick Herrick</a> of Miami, a retired movie director and a stamp collector. According to a letter reporting on the stamp incident from NASA Administrator <a href="James%20C.%20Fletcher">James C. Fletcher</a> to the chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Aeronautical%20and%20Space%20Sciences">Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences</a>, <a href="Clinton%20P.%20Anderson">Clinton P. Anderson</a>, Herrick was a friend of the three astronauts who had arranged for Worden, also a stamp collector, to buy an album full of stamps and proposed the astronauts take covers into space. These would be split and set aside for some years, and then sold. In his book Worden said he had been introduced to Herrick at lunch by former race car driver <a href="Jim%20Rathmann">Jim Rathmann</a>, and that Herrick proposed the plan. Worden also related his insistence the covers must be held, unsold and unpublicized, until after the Apollo program had ended, and he had retired from NASA and the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>. "I didn't want to do anything that would embarrass either myself or NASA, and I believed Herrick was as good as his word. It was a huge lapse in judgment on my part to trust this stranger. I was too old to believe in Santa Claus." In his 1972 testimony before the Senate committee, Worden described Herrick as a friend with whom he had had past dealings, and with whom he discussed the possibility of commemorative covers. According to a 1978 <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Justice Department</a> report, before the Apollo 15 flight Herrick advised Worden that taking covers to the Moon would be a prudent investment because they would be valuable to stamp collectors.

While Scott and his crewmates were completing their mission training, a controversy developed within NASA and <a href="92nd%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> over some of the souvenir silver medallions the crew of Apollo 14 had carried to the Moon. The private <a href="Franklin%20Mint">Franklin Mint</a>, which had supplied the medallions in question, melted down some of those that had been flown. These were mixed with a large quantity of other metal, and commemorative medallions were struck from the mass, used as a premium to attract people to pay to join the Franklin Mint Collector's Club. The fact that some part of the medals had flown to the Moon was used in the mint's advertisements. Because the Apollo 14 crew had accepted no money, they were not disciplined. Slayton reduced the number of medallions each member of Apollo 15 could take along by half. He warned the Apollo 15 crew against carrying any items into space that could make money for them or others. In August 1965, Slayton had issued regulations requiring that items astronauts planned to carry be listed, approved by him, and checked for safety in space if similar items had not already been flown. Each crew member was bound by NASA standards of conduct issued in 1967 forbidding using one's position to make money for oneself or another person.

Eiermann was supposed to create the <a href="cachet">cachet</a> for the special covers he had proposed, but time ran short and Scott did it instead. He used the Apollo 15 <a href="mission%20patch">mission patch</a> to create the design, and gave it to Collins of the Mission Support Office. Collins arranged with the Brevard Printing Company of Cocoa, Florida for the design to be reproduced on both regular and lightweight envelopes. The company performed the work and billed Alvin B. Bishop Jr. $156 for the lightweight envelopes and $209 for the regular ones. Bishop, a public relations executive who specialized in the aerospace industry, and knew many astronauts, created specially designed covers for a number of the Apollo missions, which he supplied only to the crew and their families. He was at the time employed by <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Hughes Enterprises</a> in Las Vegas; the company paid the bill.

Herrick secured the services of a commercial artist, Vance Johnson, with whom Worden discussed the design, resulting in 100 envelopes depicting the phases of the Moon. Worden listed these covers as part of the contents of his PPK for Slayton's approval, along with 44 first day covers that he owned. Ad-Pro Graphics, Inc. of Miami printed the Herrick envelopes, along with card inserts stating the accompanying cover had been carried on Apollo 15. Herrick paid the firm's bill of $50.50; he also obtained the postage stamps for the covers, and two rubber stamps stating the dates of the launch and splashdown. The design was printed on labels that were affixed to the envelopes. Not all Herrick covers are identical, as different cachets, rubber stamp impressions and combinations of postage stamps were used. Worden also carried a cover postmarked in 1928, autographed by aviation pioneer <a href="Orville%20Wright">Orville Wright</a>.

In addition to those brought by Scott and by Worden, Irwin carried 96 covers, one with a "flown-to-the-Moon" theme, eight with an Apollo 15 design, and 87 covers honoring <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>, carried as a favor for Barbara Gordon, wife of Apollo 12 astronaut <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Dick Gordon</a>. Barbara Gordon, a stamp collector, had wanted her husband to take the covers on his lunar mission, but he had refused. The flown-to-the-moon cover was a favor for a friend of Dick Gordon. Apollo 15 carried the cover from the Postal Service to be canceled on the surface of the Moon. The agency also sent a backup, stowed in the Command Module with another cancellation device, for use on the homeward journey if Scott did not get to postmark the lunar cover.
All covers except the group of 400 had been approved by Slayton, who stated in his testimony that he would almost certainly have approved them if asked (assuming their weight could be negotiated with the Flight Manager), on condition that they stay in the Command Module and not go to the lunar surface. In July 1972, after the story broke, <a href="William%20Hines">William Hines</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" wrote that "the idea that this complicated caper could have been carried out without the knowledge and at least tacit permission of Slayton is regarded by people familiar with NASA as ludicrous. Slayton's tight rein over his sometimes fractious charges is legendary."

The crew bought several hundred of the ten-cent First Man on the Moon postage stamp issue. These were affixed to the lightweight envelopes by secretaries in the <a href="Astronaut%20Office">Astronaut Office</a>. Collins had made arrangements for the KSC post office to open at 1:00 am <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a> on launch day—opening this facility so early on an Apollo launch morning was not unusual—and brought several hundred of the stamped covers. Once the envelopes had been run through the cancellation machine, he took them to the astronaut quarters, where members of the Flight Crew Support Team vacuum sealed them in teflon-covered fiberglass to fireproof them for space. Normally, if the Flight Crew Support Team found that an item was not on an astronaut's PPK list, they would add it, and make sure they were approved, but team leader James L. Smotherman stated that he "goofed", explaining that he had confused the 400 covers with the Herrick envelopes, which had been approved by Slayton. Since the 400 covers had not been approved by Slayton, they were considered unauthorized. Scott stated, "I never intended to bootleg the covers. If I had intended to bootleg the covers, I certainly would not have allowed Mr. Collins to handle them or the rest of the people to assist me." Like other items being placed in the pockets on Scott's <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a> (for example, his sunglasses), they were first shown to him by the suit technicians helping him dress. Divided into two packets, the bundled covers were about thick and weighed about ; they entered the spacecraft in Scott's pocket. Apollo 15 blasted off for the Moon at 9:34 am on July 26, 1971, with three astronauts and about 641 covers aboard.
At some point while the mission was en route to the Moon, the 400 covers were moved into the lunar lander "Falcon"; in his testimony, Scott agreed this violated the rules. He stated he did not recall how the transfer took place, and that he was only certain that the envelopes went to the lunar surface because they were in the bag of items taken out of the "Falcon" in preparation for the return to Earth. Worden stated in his testimony that they were aware of the presence of the covers in the Command Module after the mission's launch, but he did not recall if the covers had been among the many items moved into the "Falcon" in preparation for the lunar landing; he did not believe the matter had been discussed during the flight. He wrote in his autobiography that the night he had agreed to the deal with Eiermann "was the last I heard or thought of about the covers until after the flight ... What arrangements Dave [Scott], Eiermann, and Sieger made to get the covers onto the flight, I never knew until later. Dave later told a congressional committee that he had placed them in a pocket of his spacesuit, but he never shared that information with me". He indicated that the covers he had arranged to have on board, including those from Herrick, remained in his PPK in the Command Module throughout the flight. The testimony before Congress, from multiple individuals including Apollo 15 astronauts, was that carrying the covers did not interfere with the mission in any way.
Apollo 15 splashed down about north of Honolulu at 4:46 pm <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a> () on August 7, 1971; the crew was retrieved by helicopters from the "Okinawa". Scott had asked that a supply of the twin space stamps of the design he had canceled on the Moon (issued August 2) be available on the "Okinawa", and on July 14, Forrest J. Rhodes, who ran the postal facility at KSC, wrote to the <a href="Chief%20Petty%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29">Chief Petty Officer</a> in charge of the "Okinawa"s post office. The ship replied on the 20th, saying the stamps could be obtained in time. The stamps were secured from the post office at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor%20Naval%20Base">Pearl Harbor</a>; 4,000 were flown to the "Okinawa" at sea by helicopter, reportedly in the custody of a naval officer joining the vessel. The astronauts had no money with them; their purchases were paid for by high-ranking officers aboard the "Okinawa", who were later reimbursed. The crew had the assistance of "Okinawa" crew members in affixing the stamps to the 400 covers for cancellation by the ship's post office. The Irwin covers were not postmarked, either at liftoff or splashdown. Worden wrote in his book that he never saw the covers Scott had brought until the astronauts were on the flight to Houston. However, as Scott mentioned he was having them postmarked with the splashdown date, Worden arranged to have that done for the ones he had taken into space. On the flight, the 400 covers were autographed by the three astronauts; the Herrick covers were also signed while en route. Irwin remembered the signing took several hours.

On August 31, 1971, C.G. Carsey, a clerk in the Astronaut Office in Houston, typed certifications on 100 of the covers, with the aid of other NASA employees in her office. The certifications stated the cover had been on the Moon aboard the "Falcon". The covers already carried a handwritten statement signed by Scott and Irwin that they had been landed on the Moon on July 30. Carsey later stated that in signing the certifications as a Texas <a href="notary%20public">notary public</a>, she only intended to certify their signatures were genuine. The question of whether Carsey had improperly certified that the covers had been landed on the Moon (something she had no personal knowledge of) was the subject of an investigation by the <a href="Texas%20Attorney%20General">Texas Attorney General</a>. With the notary certifications, the last of Sieger's requirements for the covers was fulfilled. On September 2, Scott sent the 100 covers by <a href="registered%20mail">registered mail</a> to Eiermann, who was in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> where he had moved. Eiermann turned the covers over to Sieger, and was rewarded with a commission of about $15,000—ten percent of the anticipated proceeds. The remaining 300 were entrusted by the astronauts to a Houston-area stamp collector who arranged with a local printer to have an inscription stating that the cover had been carried to the Moon printed in the upper left. The printer discovered there were 298 covers, not 300; the stamp collector consulted Scott, who told him not to worry about it. One of Irwin's covers from the group of eight, with a shamrock design as its cachet, was given to Rhodes and one to the president of the Kennedy Space Center Philatelic Society; Irwin said in 1972 that he had retained the other six.

Sieger notified his customers of the flown covers via a mailing, selling them at <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a> 4,850 (about $1,500 at the time), with a discount to those who bought more than one. He kept one for himself, and by November had sold the remaining 99. He numbered and signed the backs of the envelopes in the lower left as a token of their genuineness.

Worden recalled in his book that he sent the agreed number of 44 covers to Herrick soon after returning from space. He also sent him 60 belonging to himself for safekeeping, and gave 28 to friends. Herrick consigned 70 covers to <a href="Robert%20A.%20Siegel">Robert A. Siegel</a>, a prominent New York dealer. Siegel sold ten covers for a total of $7,900, receiving a commission from Herrick of 25 percent. Herrick sold three himself for $1,250 each and placed several on commission in Europe.
In late October 1971, a potential customer for one of the Herrick covers wrote to NASA to inquire about its authenticity. On November 5, Slayton responded, saying NASA could not confirm whether it was genuine. He warned Worden to ensure that his covers would not be further commercialized. Worden wrote an angry letter to Herrick. In June 1972, Herrick instructed Siegel to send 60 covers to Worden in Houston, which he did by registered mail. Until this point, Siegel had assumed the 60 covers belonged to Herrick.

Probably before they made an official NASA trip to Europe in November 1971, the Apollo 15 astronauts received and completed the paperwork necessary to open accounts in a Stuttgart-area bank to receive the agreed $7,000 payments. According to Scott's testimony, while they were in Europe, they heard the Sieger covers were being sold commercially. Scott called Eiermann, who promised to look into it. The astronauts indicated they received the <a href="bankbook">bankbook</a>s in early 1972. Irwin remembered in his autobiography that before their trip to Europe, Scott came to him and said, "Jim, we are in trouble now—they are starting to sell the envelopes over there", and that the covers cast a shadow over their European trip. Scott said the crew discussed it among themselves, then decided that the receipt of funds was improper. In late February they returned the bankbooks to Eiermann, who responded that the astronauts should receive something for their efforts. Howard C. Weinberger, in his account of the Apollo 15 covers, deemed the astronauts' refusal "an effort to save their careers and reputations". The crew initially agreed to accept albums filled with aerospace-themed stamps for their children, including issues in honor of Apollo 15. Scott related that they decided this too was improper and said they wanted nothing. This final refusal happened in April 1972. Worden remembered, "we did this before NASA asked us anything about a deal with Sieger—before NASA even knew about it".
Discussion of the covers in European philatelic publications alerted collectors in the United States. On March 11, 1972, Lester Winick, president of a group of collectors of space stamps and covers known as the Space Topics Study Group, sent a letter to NASA's <a href="general%20counsel">general counsel</a> asking a number of questions about the Sieger covers. The letter was forwarded for a response to Slayton, who casually mentioned it to Irwin in late March; Irwin told him to talk to Scott. Slayton spoke with Worden on the assumption that the covers referred to were among the group of 144, but Worden told him this was not necessarily the case and that he should talk to Scott. Slayton did talk to Scott in mid-April, just before the launch of <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a>. Scott told him there had been 400 covers not on the approved list, and that 100 had been given to a friend. In his autobiography, Slayton wrote that he confronted Scott and Worden about what he called a "regular goddamn scandal": "they told me what the deal was, and I got pretty goddamn angry. So I was through with Scott, Worden, and Irwin. After 16 splashed down, I kicked them off the backup crew for 17." One reason for Slayton's anger was that he had defended the astronauts as rumors of the high prices being paid for the covers circulated; according to <a href="Andrew%20Chaikin">Andrew Chaikin</a> in his history of the Apollo program, Slayton "went out on a limb to defend his people". Slayton wrote to Winick, stating that the spacecraft had carried covers, but NASA could not confirm these particular envelopes had been taken; he did not tell Winick unauthorized covers had been flown. He sent a copy of his response to the general counsel's office at NASA Headquarters in Washington, which took no action. Slayton did not inform Administrator Fletcher, Deputy Administrator <a href="George%20M.%20Low">George M. Low</a> or his own superior, <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft">Christopher C. Kraft</a> of the postage stamp incident or of the disciplinary action he had taken.

In early June 1972, Low heard from a member of his staff of the possibility covers flown on Apollo 15 might have been sold in Europe. He asked Associate Administrator <a href="Dale%20D.%20Myers">Dale D. Myers</a> to enquire through NASA management channels for information. Low kept Fletcher informed of the situation as it developed. Myers made an interim report to Low on the 16th. Before he could make his final report on the 26th, the story broke with an article in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Star">The Washington Sunday Star</a>" on June 18. Kraft interviewed Scott on the 23rd. Low ordered a full investigation by NASA's Inspections Division on June 29. On July 10, the three astronauts were <a href="reprimand">reprimand</a>ed for poor judgment, something that made it extremely unlikely that they would be selected to fly in space again. Richard S. Lewis, in his early history of the Apollo program, noted that "in the atmosphere of wheeling and dealing that has characterized government agency-industrial contractor relations in the Space Age, the unauthorized freight that the Apollo 15 crew hauled to the moon was a boyish prank. In the rhetoric of space program critics, though, it was branded as exploitation for personal gain of the most costly technological development in history. In the press, the astronauts were treated like fallen angels." Kraft remembered in his memoirs that Slayton told him, "They did it. There was no hiding. Dave just said sure, nothing wrong with it, right?" Scott, while stating, "we made a mistake in even considering it", felt that the reaction "was turning into a witch-hunt". Worden, though admitting blame for entering into the deal, felt that NASA had not adequately supported him, and that Scott had not taken full responsibility for his role. Irwin, who would become an evangelist after leaving the Astronaut Corps, said that NASA had no choice but to reprimand them. He hoped he could turn the experience to use in his ministry, that it would help him empathize with others who had erred.

Another story that broke in mid-July was the dispute over the sculpture "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>", left on the Moon by Scott in tribute to those killed in the American and <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet</a> space programs; the sculptor was having copies made for public sale, over the astronauts' objection. Having read of these things in the newspapers, and concerned about the appearance of commercialization of Apollo 15, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Aeronautical%20and%20Space%20Sciences">Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences</a> set a hearing for August 3. It called a number of NASA employees including the astronauts, Slayton, Kraft, Fletcher and Low to appear. Worden remembered that while there were difficult questions asked about the astronauts' conduct, part of the committee's concern was why NASA management had allowed another incident to happen so quickly after the Apollo 14 Franklin Mint matter. Members also wanted to know how it was that NASA's chain of command permitted allegations against the astronauts to go unreported to senior management. Invoking a rarely used Senate rule for when testimony might impact the reputation of witnesses or others, the committee chairman, Senator Anderson had the meeting closed to the public. Kraft remembered that while he and Low were grilled by the committee, the senators treated the astronauts "like gods".

None of the Apollo 15 crew ever flew in space again. Scott was made a technical adviser on the <a href="Apollo-Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a> (the first joint mission with the Soviet Union) and retired from the Air Force in 1975. He then became director of NASA's <a href="Dryden%20Flight%20Research%20Center">Dryden Flight Research Center</a>, retiring from NASA in October 1977 and entering the private sector. Worden transferred to NASA's <a href="Ames%20Research%20Center">Ames Research Center</a> in California, remaining there until his 1975 retirement both from the Air Force and NASA, and then entered the private sector. Irwin retired in 1972 and founded an evangelical group.

Fletcher asked astronauts still with NASA, and even those who were not, such as <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a>'s <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, to turn in all flown covers in their possession to NASA pending a determination of whether they were government property. Kraft related that there was resistance from astronauts, but "we confiscated them, sometimes under duress". These covers were returned when the Justice Department chose to take no action, "and whatever happened to them was kept quiet". Among the astronauts interviewed in NASA's investigation was Apollo 13's <a href="Jack%20Swigert">Jack Swigert</a>, who denied any dealings with envelopes; after he subsequently admitted he had, Low removed him from Apollo-Soyuz.

Kraft suspended some fifteen astronauts who "had broken faith with us and ignored a standing order from Deke"; some, having apologized and served their suspensions, flew on <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> in the mid-1970s. The covers affair resulted in prejudice in the Air Force against former astronauts (all three Apollo 15 astronauts had served there). This deterred Apollo 14's <a href="Stu%20Roosa">Stu Roosa</a> from returning to the Air Force when he left NASA, leading him to go into business instead. Although Apollo 16's <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a> had taken covers to the lunar surface in April 1972, changes to the PPK procedures instituted by NASA meant that none were taken on Apollo 17 that December. Today, astronauts are forbidden by <a href="Code%20of%20Federal%20Regulations">federal regulation</a> from taking philatelic items into space as mementoes.

The remaining covers in the Apollo 15 astronauts' control (298 from the group of 400 and 61 more from Worden) were held by NASA amid the investigation; Worden said he surrendered them at Kraft's request on the understanding they would be returned once the investigation was over, but the covers were transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Archives">National Archives</a> in August 1973. There was a Justice Department investigation into the covers. Its Criminal Division decided in 1974 that no prosecution was warranted, but the Civil Division the following year assumed the covers would be retained by the government. Kraft wrote, "it was questionable that any law had been broken and [the Justice Department] realized that dragging astronauts into court would not be a popular pastime." In 1978, the department issued a report indicating that while the government might have some claim to the Herrick covers due to the appearance of having been made for profit, it probably did not to the 298, which the astronauts had said were intended as gifts. In 1979, the department informed NASA that it had concluded that the government would likely lose if the astronauts sued for the covers. There was opposition among senators to the covers being returned, and in February 1980 a resolution passed the Senate that the government should keep the covers because of the commercialization. It died in the House of Representatives. In 1983, Worden sued, and the government agreed to return all the covers to the three astronauts. The government felt it could not successfully defend the lawsuit, and that NASA either authorized the covers to be flown or was aware of them.
Some of the covers were sold by the astronauts. One of the group of 298 impounded by the government and owned by Scott sold at the January 2008 Novaspace auction for $15,000. A Sieger cover sold in 2014 for over $55,000, the highest auction price to that point—the auctioneer noted that it was one of only four Sieger covers to come to public sale since the initial distribution. Worden sold many of the returned Herrick covers to pay debts from his unsuccessful 1982 run for Congress. When asked in 2011 where the covers were, he said, "Lord only knows. Some of them sold, some of them are still in a safety deposit box. They're probably all over the world by now." In a 2013 interview with Worden, <a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">"Slate"</a> magazine found that "he’s vexed by lingering inaccuracies in the Wikipedia entry about the incidents. We ask: Why didn’t he get a friend to log in and correct the entries? He responds with a startled pause. 'Is that right? I didn't know you could do that!' "

Déjà Vu (Beyoncé song)

"Déjà Vu" is a song by American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, featuring vocals by rapper <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>. It was produced by <a href="Rodney%20Jerkins">Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins</a> and Beyoncé for her second solo album, "<a href="B%27Day%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20album%29">B'Day</a>" (2006). "Déjà Vu" is an R&B song, which incorporates elements of the 1970s <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. Its music is largely based on live instrumentation, including <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, <a href="Hi-hat%20%28instrument%29">hi-hat</a>, <a href="French%20horn">horns</a>, except <a href="Roland%20TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> <a href="drum">drum</a> machine, which is a non-live instrument. The song's title and lyrics refer to a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover.

"Déjà Vu" was released as the album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> to US radio stations on June 24, 2006. The song received generally mixed critical reviews. Many critics noted the similarities of "Déjà Vu" with Beyoncé's own 2003 song "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love">Crazy in Love</a>". Critics commended the assertiveness and the sensuality with which Beyoncé sings the lyrics and compared her vocal delivery to that of <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a> in the late 1980s. "Déjà Vu" and its <a href="Freemasons%20%28band%29">Freemasons</a> club remix version received three nominations at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">2007 Grammy Awards</a>. It was recognized as the Best Song of 2006 at the <a href="Music%20of%20Black%20Origin%20Awards">Music of Black Origin (MOBO) Awards</a>.

Commercially, "Déjà Vu" peaked at number four on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart. It topped the <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Hot Dance Club Play</a> chart, the <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Singles%20Sales">Hot Dance Singles Sales</a> chart, and the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart. The song was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). "Déjà Vu" peaked at number one on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and generally reached the top 20 in Europe. The song's accompanying music video was directed by <a href="Sophie%20Muller">Sophie Muller</a>. About 5,000 fans <a href="online%20petition">petitioned online</a> for a re-shoot of the video, complaining about, amongst other factors, the lack of theme, the wardrobe choice, and the seemingly sexual interactions between Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

In 2005, American record producer Rodney "DarkChild" Jerkins and producer Jon Jon Traxx "came up with the concept of doing an old-school track, a throwback with real bass and horns", to which the song's title is partly attributed. Traxx with Jerkins, first recorded the <a href="Bass%20%28instrument%29">bass</a> sections, onto which the <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussion</a>, <a href="French%20horn">horns</a> and vocals were layered. Production took place in Jerkins' <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>-based studio, and <a href="Sony%20Music%20Studios">Sony Music Studios</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

Jerkins recorded a <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> version of the song with vocals by American songwriter <a href="Makeba%20Riddick">Makeba Riddick</a>, who is credited as co-writer. They presented the demo to Beyoncé, who later approved of it. "Déjà Vu" also has lyrical contributions from songwriters Delisha Thomas and Keli Nicole Price, and Beyoncé's husband (then-boyfriend) <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>. He became involved at a late stage, when Beyoncé saw him trying to sing along to a recorded version of the track, and asked him to contribute. Jay-Z recorded <a href="Rapping">rap</a> <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">verses</a> for the song and hence appears as a featured guest.

Concerning the production of "Déjà Vu", Beyoncé told <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>":
When I recorded 'Deja Vu' ... I knew that even before I started working on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to all of my songs. It's such a balance [of music on the song] [...] It's still young, still new and fresh, but it has the old soul groove. The energy is incredible. It's the summer anthem, I pray. I feel it. Rodney Jerkins is incredible, Jay of course is on it, he blessed the song, I'm happy with it.
"Déjà Vu" is a <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">contemporary R&B</a> song, performed in a moderate <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>. It is also influenced by late-1970s <a href="funk">funk</a> music, and it contains elements of <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> as well as <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by <a href="EMI">EMI Music Publishing</a>, the song is composed in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> with a <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> in <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a>, and a moderate groove of 106 <a href="Tempo">beats per minute</a>. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of <a href="D%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">D</a> to <a href="F%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a>. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, <a href="conga">conga</a>, <a href="Hi-hat%20%28instrument%29">hi-hat</a>, and horns. A non-live instrument, the <a href="Roland%20TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> <a href="drum">drum</a> machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic <a href="disco">disco</a> <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">beat</a>. Spence D. of <a href="IGN">IGN Music</a> commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are "silky smooth" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> noted that "Déjà Vu" is reminiscent of <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="Off%20the%20Wall%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20song%29">Off the Wall</a>" (1980).

The title refers to the "<a href="d%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20vu">déjà vu</a>" phenomenon. The lyrics to "Déjà Vu" follow the <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Verse">verse</a>–<a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Pre-chorus">pre-chorus</a>–<a href="song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Chorus">chorus</a> pattern, and feature two <a href="Rapping">rap verses</a>. It is <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>-laden, similar in this respect to "Crazy in Love". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, "Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, <a href="slide%20%28guitar%20technique%29">slides</a> into the main two-bar <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a>. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.

After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a>-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone "to play something more singing", in the words of Jon Jon Webb, the bass player on the track. The <a href="melody">melody</a> returns to the main groove during the repeated hook. This pattern repeats and leads to the second rap verse. The third pre-chorus "comes from Jerkins' idea to have the part changes on top, with Webb's main groove on the bottom". It is followed by the main pre-chorus, then the hook is repeated four times. After that, the singing stops and the instruments fill in the space of the pre-chorus. The hi-hat and Roland TR-808 also stop; the song ends with the plucked bass and blasts of horns from the very first line of the chorus.

"Déjà Vu" was leaked to the internet on June 13, 2006. On June 24, 2006, it was released to radio stations in the United States, four weeks after Beyoncé informed <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a>, her <a href="record%20label">record label</a>, that "B'Day" was completed. Over one month later, it was released to physical formats; the track was released as a <a href="Compact%20Disc%20single">CD single</a> on July 31, 2006 in the United States. An <a href="enhanced%20CD">enhanced CD</a> was released on September 12, containing five tracks and an additional "Déjà Vu" multimedia track. In the United Kingdom, the <a href="music%20download">digital download</a> became available on August 15, 2006. A CD maxi and a <a href="12-inch%20single">12" single</a> were released on August 21, 2006. Beyoncé's manager approached English production team <a href="Freemasons%20%28band%29">Freemasons</a> to <a href="remix">remix</a> "Déjà Vu" after hearing a remix they made for a song by singer <a href="Heather%20Headley">Heather Headley</a>. A club-oriented version was produced and appeared on a "<a href="Green%20Light%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles%20song%29">Green Light</a>" Freemasons <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>, released on July 31, 2007. A <a href="maxi%20single">maxi single</a>, featuring the album version of the track and Freemasons club mix, was released on August 5, 2006 in European countries. During an interview, Beyoncé further spoke about her decision to release the song as the first single from the album, saying, "it was soulful and had a lot of horns, it just felt good, and it didn'’t sound like everything on the radio. It wasn'’t typical but it felt timeless.". The UK hits compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 65, released in 2006, features an alternative version of the single, omitting Jay-Z's parts and running to 3 minutes and 25 seconds.

"Déjà Vu" debuted to mixed and positive reviews among critics. Mike Joseph of the international <a href="Online%20magazine">webzine</a> <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a><nowiki>'</nowiki> believed that it was "fantastic to hear Beyoncé singing her lungs out over a full-bodied groove featuring live instruments". Spence D. of <a href="IGN">IGN Music</a>, a multimedia news and reviews website, complimented Jerkins' bass-laden groove, writing that it brought the track to perfection. Describing "Déjà Vu" as a magnificent song, Caroline Sullivan of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" complimented Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaboration calling it "feverish as pre-watershed pop gets". She added that even though when Jay-Z is not physically present, he manages to bring out something formidable in Beyoncé that evokes "the young, feral <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>". <a href="Bernard%20Zuel">Bernard Zuel</a> "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" praised the assertiveness with which Beyoncé delivers her lines and considered buying "Déjà Vu" as worthwhile.

Several other music critics have compared "Déjà Vu" to Beyoncé's 2003 single, "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love">Crazy in Love</a>", the lead single of her <a href="dangerously%20in%20Love">debut album</a>. According to Gail Mitchell of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine, the song is viewed by many as a sequel to "Crazy in Love". Jason King of the "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine deemed the song as "cloned from the DNA of the raucous 'Crazy in Love'" while Thomas Inskeep of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>" Magazine referred to it as "'Crazy in Love' lite". Some reviewers, however, were negative to the parallels drawn between the two songs. Andy Kellman of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, an online music database, wrote that "['Déjà Vu'] "had the audacity to not be as monstrous as 'Crazy in Love'", referring to the commercial success the latter experienced in 2003. The internet-based publication <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">"Pitchfork"</a>'s writer Ryan Dombal claimed that "this time [Beyoncé] out-bolds the beat".

Sasha Frere-Jones of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" deemed the lyrics as a "perplexing view of memory", while Chris Richards of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" characterized Beyoncé as a "love-dazed girlfriend" in the song. <a href="Jody%20Rosen">Jody Rosen</a> of the "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" referred to "Déjà Vu" as an "oddly flat" choice as a lead single. Jaime Gill of <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a> regarded "Déjà Vu" as a good choice for a single but concluded that it does lack "the kind of killer chorus" to suggest that Beyoncé would take one further step "to outright global domination". On the other hand, Jon Pareles of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that Jay-Z shows up "as calmly boastful as ever" in the song but he only makes Beyoncé's "sound more insecure". <a href="Kelefa%20Sanneh">Kelefa Sanneh</a> of the same publication noted that "the refrain doesn't give Beyoncé a chance really to show off" and further described the song as a "fair-to-middling single from a singer who is the opposite of desperate".

"Déjà Vu" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap/Sung%20Collaboration">Best Rap/Sung Collaboration</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song">Best R&B Song</a> while the <a href="Freemasons%20%28band%29">Freemasons</a> club remix version was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Remixed%20Recording%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical</a> at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">2007 Grammy Awards</a>. It was also nominated for Best Collaboration alongside Beyoncé's other song "<a href="Upgrade%20U">Upgrade U</a>" featuring Jay-Z, at the <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">Black Entertainment Television</a> (BET) Awards. "Déjà Vu" won Best Song at the 2006 <a href="Music%20of%20Black%20Origin%20Awards">MOBO Awards</a> in the UK. The following year, it also received two nominations for the Best R&B/Urban Dance Track and Best Pop Dance Track at the <a href="Winter%20Music%20Conference">22nd Annual International Dance Music Awards</a> in 2007. The writers of "<a href="Rap-Up">Rap-Up</a>" magazine put the song at number ten on their list of the ten best singles of 2006. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of <a href="E%21%20Online">E! Online</a> placed the song at number six on their list of ten best Beyoncé's songs. In a 2013 list of Jay-Z's 20 Biggest "Billboard" Hits, "Déjà Vu" was ranked at number 19.

"Déjà Vu" debuted on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart at number 44, less than a month before its physical release. After the release of the digital and physical components, the song sold 75,000 downloads in its first week. It eventually peaked at number four on the Hot 100 chart. The track's Freemasons/M. Joshua remix topped the US <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Hot Dance Club Play</a> chart, while the album version peaked at number 18 on the same component chart. "Déjà Vu" also reached the top spot of the <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Singles%20Sales">Hot Dance Singles Sales</a> and <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> charts, number nine on the <a href="Rhythmic%20Airplay%20Chart">Rhythmic Top 40</a> chart, and number 14 on the <a href="Mainstream%20Top%2040%20%28Pop%20Songs%29">Top 40 Mainstream</a> chart.

"Déjà Vu" reached the top 10 in eight European countries. Having sold 29,365 units on its first week, the single made its debut at number one on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, becoming Beyoncé's second solo number-one single in the UK. The single reached the top five in Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland and entered the top 10 in Belgium, Finland, and Germany. In Oceania, "Déjà Vu" peaked on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian Singles Chart</a> at number 12, and on the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand Singles Chart</a> at number 15. "Déjà Vu" emerged as the 98th best-selling single in Australia in 2006.

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "Déjà Vu" was filmed by British director <a href="Sophie%20Muller">Sophie Muller</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> on June 21, 2006, with parts of the video shot at the <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Bar">Maple Leaf Bar</a> and the <a href="Oak%20Alley%20Plantation">Oak Alley Plantation</a> in <a href="Carrollton%2C%20Louisiana">Carrollton, Louisiana</a> and <a href="Vacherie%2C%20Louisiana">Vacherie, Louisiana</a> respectively. The footage features couture-inspired outfits, vigorous footwork and sexually-themed routines. The video simultaneously premiered on July 12, 2006 on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s show "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" ("TRL"), and <a href="MTV%20Overdrive">Overdrive</a>, MTV's broadband video channel. It reached the top spot on the "TRL", Yahoo!, and MTV countdowns. The "Deja Vu" video topped the UK TV airplay chart in late July 2006.
The video begins with showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z sitting on a chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to simultaneously play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At the end of the chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.

Reactions to the video were mixed. Sal Cinquemani of <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> commented it is "more thematic and thought provoking than the videos for '<a href="Baby%20Boy%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles%20song%29">Baby Boy</a>' and '<a href="Naughty%20Girl%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles%20song%29">Naughty Girl</a>'", Beyoncé's songs from her debut album, "<a href="Dangerously%20in%20Love">Dangerously in Love</a>". Allhiphop's Eb Haynes described the video "visually fresh" and "couture motivated". A news article published by "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" reported that a particular scene in the video is suggestive of <a href="oral%20sex">oral sex</a>. Natalie Y. Moore of "<a href="In%20These%20Times">In These Times</a>" magazine echoed the latter's commentary, writing that the video showcases Beyoncé "strutting her sexuality", and that in Jay-Z's scenes it "looks as if any minute now she'll give him <a href="fellatio">fellatio</a>". The video later appeared on a list of <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a> News' Worst Videos of All Time, which pointed to the negative fan reaction and stated, "It's probably the least horrific video listed ... but as far as Beyoncé videos go, it is a stinker."

According to an <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a> staff report, as of July 2006, more than two thousand people had signed an online petition addressed to Beyoncé's record label, Columbia, demanding a reshoot for the video. By the end of August 2006, 5000 additional fans had signed it. The petition requested the clip to be taped again because it was considered to be "an underwhelming representation of the talent and quality of previous music-video projects of Ms. Beyoncé". Included in the laundry list of offenses were "a lack of theme, dizzying editing, over-the-top wardrobe choices, and unacceptable interactions" between Beyoncé and her now-husband, Jay-Z. Beyoncé's dance moves were also called into question by the petition, qualifying them as "erratic, confusing and alarming at times". Additionally, fans complained about the sexual theme depicted in the video, describing that some scenes as "unacceptable interactions [between Beyoncé and Jay-Z]" while also complaining of a "non-existent sexual chemistry" between the two. The music video was awarded Best Video at the 2006 <a href="Music%20of%20Black%20Origin%20Awards">MOBO Awards</a>. It also received two nominations for Sexiest Video and Best Hook-Up at the <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Video%20Music%20Awards%202007">2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards</a>.

"Déjà Vu" was performed by Beyoncé at the <a href="BET%20Awards%202006">2006 BET Awards</a> on June 27 at the <a href="Shrine%20Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a>. The show was opened with a performance of the song and Jay-Z joined Beyoncé onstage during the second half of the song. William Keck of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" commented that Beyoncé "sizzled in a revealing silver ensemble" as she performed the song. She also performed "Déjà Vu" at the <a href="Fashion%20Rocks">Fashion Rocks</a> on September 8, 2006. According to Farrah Weinstein of <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>, Beyoncé's performance of the song was billed as a tribute to <a href="Josephine%20Baker">Josephine Baker</a>, and both her stage set and outfit were in homage to the singer and dancer. The set was designed like an old <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> club, complete with male dancers bearing saxophones, and both Beyoncé and her female dancers wore Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. She performed the song on the American <a href="breakfast%20television">morning news and talk show</a>, "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>" during an episode which aired on September 8, 2006. Beyoncé also performed the song at "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" on September 9, 2006, and at "<a href="The%20Tyra%20Banks%20Show">The Tyra Banks Show</a>" on September 15, 2006. At the <a href="2006%20World%20Music%20Awards">2006 World Music Awards</a> on November 15, 2006, Beyoncé opened the show with a performance of "Déjà Vu".

In addition to her live performances of "Déjà Vu" in awards ceremonies and televised shows, the song was included on the <a href="set%20list">set list</a> for her tours <a href="The%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20Experience">The Beyoncé Experience</a> and <a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour">I Am... World Tour</a>. John Aizlewood of "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" described the performance of the song during The Beyoncé Experience as "head-spinning". During Beyoncé's performance of "Déjà Vu" at a concert in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> on August 25, 2007, she had a <a href="wardrobe%20malfunction">wardrobe malfunction</a> as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. <a href="Ann%20Powers">Ann Powers</a> of "Los Angeles Times" discussed about the malfunction, saying: "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect... [a] 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." During the I Am... World Tour, Beyoncé did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of "Déjà Vu" after her entrance on stage. During the <a href="revue">revue</a> <a href="I%20Am...%20Yours">I Am... Yours</a> which was a part of the tour, Beyoncé performed a jazz medley of "Déjà Vu", "<a href="It%20Don%27t%20Mean%20a%20Thing%20%28If%20It%20Ain%27t%20Got%20That%20Swing%29">It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)</a>" and "<a href="Bootylicious">Bootylicious</a>" and continued with a full version of the first song. Concert performances of "Déjà Vu" were included on her live albums "<a href="The%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20Experience%20Live">The Beyoncé Experience Live</a>" (2007), "" (2009) and "<a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour%20%28album%29">I Am... World Tour</a>" (2010).
Beyoncé performed Déjà Vu during her <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9%202018%20Coachella%20performance">2018 Coachella Performances</a> on April 14 and April 21, 2018 with a guest appearance by <a href="Jay-Z">Jay Z</a>, along with a live orchrestra. It had been more than 8 years since she last performed the song.

On January 31, 2009 <a href="Jade%20Ewen">Jade Ewen</a> performed the song during the "" show. Her performance was described as "a show-stopping – and aptly chosen – rendition [of the original]" by Cher Thornhill of "Daily Mail". During the finale of the <a href="American%20Idol%20%28season%2010%29">tenth season</a> of "<a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a>" on May 25, 2011, the lady contestants joined together onstage to perform "Déjà Vu" along with a medley of Beyoncé's other hit singles.

Blakeney Point

Blakeney Point (designated as Blakeney National Nature Reserve) is a <a href="National%20Nature%20Reserves%20in%20England">National Nature Reserve</a> situated near to the villages of <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a>, <a href="Morston">Morston</a> and <a href="Cley%20next%20the%20Sea">Cley next the Sea</a> on the north coast of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England. Its main feature is a 6.4 km (4 mi) <a href="spit%20%28landform%29">spit</a> of <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> and <a href="dune">sand dunes</a>, but the reserve also includes <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es, tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland. It has been managed by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> since 1912, and lies within the <a href="North%20Norfolk%20Coast%20Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, which is additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA), <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings. The reserve is part of both an <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB), and a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">World Biosphere Reserve</a>. The Point has been studied for more than a century, following pioneering <a href="ecology">ecological</a> studies by botanist <a href="Francis%20Wall%20Oliver">Francis Wall Oliver</a> and a <a href="bird%20ringing">bird ringing</a> programme initiated by ornithologist <a href="Emma%20Turner%20%28photographer%29">Emma Turner</a>.

The area has a long history of human occupation; ruins of a <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="monastery">monastery</a> and "<a href="Blakeney%20Chapel">Blakeney Chapel</a>" (probably a domestic dwelling) are buried in the marshes. The towns sheltered by the shingle spit were once important harbours, but <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a> schemes starting in the 17th century resulted in the silting up of the river channels. The reserve is important for breeding birds, especially <a href="tern">tern</a>s, and its location makes it a major site for <a href="bird%20migration">migrating birds</a> in autumn. Up to 500 <a href="pinniped">seals</a> may gather at the end of the spit, and its sand and shingle hold a number of specialised <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s and plants, including the edible <a href="Salicornia%20europaea">samphire</a>, or "sea asparagus".

The many visitors who come to <a href="birdwatching">birdwatch</a>, <a href="sailing">sail</a> or for other outdoor recreations are important to the local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. The spit is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward. The <a href="River%20Glaven">River Glaven</a> can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, <a href="Cley%20Marshes">Cley Marshes</a> nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.

Blakeney Point, like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of <a href="Cley%20next%20the%20Sea">Cley next the Sea</a>. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to <a href="Weybourne%2C%20Norfolk">Weybourne</a>. It is approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20 m (65 ft) in width and up to 10 m (33 feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3 million m (82 million ft) of shingle in the spit, 97 per cent of which is derived from <a href="flint">flint</a>.

The Point was formed by <a href="longshore%20drift">longshore drift</a> and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1 m (433 ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from the air of a series of hooks along the south side of the spit. <a href="Salt%20marshes">Salt marshes</a> have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and <a href="dune">sand dunes</a> have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.

<a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20Path">Norfolk Coast Path</a>, an ancient <a href="long%20distance%20footpath">long distance footpath</a>, cuts across the south eastern corner of the reserve along the <a href="seawall">sea wall</a> between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at <a href="Holme-next-the-Sea">Holme-next-the-Sea</a> the trail joins <a href="Peddars%20Way">Peddars Way</a>. The tip of Blakeney Point can be reached by walking up the shingle spit from the car park at Cley Beach, or by boats from the quay at <a href="Morston">Morston</a>. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a <a href="lifeboat%20%28rescue%29">lifeboat</a> station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a look-out for <a href="smuggling">smugglers</a>, it was used in succession as a <a href="coast%20guard">coast guard</a> station, by the <a href="Girl%20Guides">Girl Guides</a>, and as a holiday let.

Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the <a href="Paleolithic">Palaeolithic</a>, and has produced many significant <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> finds. Both <a href="anatomically%20modern%20humans">modern</a> and <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a>, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the very cold conditions that existed then, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> (10,000–5,000 BCE), the <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> rose, filling what is now the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as <a href="Doggerland">Doggerland</a>. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic <a href="Blade%20%28archaeology%29">long blades</a> up to long found on the present-day coast at <a href="Titchwell%20Marsh">Titchwell Marsh</a> date from a time when it was from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> (50,000–10,000 BCE) to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> (5,000–2,500 BCE).

An "eye" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings. Blakeney's former <a href="Carmelites">Carmelite</a> <a href="monastery">friary</a>, founded in 1296 and <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolved</a> in 1538, was built in such a location, and several fragments of plain roof tile and <a href="pantile%20%28roof%20material%29">pantiles</a> dating back to the 13th century have been found near the site of its ruins. Originally on the south side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as "<a href="Blakeney%20Chapel">Blakeney Chapel</a>", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century. Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent, suggesting significant international trade at this time.

The spit sheltered the <a href="River%20Glaven">Glaven ports</a>, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and <a href="Wiveton">Wiveton</a>, which were important <a href="medieval">medieval</a> harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I's</a> war efforts in 1301, and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only Norfolk port between <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a> and <a href="Great%20Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a> to have customs officials. <a href="St%20Nicholas%2C%20Blakeney">Blakeney Church</a> has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the <a href="Blakeney%20Haven">haven</a>, including a <a href="Carvel%20%28boat%20building%29">carvel-built</a> wooden ship.

<a href="Land%20reclamation">Land reclamation</a> schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's <a href="wharf">wharf</a>. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, <a href="Thomas%20Telford">Thomas Telford</a> was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. <a href="Packet%20ship">Packet ship</a>s ran to <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a> and <a href="London">London</a> from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.
In the decades preceding <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, this stretch of coast became famous for its <a href="waterfowl%20hunting">wildfowling</a>; locals were looking for food, but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds; Norfolk's first <a href="barred%20warbler">barred warbler</a> was shot on the point in 1884. In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its "watcher", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.

In 1910, the owner of the Point, <a href="Baron%20Calthorpe">Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe</a>, leased the land to <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by <a href="Charles%20Rothschild">Charles Rothschild</a> and organised by UCL Professor <a href="Francis%20Wall%20Oliver">Francis Wall Oliver</a> and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the <a href="tern">tern</a> colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.

The Point was designated as a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent <a href="Cley%20Marshes">Cley Marshes</a> reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings, <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> category IV (habitat/species management area) and is part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. The Point became a <a href="National%20Nature%20Reserve">National Nature Reserve</a> (NNR) in 1994, and the coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with <a href="Scolt%20Head%20Island">Scolt Head Island</a>, became a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">Biosphere Reserve</a> in 1976.

Blakeney Point has been designated as one of the most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's <a href="Joint%20Nature%20Conservation%20Committee">Joint Nature Conservation Committee</a>. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of <a href="common%20tern">common</a> and <a href="little%20tern">little tern</a>s were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. <a href="Sandwich%20tern">Sandwich tern</a>s were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eight per cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed gull</a>s sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of <a href="Arctic%20tern">Arctic tern</a>s and a few <a href="Mediterranean%20gull">Mediterranean gull</a>s in the tern colony, <a href="common%20ringed%20plover">ringed plovers</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20oystercatcher">oystercatchers</a> on the shingle and <a href="common%20redshank">common redshank</a>s on the salt marsh. The <a href="wader">wader</a>s' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="least%20weasel">weasels</a> and <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding <a href="northern%20lapwing">northern lapwing</a>s, and species such as <a href="sedge%20warbler">sedge</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20reed%20warbler">reed warblers</a> and <a href="bearded%20tit">bearded tit</a>s are found in patches of <a href="phragmites">common reed</a>.

The Point juts into the sea on a north-facing coast, which means that <a href="bird%20migration">migrant birds</a> may be found in spring and autumn, sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large "falls", such as the hundreds of <a href="European%20robin">European robin</a>s on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 <a href="common%20redstart">common redstart</a>s, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like <a href="greenish%20warbler">greenish warbler</a>s, <a href="great%20grey%20shrike">great grey shrike</a>s or <a href="Richard%27s%20pipit">Richard's pipit</a>s. <a href="Seabird">Seabird</a>s may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. <a href="vagrant%20species">Vagrant rarities</a> have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a <a href="Fea%27s%20petrel">Fea's</a> or <a href="Zino%27s%20petrel">Zino's petrel</a> in 1997, a <a href="trumpeter%20finch">trumpeter finch</a> in 2008, and an <a href="alder%20flycatcher">alder flycatcher</a> in 2010. <a href="Ornithology">Ornithologist</a> and pioneering bird photographer <a href="Emma%20Turner%20%28photographer%29">Emma Turner</a> started <a href="bird%20ringing">ringing</a> common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a <a href="Radde%27s%20warbler">Radde's warbler</a> trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold <a href="European%20golden%20plover">golden plover</a>s and <a href="wildfowl">wildfowl</a> including <a href="common%20shelduck">common shelduck</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a>, <a href="brant%20goose">brent geese</a> and <a href="common%20teal">common teal</a>, while <a href="common%20scoter">common scoter</a>s, <a href="common%20eider">common eider</a>s, <a href="common%20goldeneye">common goldeneye</a>s and <a href="red-breasted%20merganser">red-breasted merganser</a>s swim offshore.

Blakeney Point has a mixed colony of about 500 <a href="Harbor%20seal">harbour</a> and <a href="grey%20seal">grey seal</a>s. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, may be seen on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are restricted to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a <a href="ducted%20propeller">ducted propeller</a>.

The <a href="European%20rabbit">rabbit</a> population can grow to a level at which their grazing and burrowing adversely affects the fragile dune vegetation. When rabbit numbers are reduced by <a href="myxomatosis">myxomatosis</a>, the plants recover, although those that are toxic to rabbits, like <a href="Jacobaea%20vulgaris">ragwort</a>, then become less common due to increased competition from the edible species. The rabbits may be killed by <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s such as red foxes, weasels and stoats. Records of mammals that are rare in the NNR area include <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> swimming in the haven, a <a href="European%20hedgehog">hedgehog</a> and a beached <a href="Sowerby%27s%20beaked%20whale">Sowerby's beaked whale</a>.

An insect survey in September 2009 recorded 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the <a href="rove%20beetle">rove beetle</a> "<a href="Phytosus%20nigriventris">Phytosus nigriventris</a>" and the <a href="Cucujoidea">fungus beetle</a> "<a href="Leiodes%20ciliaris">Leiodes ciliaris</a>", and two very rarely seen in the county, the <a href="sap%20beetle">sap beetle</a> "<a href="Nitidula%20carnaria">Nitidula carnaria</a>" and the <a href="Histeridae">clown beetle</a> "<a href="Gnathoncus%20nanus">Gnathoncus nanus</a>". There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare" <a href="Myrmica%20specioides">Myrmica specioides</a>". The rare <a href="millipede">millipede</a> "<a href="Thalassisobates%20littoralis">Thalassisobates littoralis</a>", a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a <a href="red-veined%20darter">red-veined darter</a> appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant <a href="turnip%20sawfly">turnip sawflies</a> were recorded for a few days in late summer 2006, along with <a href="Red-eyed%20damselfly">red-eyed damselflies</a>. The <a href="silver%20Y">silver Y</a> moth also appears in large numbers in some years.

The many inhabitants of the tidal flats include <a href="lugworm">lugworm</a>s, <a href="polychaete">polychaete worms</a>, <a href="Talitrus%20saltator">sand hoppers</a> and other <a href="amphipoda">amphipod crustaceans</a>, and <a href="gastropoda">gastropod molluscs</a>. These <a href="mollusca">molluscs</a> feed on the <a href="algae">algae</a> growing on the surface of the mud, and include the tiny "<a href="Hydrobia%20ulvae">Hydrobia</a>", an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000 m. <a href="Bivalvia">Bivalve molluscs</a> include the edible <a href="Cerastoderma%20edule">common cockle</a>, although it is not harvested here.

Grasses such as <a href="Agropyron%20pungens">sea couch grass</a> and <a href="Puccinellia%20maritima">sea poa grass</a> have an important function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where <a href="Ammophila%20arenaria">marram grass</a>, <a href="Elymus%20farctus">sand couch-grass</a>, <a href="Leymus%20arenarius">lyme-grass</a> and <a href="Corynephorus%20canescens">grey hair-grass</a> help to bind the sand. <a href="Eryngium%20maritimum">Sea holly</a>, <a href="Carex%20arenaria">sand sedge</a>, <a href="Lotus%20corniculatus">bird's-foot trefoil</a> and <a href="pyramidal%20orchid">pyramidal orchid</a> are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised <a href="moss">moss</a>es and <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution is influenced by the dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic <a href="humus">humus</a> from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with <a href="bryophyte">mosses</a> and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. <a href="introduced%20species">Non-native</a> <a href="lupinus%20arboreus">tree lupins</a> have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.

The shingle ridge attracts <a href="Sedum%20acre">biting stonecrop</a>, <a href="Silene%20maritima">sea campion</a>, <a href="Glaucium%20flavum">yellow horned poppy</a>, <a href="Armeria%20maritima">sea thrift</a>, bird's foot trefoil and <a href="sea%20beet">sea beet</a>. In the damper areas, where the shingle adjoins salt marsh, <a href="Limonium%20binervosum">rock sea lavender</a>, <a href="Limonium%20bellidifolium">matted sea lavender</a> and <a href="Suaeda%20vera">scrubby sea-blite</a> also thrive, although they are scarce in Britain away from the Norfolk coast. The saltmarsh contains <a href="Salicornia%20europaea">European glasswort</a> and <a href="Spartina%20anglica">common cord grass</a> in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first <a href="Aster%20tripolium">sea aster</a>, then mainly sea lavender, with <a href="Halimione%20portulacoides">sea purslane</a> in the creeks, and smaller areas of <a href="Plantago%20maritima">sea plantain</a> and other common marsh plants. Six previously unknown <a href="diatom">diatom</a> species were found in the waters around the point in 1952, along with six others not previously recorded in Britain.

European glasswort is picked between May and September and sold locally as "samphire". It is a fleshy plant which when blanched or steamed has a taste which leads to its alternative name of "sea asparagus", and it is often eaten with fish. It can also be eaten raw when young. Glasswort is also a favourite food for the rabbits, which will venture onto the saltmarsh in search of this succulent plant.

The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest "per capita" spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, <a href="sailing">sailing</a> and walking are the other significant <a href="tourism">tourist activities</a> in the area.

The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.

The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its <a href="hinterland">hinterland</a> into three zones for tourism development purposes. Blakeney Point, along with <a href="Holme%20Dunes">Holme Dunes</a> and <a href="Holkham%20National%20Nature%20Reserve">Holkham dunes</a>, is considered to be a sensitive habitat already suffering from visitor pressure, and therefore designated as a red-zone area with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the reserve is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.

The spit is a relatively young feature in <a href="geology">geological</a> terms, and in recent centuries it has been extending westwards and landwards through tidal and storm action. This growth is thought to have been enhanced by the reclamation of the salt marshes along this coast in recent centuries, which removed a natural barrier to the movement of shingle. The amount of shingle moved by a single storm can be "spectacular"; the spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again. The northernmost part of Snitterley (now Blakeney) village was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm. In the last two hundred years, maps have been accurate enough for the distance from the Blakeney Chapel ruins to the sea to be measured. The 400 m (440 yd) in 1817 had become 320 m (350 yd) by 1835, 275 m (300 yd) in 1907, and 195 m (215 yd) by the end of the 20th century. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m (1 yd) per year; and several former raised islands or "eyes" have already disappeared, first covered by the advancing shingle, and then lost to the sea. The massive <a href="North%20Sea%20flood%20of%201953">1953 flood</a> overran the main beach, and only the highest dune tops remained above water. Sand was washed into the salt marshes, and the extreme tip of the point was breached, but as with other purely natural parts of the coast, like Scolt Head Island, little lasting damage was done.

Landward movement of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting to hold back the shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550 m (600 yd) stretch of river 200 m (220 yd) further south was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5 million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30 years.

Minnie Pwerle

Minnie Pwerle (also Minnie Purla or Minnie Motorcar Apwerl; born between 1910 and 1922 – 18 March 2006) was an Australian <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> artist. She came from <a href="Utopia%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Utopia, Northern Territory</a> ("Unupurna" in local language), a cattle station in the Sandover area of <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a> northeast of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>.

Minnie began painting in 2000 at about the age of 80, and her pictures soon became popular and sought-after works of <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a>. In the years after she took up <a href="acrylic%20paint">painting on canvas</a> until she died in 2006, Minnie's works were exhibited around Australia and collected by major galleries, including the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a> and the <a href="Queensland%20Art%20Gallery">Queensland Art Gallery</a>. With popularity came pressure from those keen to acquire her work. She was allegedly "kidnapped" by people who wanted her to paint for them, and there have been media reports of her work being forged. Minnie's work is often compared with that of her sister-in-law <a href="Emily%20Kame%20Kngwarreye">Emily Kame Kngwarreye</a>, who also came from the Sandover and took up acrylic painting late in life. Minnie's daughter, <a href="Barbara%20Weir">Barbara Weir</a>, is a respected artist in her own right.

Minnie was born in the early 20th century near <a href="Utopia%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Utopia, Northern Territory</a>, north-east of <a href="Alice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Alice Springs, Northern Territory</a>. Utopia was a <a href="cattle%20station">cattle station</a> that was returned to Indigenous ownership in the late 1970s. It is part of a broader region known as the Sandover, containing about 20 Indigenous <a href="outstation">outstation</a>s and centred on the Sandover River. Minnie was one of the traditional owners of Utopia station recognised in the 1980 Indigenous <a href="native%20title">land claim</a> made over the property; her particular country was known as Atnwengerrp.

"Pwerle" (in the <a href="Anmatyerre">Anmatyerre</a> language) or "Apwerle" (in <a href="Alyawarr">Alyawarr</a>) is a <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship">skin name</a>, one of 16 used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the <a href="kinship%20system">kinship system</a> of central Australian <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous</a> people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners, and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus "Minnie" is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria estimates around 1915; Birnberg's biographical survey of Indigenous artists from central Australia gives a birth date of around 1920; "The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art" suggests around 1922; Elizabeth Fortescue's biographical essay in "Art of Utopia" offers a range between 1910 and 1920. The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth by comparison with other events, especially for those born before contact with European Australians. Minnie was one of six children, and had three sisters: Molly, born around 1920, Emily, born around 1922, and Galya, born in the 1930s. She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages">Aboriginal language groups</a>.

In about 1945, Minnie had an affair with a married man, Jack Weir, described by one source as a pastoral station owner, by a second as "an Irish Australian man who owned a cattle run called Bundy River Station", and by another as an Irish "stockman". A relationship such as that between Minnie and Weir was illegal, and the pair were jailed; Weir died shortly after his release. Minnie had a child from their liaison, who was partly raised by Minnie's sister-in-law, artist <a href="Emily%20Kngwarreye">Emily Kngwarreye</a>, and became prominent Indigenous artist <a href="Barbara%20Weir">Barbara Weir</a>. Barbara Weir was one of the <a href="Stolen%20Generations">Stolen Generations</a>. At about the age of nine, she was forcibly taken from her family, who believed she had then been killed. The family were reunited in the late 1960s, but Barbara did not form a close bond with Minnie. Barbara married Mervyn Torres, and as of 2000 had six children and thirteen grandchildren.

Minnie went on to have six further children with her husband "Motorcar" Jim Ngala, including Aileen, Betty, Raymond and Dora Mpetyane, and two others who by 2010 had died. Her grandchildren include Fred Torres, who founded <a href="art%20museum">private art gallery</a> DACOU in 1993, and artist Teresa Purla (or Pwerle).

Minnie began painting in late 1999 or 2000, when she was almost 80. When asked why she had not begun earlier (painting and batik works had been created at Utopia for over 20 years), her daughter Barbara Weir reported Minnie's answer as being that "no-one had asked her". By the 2000s, she was reported as living at Alparra, the largest of Utopia's communities, or at Urultja (also Irrultja, again in the Sandover region). Sprightly and outgoing, even in her eighties she could outrun younger women chasing <a href="goanna">goanna</a>s for bushfood, and she continued to create art works until two days before her death on 18 March 2006. She was outlived by all her sisters except Maggie Pwerle, mother of artists <a href="Gloria%20Petyarre">Gloria</a> and <a href="Kathleen%20Petyarre">Kathleen Petyarre</a> (or Pitjara).

In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became well known for the design and production of <a href="batik">batik</a>s. By 1981 there were 50 artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the <a href="Central%20Australian%20Aboriginal%20Media%20Association">Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association</a>. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests that she did not participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.
When Minnie decided to take up painting in 2000 while she waited for her daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20and%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a> in 2002. One of her pieces, "Awelye Atnwengerrp", was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts. Her painting "Awelye Atnwengerrp 2" was exhibited in the 2005 competition.
She was named by "<a href="Australian%20Art%20Collector">Australian Art Collector</a>" as one of Australia's 50 most collectible artists in 2004.

There were many group and solo exhibitions of Minnie's work at private galleries between 2000 and 2006. These included exhibitions at Japinka Gallery in Western Australia in 2003 and 2005, Adelaide's Dacou Gallery in 2000 and 2002, Sydney's Gallery Savah between 2000 and 2002 as well as in 2006, and Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery in 2000, 2004 and 2006, the last of which was a joint exhibition conducted with her three sisters, all of whom are artists in their own right.

Desert art specialist Professor <a href="Vivien%20Johnson">Vivien Johnson</a> noted that Minnie was one of the Utopia artists whose style was "radically different from [that of] all the other painting communities in the Western Desert—and stunningly successful in the market place". Her most famous fellow artist was Emily Kngwarreye, whose painting "<a href="Earth%27s%20Creation">Earth's Creation</a>" in 2007 sold for over $1 million, setting a record for the price paid for a painting by an Indigenous Australian artist. Unlike Minnie, Emily had been an active participant in the early batik movement at Utopia.

Minnie (like Emily) was often placed under considerable pressure to produce works. She was reportedly "kidnapped" by people "keen to go to often quite bizarre lengths to acquire" her work. Minnie's experience reflected broader issues in the industry surrounding artists, who were often older, had limited education or English language ability, and faced serious poverty both themselves and amongst their families. In addition to being pressured to paint by others, there were media reports suggesting that some of the vast number of paintings traded under Minnie's name were not created by her at all.

Minnie's style was spontaneous, and typified by "bold" and "vibrant" colour executed with great freedom. Her works, such as "Anunapa, Akali" held by the National Gallery of Victoria, were executed in <a href="acrylic%20paint">acrylic</a> (often referred to as synthetic polymer) paint on canvas. As with other contemporary artists of the central and western deserts, her paintings included depictions of stories or features for which she had responsibility within her family or clan, such as the Awelye Atnwengerrp <a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreaming</a> (or "Women's Dreaming"). Indigenous art expert Jenny Green believes Minnie's work continues the tradition of "<a href="Action%20painting">gestural abstractionism</a>" established by Emily Kngwarreye, which contrasted with the use of recognisable traditional motifs—such as animal tracks—in the works of <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a> artists. Brisbane artist and gallerist <a href="Michael%20Eather">Michael Eather</a> has likened her work not only to that of Emily, but also to Australian <a href="abstract%20impressionism">abstract impressionist</a> artist <a href="Tony%20Tuckson">Tony Tuckson</a>.

Minnie's paintings include two main design themes. The first is free-flowing and parallel lines in a pendulous outline, depicting the <a href="body%20painting">body painting</a> designs used in women's ceremonies, or "awelye". The second theme involves circular shapes, used to symbolise <a href="bush%20tomato">bush tomato</a> ("<a href="Solanum%20chippendalei">Solanum chippendalei</a>"), bush melon, and northern wild orange ("<a href="Capparis">Capparis</a> umbonata"), among a number of forms of <a href="bushfood">bushfood</a> represented in her works. Together, the designs were characterised by one reviewer as "broad, luminescent flowing lines and circles".

Minnie's art was quickly added to major public collections such as the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20NSW">Art Gallery of NSW</a>, <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20South%20Australia">Art Gallery of South Australia</a>, <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a> and <a href="Queensland%20Art%20Gallery">Queensland Art Gallery</a>. It was also included in a 2009 exhibition of Indigenous Australian painting at the <a href="New%20York%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">New York Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. Her works later formed the basis of a series of designer rugs, and, together with paintings by her sisters, illustrated the cover of art critic Benjamin Genocchio's book, "Dollar Dreaming". Described by art dealer Hank Ebes as the works of "a genius", Minnie's paintings were typically selling for $5,000 in 2005; the highest price fetched on the secondary market at that time was $43,000.

Regarded as one of Australia's leading contemporary women artists, Minnie ranks alongside other notable Indigenous female painters <a href="Dorothy%20Napangardi">Dorothy Napangardi</a>, <a href="Gloria%20Petyarre">Gloria Petyarre</a> and <a href="Kathleen%20Petyarre">Kathleen Petyarre</a>. One of a number of women such as Emily Kngwarreye who dominated central and western desert painting in the first decade of the 21st century, Minnie is considered to be one of Australia's best-known Indigenous artists, whose work "the market couldn't get enough [of]".

Peter Jones (January 1, 1802 – June 29, 1856) was an <a href="Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a> <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> <a href="Minister%20of%20religion">minister</a>, <a href="translator">translator</a>, <a href="Tribal%20chief">chief</a> and author from <a href="Burlington%20Heights%20%28Ontario%29">Burlington Heights</a>, <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>. His <a href="Ojibwa%20language">Ojibwa</a> name was Kahkewāquonāby ("Gakiiwegwanebi" in the <a href="Ojibwe%20writing%20systems%23Double%20vowel%20system">Fiero spelling</a>), which means "[Sacred] Waving Feathers". In <a href="Mohawk%20language">Mohawk</a>, he was called Desagondensta, meaning "he stands people on their feet". In his youth his band of <a href="Mississaugas">Mississaugas</a> had been on the verge of destruction. As a preacher and a chieftain, as a role model and as a liaison to governments, his leadership helped his people survive contact with Europeans.

Jones was raised by his mother <a href="Tuhbenahneequay">Tuhbenahneequay</a> in the <a href="Midewiwin">traditional culture and religion</a> of the Mississauga Ojibwas until the age of 14. After that, he went to live with his father <a href="Augustus%20Jones">Augustus Jones</a>, a <a href="Wales">Welsh-born</a> <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalist">United Empire Loyalist</a>. There he learnt the customs and language of the <a href="White%20people">white</a> <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm. Jones converted to <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodism</a> at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister. Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher. As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in <a href="Anishinaabe%20language">Ojibwe</a> and <a href="Mohawk%20language">Mohawk</a> and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English. Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches. Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he had worked so hard to become.

Jones was also a political leader. In 1825, he wrote to the <a href="Indian%20Department">Indian Department</a>; his letter was the first the department had ever received from an Indian. This brought him into contact with Superintendent of the Indian Department <a href="James%20Givins">James Givins</a> and influential Bishop <a href="John%20Strachan">John Strachan</a>, with whom he arranged the funding and support of the <a href="Credit%20Mission">Credit Mission</a>. There he lived and worked as a preacher and community leader, leading the conversion of Mississaugas to a European lifestyle of agriculture and Christianity, which enabled them to compete with the <a href="european%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">white settlers</a> of Upper Canada. He was elected a chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission in 1829 and acted as a spokesman for the band when petitioning the colonial government and its departments. During his British tours, he had audiences with <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, directly petitioning the latter on the issue of title deeds for the Mississaugas of Upper Canada. During his life, Jones did manage to obtain some concessions from various provincial governments, such as having control over the trust funds for the Mississaugas of Credit turned over to their chiefs, but he was never able to secure title deeds for the Credit settlement. In 1847, Jones led the band to relocate to <a href="New%20Credit">New Credit</a> on land donated by the <a href="Six%20Nations%20of%20the%20Grand%20River%20First%20Nation">Six Nations</a>, who were able to furnish the Mississaugas with title deeds. The Mississaugas of New Credit have since been able to retain title to the land, where they remain. Jones' health had been declining for several years before the move to New Credit, and he was unable to accompany them to an unconstructed settlement, retiring to a nearby estate outside of <a href="Brantford%2C%20Ontario">Brantford, Canada West</a>, where he died in the summer of 1856.

Jones was born on January 1, 1802 in Burlington Heights, Upper Canada. His father was <a href="Augustus%20Jones">Augustus Jones</a>, an <a href="United%20States">American born</a> surveyor of <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh descent</a>. His mother was <a href="Tuhbenahneequay">Tuhbenahneequay</a>, a <a href="Mississaugas">Mississauga</a> woman whose band inhabited the area. His father worked as a surveyor in the land the British planned to settle on; as was common among the European men who worked far from European settlements, he adopted the Indian custom of <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>. While at his <a href="Stoney%20Creek%2C%20Ontario">Stoney Creek</a> farm he lived with his legal wife, a <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk</a> woman named Sarah Tekarihogan, and while away surveying he lived with Tuhbenahneequay. While both the Mississaugas and Mohawks approved of polygamy, the white Christian settlers did not, and Augustus Jones ended his relationship with Tuhbenahneequay in 1802. Peter and his elder brother <a href="John%20Jones%20%28Ojibwa%20chief%29">John</a> were raised by Tuhbenahneequay in the "<a href="Midewiwin">Midewiwin</a>" religion, customs and lifestyle of their Mississauga ancestors, and learned to <a href="hunting">hunt</a> and <a href="Fishing">fish</a> to support themselves.

He was named "Kahkewāquonāby" by his maternal grandfather, Chief <a href="Wahbanosay">Wahbanosay</a>, during a dedicated feast. A son of Wahbanosay's who had died at age seven had been given the same name. The name translates into English as "[sacred] waving feathers" and denotes feathers plucked from the <a href="eagle">eagle</a>, which was sacred to the Mississaugas. This put him under the guardianship of the Mississauga's <a href="thunderbird%20%28mythology%29">"animikii" (thunderbird)</a> "<a href="manidoo">manidoo</a>", as the eagle represented this "manidoo". His mother was of the <a href="Anishinaabe%20clan%20system%23Eagle">Eagle totem</a> and the name belonged to that totem. At the feast Kahkewāquonāby was given a club to denote the power of the thunder spirit, and a bunch of eagle feathers to denote its flight.

Around 1811, Jones was adopted by Captain Jim, a Mississauga chief. Captain Jim's own son, also named Kahkewāquonāby, had died, and he petitioned Tuhbenahneequay to adopt Jones. Tuhbenahneequay approved the adoption, and Jones was sent to the Credit River to live with Captain Jim as one of his own children. During a long episode of drunken frolicking by all the adult Indians in Captain Jim's band, <a href="Starvation">hunger</a> and <a href="Hypothermia">exposure to the cold</a> crippled Jones, making him unable to stand. After two or three months of this, his mother received news of Jones' condition, and travelled to the Credit River with her relative Shegwahmaig ("Zhigwameg", "<a href="Bowfin">Marshfish</a>"). The two women carried Jones back to Stoney Creek, where he resumed living with his mother. His lameness subsided with time.

During the War of 1812, Jones' band of Mississaugas experienced a share of the War's hardship. Jones' grandmother Puhgashkish, old and crippled, had been left behind by the band when it was forced to flee the soldiers <a href="Battle%20of%20York">advancing on York</a>. She was never seen again. The band lost the warrior White John to the fighting, and several more were injured. Although Jones was too young to act as a warrior, he and his brother John visited the site of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stoney%20Creek">Battle of Stoney Creek</a> the day after the fighting, viewing the effects of battle firsthand. The land the band hunted and fished upon was beset with an influx of Indian refugees exceeding in number the population of the band. Jones went on his first <a href="vision%20quest">vision quest</a> about this time; his lack of visions caused him to question his faith in the Mississauga's religion. His faith was also troubled by the death of chief <a href="Kineubenae">Kineubenae</a> ("Giniw-bine", "Golden Eagle[-like Partridge]"). Golden Eagle was a respected elder of the band, who experienced a vision promising spirits would make him invincible to arrows and bullet. To renew the declining faith of his people, some of whom had begun to adopt the lifestyle of the white settlers, Golden Eagle arranged a demonstration of his spirit-granted invulnerability. He was killed attempting to catch a bullet with a tin pot. Jones witnessed the event.

In 1816, known as the <a href="Year%20Without%20a%20Summer">Year Without a Summer</a>, severe climate abnormalities caused an abysmal harvest, and the Mississauga band at the head of Lake Ontario was disintegrating. In the preceding twenty years community leaders Head Chief Wabakinine, band spokesman Golden Eagle and Jones' grandfather Wahbanosay had died, and no new leaders had effectively assumed their roles. <a href="Alcoholism">Alcoholism</a> among the band members was rising. Many members had abandoned the band, travelling west to the <a href="Thames%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Thames River valley</a> or <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Grand River valley</a> which were more isolated from white settlers.
Augustus Jones had learned of the band's troubles and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John to live with him at his farm in <a href="Saltfleet%20Township%2C%20Ontario">Saltfleet Township</a>, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. As he knew only a few words of English, Peter was enrolled in a <a href="one-room%20school">one-room school</a> in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to <a href="Brantford%2C%20Ontario">Brantford</a>, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name "Desagondensta", meaning "he stands people on their feet". Jones was <a href="baptism">baptised</a> <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and acting as if there was no God" convinced him there could be no truth in their religion. He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. He attended school in <a href="Fairchild%27s%20Creek%2C%20Ontario">Fairchild's Creek</a> during the winter of 1822–3 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>. In spring 1823, Jones left the school, returning to his father's farm that May.

Jones had been attracted to the Methodist faith because it advocated <a href="teetotalism">teetotalism</a> and that the Indians must convert to the white settler lifestyle. In June 1823, he attended a camp-meeting of the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal">Methodist Episcopal</a> Church in <a href="Ancaster%20Township%2C%20Ontario">Ancaster Township</a>, along with his half-sister Mary. The camp-meeting touched Jones, who converted there to Christianity. At this time Reverend <a href="William%20Case%20%28Methodist%20missionary%29">William Case</a> saw the potential to convert the Mississauga Indians through Jones. Case soon assumed the role of a mentor to Jones as a missionary. As Jones was bilingual and bicultural, he could speak to and relate to the Mississaugas and the white Christian settlers in Upper Canada. Later that year, Reverend <a href="Alvin%20Torry">Alvin Torry</a> set up a congregation centered around Jones and Chief <a href="Thomas%20Davis%20%28chief%29">Thomas Davis</a> (Tehowagherengaraghkwen) composed entirely of Indian members. The pair encouraged converted Indians to settle around Davis' home, which acquired the name "Davis' Hamlet" or "Davisville". Jones and Seth Crawford taught <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> for the growing community, which began building a chapel in the spring of 1824. Many of Jones' relatives were quickly converted and moved to Davis' Hamlet, including his mother Tuhbenahneequay, her daughter Wechikiwekapawiqua and Chief <a href="Wageezhegome">Wageezhegome</a> ("Wegiizhigomi", "Who Possesses the Day"), Wechikiwekapawiqua's husband and Jones' uncle Joseph Sawyer (Nawahjegezhegwabe ("Nawajii-giizhigwabi", "He who Rests Sitting upon the Sky")). Jones received his first official position in the church – exhorter – on March 1, 1825. In this role, he spoke at services after <a href="Methodist%20local%20preacher">local preachers</a> and assisted travelling preachers during their <a href="Circuit%20rider%20%28religious%29">circuit rides</a>. Church officials including Torry and Case recognised the need for a member fluent in Ojibwe who could translate hymns and bible passages, and present the Christian religion to the Indians in terms they could understand. Jones was put to work as a teacher at the Grand River mission. Around this time he began speaking to groups about Methodism. In 1824, a few of his relatives came to see him speak and stayed at the Grand River mission so they could enroll their children in Jones' day school. The Methodists of Upper Canada commissioned Jones, along with his brother John, to begin translating religious and instructive works in Ojibwe for use in the Methodists' schools. In 1825, over half his band had converted to Christianity, and Jones decided to devote his life to missionary work.

In 1825, Jones wrote a letter to Indian Agent <a href="James%20Givins">James Givins</a> regarding the year's delivery of gifts (due from various land purchases) to the Mississaugas. The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian. Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July. Jones arrived at the <a href="Humber%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Humber River</a> at the prescribed time, leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians, and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non-Christian Indians. At this meeting, a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones' band were converted. Givins was accompanied by several members of <a href="family%20compact">Upper Canada's aristocracy</a>, including Bishop <a href="John%20Strachan">John Strachan</a>. The Christian dress and style of Jones' band of converts, including their singing of hymns, which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones, created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present. Although Strachan, an Anglican, had strongly denounced the Methodists, he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada. He hoped to convert Jones (and thereby his followers) to Anglicanism later. The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on the Credit River for the Mississaugas in 1820, but nothing had been done. Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement, and after a short meeting, all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it. Construction of the settlement, called the "<a href="Credit%20Mission">Credit Mission</a>", was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826. By the summer of 1826, with construction of the settlement well under way, the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at the Credit Mission. Among the last holdouts was Jones' former adoptive father, Captain Jim, and his family. At about this time Methodist Reverend <a href="Egerton%20Ryerson">Egerton Ryerson</a> was assigned to the Credit Mission, and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him. Ryerson's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada. During the period 1825–27, Jones undertook missionary missions to <a href="Bay%20of%20Quinte">Quinte</a>, Munceytown, <a href="Rice%20Lake%2C%20Ontario">Rice Lake</a> and <a href="Lake%20Simcoe">Lake Simcoe</a>. He preached in the native language, a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity.

Jones' knowledge of English and ties to prominent settlers allowed him act as a spokesperson for the band. In 1825, he and his brother John had travelled to <a href="York%2C%20Upper%20Canada">York</a> to petition the government to end salmon fishing on the Credit river by European settlers; the petition would be granted in 1829. In 1826, they were back when the Indian Department failed to pay the full annuity due the band from an 1818 land concession, as the band had received only £472 of the £522 the treaty specified. In the settlement, Jones also worked to teach the residents farming practices, which few knew. Jones believed that the acceptance of Christianity by his people, and their conversion to an <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a> lifestyle, would be critical to their survival. By 1827, each family had a plot of their own, and a communal plot was farmed. The success of the settlement, and his success converting Indians to Christianity, gave Jones a good reputation in Upper Canada. His sermons while travelling were well attended, and various groups donated money and goods, such as a heating stove for the schoolhouse and a <a href="plough">plough</a> for the band. In 1827, Jones was granted a trial <a href="License%20to%20Preach%20%28Methodist%29">preaching license</a> as an <a href="Circuit%20rider%20%28religious%29">itinerant preacher</a>. By 1828, the Methodists' practice of teetotaling had made significant inroads with the Mississaugas; at the annual distribution of presents from the King in 1828, Jones reported seeing a single Indian drunk, while drunkenness had been widespread at the annual distribution as recently as 1826.

In January 1828, Bishop Strachan approached Jones and his brother John, offering to pay them more as Anglican missionaries than the Methodists could afford to, but both brothers declined the offer. At the same time, Strachan and various government officers applied pressure to the Indian communities to abandon Methodism for Anglicanism, refusing to assist the Rice Lake Indians with the construction of a settlement as they had done with the Credit and Bay of Quinte missions, even though the Rice Lake Indians offered to fund the construction from their land surrender annuities. Tension remained between the Upper Canada government and the province's Indians, including the Jones brothers in particular, over their religious affiliation until <a href="Peregrine%20Maitland">Lieutenant Governor Peregrine</a> was replaced in late 1828 with <a href="Sir%20John%20Colborne">Sir John Colborne</a>. Colborne looked far more favourably on the Methodists, but still hoped to replace the influence of American Methodists with British Wesleyans.

In 1829, the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission elected Jones one of their three chiefs, replacing the recently deceased <a href="John%20Cameron%20%28chief%29">John Cameron</a>. His election was influenced by his mastery of English; he was one of the few members of the band who could deal with missionaries and the provincial government. Jones continued his missionary work to other Indian bands of Upper Canada, converting many of the Mississaugas at <a href="Rice%20Lake%2C%20Ontario">Rice Lake</a> and at the <a href="Muncey%20Mission">Muncey Mission</a>, as well as Ojibwas around <a href="Lake%20Simcoe">Lake Simcoe</a> and the eastern shore of <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>. Along with his brother John, Jones began translating the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> into <a href="Ojibwa%20Language">Ojibwa</a>.

Also in 1829, Jones embarked on a tour of the northern United States with Reverend William Case and several Indian converts to raise money for the Methodist missions in Upper Canada. The tour raised £600, thirty percent of the Methodist Church's annual expenditures across <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>. After his return to Upper Canada, the year's annual Methodist conference named Jones "A Missionary to the Indian Tribes" on Case's urging. The 1830 conference gave him the same appointment. He was also ordained as a deacon then. Upper Canada's Methodists were in desperate need of money by 1831; that spring the church had been unable to pay all the salaries owed. To raise money for the church, Jones travelled with <a href="George%20Ryerson">George Ryerson</a> to the United Kingdom that spring where he gave more than sixty sermons and one hundred speeches which raised more than <a href="GBP">£</a>1000. These sermons were also held with Jones in Indian attire, which combined with his Indian name created curiosity and filled the halls, with four or five thousand attendees at his sermon for the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a>'s anniversary. Jones met with a number of prominent Englishmen, including <a href="James%20Cowles%20Prichard">James Cowles Prichard</a>, who treated him when he fell ill in June 1831, as well as Methodist leaders such as <a href="Adam%20Clarke">Adam Clarke</a>, <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a> and <a href="Richard%20Watson%20%28Methodist%29">Richard Watson</a>. This tour created significant public interest, and Jones met with <a href="King%20William%20IV">King William IV</a> on April 5, 1832, shortly before his return to Upper Canada.
During this tour, he met Eliza Field, to whom he proposed. She accepted, and Jones returned to Upper Canada in the spring of 1832. Field came to North America in 1833, arriving in New York City, where the pair married on September 8, 1833. Field had spent the intervening time learning domestic skills such as cooking and knitting to prepare for her new life. She came from a wealthy family and had previously been attended by servants. Field came to Upper Canada and worked along Jones in his ministry work and as a teacher in the Credit River settlement, instructing the Indian girls in sewing and other domestic skills. The Mississaugas of the Credit Mission dubbed Eliza "Kecheahgahmequa" ("Gichi-agaamiikwe", "the lady from beyond the [blue] waters"/"woman from across the great shore").

Jones' translation of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> was published in 1832, and around the same time he served as an editor for his brother John's translation of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>. Jones was <a href="ordain">ordain</a>ed a minister on October 6, 1833 by Reverend <a href="George%20Marsden%20%28Methodist%29">George Marsden</a> in York, Upper Canada. He was the first Ojibwa to be ordained as a Methodist preacher. The same year, the Canadian Methodists had unified their church with the British <a href="Methodist%20Church%20of%20Great%20Britain">Wesleyan</a>s. The combined church was now run by the British, and Jones was passed over for positions within the church in favour of less qualified individuals, and his influence lessened. When the position of head of the Canadian Indian missionaries came open, it was filled by a British Wesleyan with no experience with Indians, Reverend Joseph Stinson. William Case was given the second in command position, with special attention towards translating scriptures into Ojibwe. Case spoke no Ojibwe. Case, whom Jones had seen as a mentor, made his headquarters at the Credit Mission. Jones began to chaff in the church, as he was being given little responsibilities and the church showed no confidence in his abilities. Case told Methodist minister <a href="James%20Evans%20%28linguist%29">James Evans</a> to begin translating hymns and books of the Bible into Ojibwe, including those Jones had already translated. After the death of Augustus Jones in November 1836, Peter invited his stepmother and two youngest brothers to live at the Credit mission.

In the mid-1830s, <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Ontario">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Francis%20Bond%20Head">Francis Bond Head</a> devised a plan to relocate the Ojibwa of the Credit River, along with other Indian bands of southern Upper Canada, to <a href="Manitoulin%20Island">Manitoulin Island</a>. Bond Head believed that the Indians needed to be removed completely from the influence of the white settlers of Upper Canada. Jones, allied with Sir <a href="Augustus%20Frederick%20D%E2%80%99Este">Augustus Frederick D’Este</a> and Dr <a href="Thomas%20Hodgkin">Thomas Hodgkin</a> of the <a href="Aborigines%27%20Protection%20Society">Aborigines' Protection Society</a> in Britain, opposed the move. They knew the poor soil of Manitoulin Island would force the Indian Bands to abandon farming and return to a <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> lifestyle. After the surrender of the <a href="Saugeen%20tract">Saugeen tract</a>, protected by the <a href="Royal%20Proclamation%20of%201763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a>, Jones became convinced the only way to end the perpetual threat of relocation of the Mississaugas was to obtain <a href="title%20deed">title deed</a>s to their lands. Jones travelled to England in 1837 to petition the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> directly on the issue. He was accompanied by his wife and their niece <a href="Nahnebahwequa">Catherine Sunegoo</a>. The Colonial Secretary <a href="Lord%20Glenelg">Lord Glenelg</a> postponed meeting with Jones until the spring of 1838, as he was occupied with the <a href="Rebellions%20of%201837">Rebellions of 1837</a>. In the meantime, Glenelg refused to approve Bond Head's proposal. Jones spent the intervening time touring England, preaching, giving speeches and fundraising for the Canadian Methodists. Although Bond Head had sent a letter to Glenelg to discredit Jones, the Minister met with Jones in the spring of 1838. The meeting went very well for Jones, as Glenelg promised to help secure title deeds for the Mississaugas. Glenelg also arranged an audience with <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> for Jones. Jones met with her in September of that year, and presented a petition to Queen Victoria from the chiefs of the Mississauga Ojibwa community asking for title deeds to their lands, to ensure the Credit Mississaugas would never lose the title to their lands. The petition was written in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>, signed by the chiefs in <a href="Ojibwe%20writing%20systems%23Ojibwe%20%26quot%3Bhieroglyphs%26quot%3B">pictograph</a>s and accompanied by <a href="wampum">wampum</a> supplementing the information of the petition. Jones, dressed in his Ojibwa regalia, presented the petition and interpreted it for Victoria, to ensure accurate and favourable reception. Victoria approved her minister's recommendation that the Mississaugas be given title deeds. He returned to Upper Canada shortly thereafter.

In Upper Canada, he returned to a community that had begun to question his leadership. William and <a href="Lawrence%20Herchmer">Lawrence Herchmer</a> led a group within the community that opposed Jones' influence, claiming it was turning the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission into "Brown Englishmen". The brothers, while Christians, objected to the harsh discipline imposed on the young, the use of voting rather than consensus to govern and the loss of Indian lifestyle and culture. By 1840, the settlement was very strained; pressure from white settlers, scarcity of wood and the uncertainty of whether the band had claims to the land they occupied forced the band council to begin considering relocation. 1840 also saw the Methodist church split into two factions, Canadian Methodists and British <a href="Methodist%20Church%20of%20Great%20Britain">Wesleyan</a>s. Various Indian bands aligned with either church, and competition hampered missionary work. Of Jones' friends within the church, only Egerton Ryerson remained in the Canadian conference. With the background of these conflicts in the Credit Settlement, it became increasingly difficult for Jones to travel. Jones influence with the provincial government remained small. Although the Mississaugas of the Credit had been promised title deeds, Jones' meeting with Lieutenant Governor <a href="George%20Arthur">George Arthur</a> failed to produce them. Indian Agent <a href="Samuel%20Jarvis">Samuel Jarvis</a>, appointed in 1837, ignored the Mississaugas, failing to issue them the annual reports on their trust funds and failing to respond to letters. The strain of these community splits, combined with Jones' responsibilities as a father after the birth of his first son, Charles Augustus (Wahweyaakuhmegoo ("Waawiyekamigoo", "The Round World")) in April 1839, prevented Jones from undertaking many <a href="wikt%3Aproselytizing">proselytizing</a> tours. As Eliza had previously had two miscarriages and two stillbirths, the couple took great care in raising Charles.

Jones was assigned to the <a href="Munsee-Delaware%20Nation%20Indian%20Reserve%20No.%201">Muncey Mission</a> in 1841. Located south-west of <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a>, the mission proselytized to Indians of three different tribes; <a href="Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a>, <a href="Munsee-Delaware%20Nation">Munsee Delaware</a>, and <a href="Oneida%20Nation%20of%20the%20Thames">Oneida</a>. Jones had hoped to relocate the Mississaugas of Credit here if they failed to obtain title deeds for New Credit, but this plan was opposed by Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis. At the Muncey Mission, each tribe spoke a different language, which made the work challenging for Jones, as did the large contingent of non-Christian Indians. Here two more children were born to the couple, John Frederick (Wahbegwuna ("Waabigwane", "Have a [White Lily-]Flower")) and <a href="Peter%20Edmund%20Jones">Peter Edmund</a> (Kahkewaquonaby ("Gakiiwegwanebi", "[Sacred] Waving Feathers")). John was named for Peter's brother John and Eliza's brother Frederick, Peter for Peter himself and Eliza's brother Edmund. The work at Muncey Mission was stressful on Jones, and his health began to deteriorate. The 1844 Methodist conference found him in such ill health that he was declared a <a href="wikt%3Asupernumerary">supernumerary</a>. The same year, Jarvis was dismissed as chief superintendent of the Indian Agents. With Jarvis removed from office, Jones was able to secure an audience with lieutenant governor <a href="Charles%20Metcalfe%2C%201st%20Baron%20Metcalfe">Charles Metcalfe</a>. Metcalfe was favourably impressed with Jones; he made available funds to build two schools at the Muncey Mission (a boys' school and a girls' school) and turned over administration of the Credit Mississaugas' finances to their chiefs, making them the first Indian Band in Canada to have control over their trust funds.

Jones travelled to Great Britain in 1845 for a third fundraising tour, giving speeches and sermons. Wherever he travelled, Jones drew huge crowds, but inwardly he was depressed. He felt the crowds were only there to see the exotic Indian Kahkewāquonāby and his native costume, and did not appreciate all the work he had put into becoming a good Christian. Despite his misgivings about the trip, he raised £1000, about two thirds of that total in Scotland, and one third in England. On August 4, 1845 in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> Jones was photographed by <a href="Robert%20Adamson%20%28photographer%29">Robert Adamson</a> and <a href="David%20Octavius%20Hill">David Octavius Hill</a>. These were the first photographs taken of a <a href="North%20American%20Indian">North American Indian</a>.

Jones' health continued to decline, and he travelled to Paris to meet with Dr. <a href="Achille-Louis%20Foville">Achille-Louis Foville</a>. Foville examined Jones, but did not prescribe any medicine, instead suggesting cold water sponge baths. With this advice but no effective treatment, Jones returned to England to complete his fundraising tour. Jones returned to <a href="Canada%20West">Canada West</a> in April 1846.

Returning to the Credit Mission, Jones believed the most pressing issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a <a href="clear%20title">clear title</a> to their land. The settlement had established successful farms, and was almost self-sufficient. It was also developing industry, with a pair of carpenters and a shoemaker. The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers at the mouth of the Credit River, the beginning of <a href="Port%20Credit%2C%20Ontario">Port Credit</a>. Although the settlement was prospering, Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band to move off the Credit Mission to a different location, hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded. As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move, he promised them the title deeds which were Jones' main goal for the band. The <a href="Saugeen%20Ojibwa">Saugeen Ojibwa</a> invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the <a href="Bruce%20Peninsula">Bruce Peninsula</a>, which was the last large piece of unceded land in southern Ontario. The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land, and so the band prepared for a move. They turned the Credit lands over to the province in trust, but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news: The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming. Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission, the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation. The <a href="Six%20Nations%20of%20the%20Grand%20River%20First%20Nation">Six Nations</a>, hearing of the Mississaugas' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract to the Credit Mississaugas, remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations. The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Grand River</a> that was donated by the Six Nations. Founded in 1847, the settlement was named <a href="New%20Credit">New Credit</a>. Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here, petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement. In 1848, the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled, and <a href="William%20Ryerson">William Ryerson</a> established a mission in New Credit.

Through the 1840s, Jones' health had been in decline. By the time the Mississaugas moved to New Credit, Jones was too ill to move to an unbuilt settlement. Having to abandon the Credit Mission, he returned to Munceytown with his family. Jones resigned his position in the Methodist church, but continued to undertake work here and there as his health permitted. By 1850, his doctor had ordered him to completely stop travelling and performing his clerical duties, but Jones ignored his advice. In 1851, Jones moved to a new estate near <a href="Echo%20Place">Echo Place</a>, which he dubbed "Echo Villa". The estate was close to the established town of <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, but also allowed him to be close to New Credit. Although he continued to work, his failing health kept him at home often, and he began pursuing more domestic activities. Taking up woodcarving, he won £15 for his bowl and ladle at the annual provincial exhibition. He began writing for the Aborigines Protection Society, acting as their Canadian correspondent for their publication "The Colonial Intelligencer; or, Aborigines' Friend". In the 1850s, Peter began to devote his time and efforts more to his wife and children. His son Charles attended <a href="Genesee%20College">Genesee College</a> in <a href="Lima%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Lima, New York</a>, then studied law. Jones continued travelling when his health permitted. In 1851, to <a href="Lake%20of%20Two%20Mountains">Lake of Two Mountains</a> in <a href="Canada%20East">Canada East</a>; in 1852, through <a href="Northern%20Ontario">Northern Ontario</a>; in 1853, he travelled to New York City for a missionary meeting; and in 1854, he travelled to <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse, New York</a> for a Methodist convention.

The New Credit settlement met with early difficulties, but soon began to prosper. An early sawmill was destroyed by arson in 1851, but a new one was soon in operation. White squatters were driven off the land by about 1855, although theft of logs remained a problem for several years afterwards.

Jones was struck by illness in December 1855 during a wagon ride home from New Credit to Echo Villa. Unable to shake the illness, Jones died in his home on June 29, 1856. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Brantford. His wife Eliza supervised the publication of his books after his death. "Life and Journals" was published in 1860 and "History of the Ojebway Indians" in 1861.

In 1857, a monument was erected in Jones' honour at New Credit, inscribed "Erected by the Ojibeway and other Indian tribes to their revered and beloved Chief Kahkewaquonaby (the Rev. Peter Jones)."

At the church in New Credit, built in 1852, an inscribed marble tablet reads: 

In Memory of 
KAHKEWAQUONABY, 
(Peter Jones), THE FAITHFUL AND HEROIC OJIBEWAY MISSIONARY AND CHIEF: 
THE GUIDE, ADVISOR, AND BENEFACTOR OF HIS PEOPLE.
Born January 1st, 1802.
Died June 29th, 1856. HIS GOOD WORKS LIVE AFTER HIM, 
AND HIS MEMORY IS EMBALMED IN MANY GRATEFUL HEARTS.
In 1997, Jones was declared a "Person of National Historic Significance" by the <a href="Minister%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> <a href="Andy%20Mitchell%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Andy Mitchell</a>. To honour Jones and to underscore his role in helping the Mississaugas survive contact with the Europeans, a celebration of his recognition was held at New Credit. As well, the <a href="Ontario%20Archaeological%20and%20Historic%20Sites%20Board">Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board</a> erected an historic plaque detailing Jones' life. The location of the plaque is Echo Villa, the estate where Jones lived from 1851 until his death in 1856.

Thalassodromeus

Thalassodromeus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> that lived in what is now Brazil during the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, about 100 million years ago. "Thalassodromeus" had one of the largest known skulls among pterosaurs, around long, with one of the proportionally largest cranial crests of any <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>. Though only the skull is known, the animal is estimated to have had a wing span of . The crest was lightly built and ran from the tip of the upper jaw to beyond the back of the skull, ending in a unique V-shaped notch. The jaws were toothless, and had sharp upper and lower edges. Its skull had large nasoantorbital <a href="fenestrae">fenestrae</a> (opening that combined the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> in front of the eye with the bony nostril), and part of its <a href="palate">palate</a> was concave. The lower jaw was blade-like, and may have turned slightly upwards.

The original skull, discovered in 1983 in the <a href="Araripe%20Basin">Araripe Basin</a> of northeastern Brazil, was collected in several pieces. In 2002, the skull was made the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of Thalassodromeus sethi by <a href="palaeontologists">palaeontologists</a> <a href="Alexander%20Kellner">Alexander Kellner</a> and Diogenes de Almeida Campos. The generic name means "sea runner" (in reference to its supposed mode of feeding), and the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to the <a href="ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> god <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Seth</a> due to its crest being supposedly reminiscent of Seth's crown. Other scholars have pointed out that the crest was instead similar to the crown of <a href="Amun">Amon</a>, and Seth did not wear such a crown. A jaw tip was assigned to "T. sethi" in 2005, moved to the new genus "<a href="Banguela">Banguela</a>" in 2014, and assigned back to "Thalassodromeus" as the <a href="species">species</a> T. oberlii in 2018. Another species ("T. sebesensis") was named in 2015 based on a supposed crest fragment, but this was later shown to be part of a turtle shell. The closest relative of "Thalassodromeus" was "<a href="Tupuxuara">Tupuxuara</a>"; both are grouped in a <a href="clade">clade</a> that has been placed within either <a href="Tapejaridae">Tapejaridae</a> (as the subfamily <a href="Thalassodrominae">Thalassodrominae</a>) or within <a href="Neoazhdarchia">Neoazhdarchia</a> (as the family Thalassodromidae).

Several theories have been suggested to explain the function of "Thalassodromeus"'s crest, including <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> and <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a>, but it likely had more than one function. The crests of thalassodromids appear to have developed late in growth (probably correlated with <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>) and they may have been <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> (differing according to sex). As the genus name implies, "Thalassodromeus" was originally proposed to have fed like a modern <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a> bird, by skimming over the water's surface and dipping its lower jaws to catch prey. This idea was later criticised for lack of evidence; "Thalassodromeus" has since been found to have had strong jaw musculature, and may have been able to kill and eat relatively large prey on the ground. The limb proportions of related species indicate that it may have adapted to fly in inland settings, and would have been efficient at moving on the ground. "Thalassodromeus" is known from the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a>, where it coexisted with many other types of pterosaurs, <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> and other animals.

The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> (and only known skull) of "Thalassodromeus sethi" is one of the largest <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> skulls ever discovered. The entire skull is estimated to have been long; the bones were fused together, indicating adulthood. Based on related pterosaurs, its wing-span was , making "Thalassodromeus" the largest known member of its <a href="clade">clade</a>, <a href="Thalassodromidae">Thalassodromidae</a>. Of similar proportions, its skull was more heavily built than that of its relative "<a href="Tupuxuara">Tupuxuara</a>". Although the <a href="postcranial">postcranial</a> skeleton of "Thalassodromeus" is unknown, relatives had unusually short and blocky neck vertebrae, with well-developed front and hind-limbs that were almost equal in length (excluding the long wing-finger). The hindlimbs were 80 percent that of the forelimb length, a unique ratio among <a href="pterodactyloids">pterodactyloids</a> (short-tailed pterosaurs). As a pterosaur (extinct <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of flying reptiles), "Thalassodromeus" was covered with hair-like <a href="pycnofibres">pycnofibres</a> and had extensive wing membranes (which were extended by the wing finger).

The skull of "T. sethi" had a streamlined profile, especially from the tip of the snout to the front edge of the nasoantorbital <a href="fenestra">fenestra</a> (opening which combined the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> in front of the eye with the bony nostril). The most conspicuous feature of the skull was the large crest, which ran along the upper edge from the tip of the snout and beyond the <a href="occiput">occiput</a> at the back of the skull, almost doubling the length and height of the skull. With the exception of the pterosaur "<a href="Tupandactylus%20imperator">Tupandactylus imperator</a>" (whose crest consisted mainly of soft tissue), "T. sethi" had the proportionally largest cranial crest of any known <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> (75 percent of the skull's side surface). The crest was mainly formed by the <a href="premaxillae">premaxillae</a> (the frontmost snout bones), <a href="frontal%20bones">frontal bones</a>, <a href="parietal%20bones">parietal bones</a>, and part of the supraoccipital bone. The premaxillae formed most of the crest, extending to its back, and contacted the frontoparietal part of the crest by a straight <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> (a distinct feature of this <a href="species">species</a>). The crest varied from in thickness; it thickened at the contact between the premaxillae and the frontoparietal part, and became gradually thinner toward the top and back (except for the lower part behind the occiput, where it had a thick base).
Despite its size, the crest was lightly built and essentially hollow; some areas indicate signs of <a href="skeletal%20pneumatisation">skeletal pneumatisation</a> and a well-developed <a href="trabecular">trabecular</a> system uniting the bones. The crest's surface had a system of channels of varying size and thickness, probably the impressions of extensive blood vessels. A small, opening was present above the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket), piercing the basal part of the crest; such a feature is unknown in other pterosaurs, and does not appear to be due to damage. The margins of the opening are smooth, and the inner border has fenestration connecting it to the inner structure of the crest. The back of the crest ended in a prominent V-shaped notch, a unique feature of this species. Although other parts of the crest have V-shaped breaks, the V shape at the end does not appear to have been due to breakage; the margins of the bone can be seen there, still encased by <a href="Matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a>. The crest probably had a <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> (horny) covering and may have been extended by soft tissue in some areas, but the extent of this is unknown.

The upper jaw of "T. sethi" was primarily composed of premaxillae and <a href="maxillae">maxillae</a>; the suture which formed the border between these bones is not visible. As in all members of its clade, the jaws were <a href="Edentulism">edentulous</a> (toothless). The <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> (snout) was long from the tip of the premaxilla to the joint where the <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a> of the skull connected with the <a href="articular%20bone">articular bone</a> of the lower jaw. The front of the premaxillae had sharp upper and lower edges, unique to this species. As in related genera, the nasoantorbital fenestra was comparatively large; it was long and high, which was 71 percent of the skull length (excluding the crest). The <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>, which separated the orbit from the nasoantorbital fenestra, was vertically elongated and higher than the upper surface of the orbit (in contrast to the condition seen in pterodactyloids with smaller nasoantorbital fenestrae). The orbit was slender and compressed from front to back compared to "Tupuxuara" and <a href="tapejarids">tapejarids</a>, but similar to some of them in being more than half the height of the nasoantorbital fenestra. The orbit was positioned lower than the upper margin of the nasoantorbital fenestra, and therefore very low on the skull. Although the bones bordering the <a href="lower%20temporal%20fenestra">lower temporal fenestra</a> (an opening behind the orbit) were incomplete, it appears to have been elongated and slit-like (as in "Tupuxuara" and "<a href="Tapejara%20%28pterosaur%29">Tapejara</a>").
The <a href="Hard%20palate">palatal</a> area at the tip of "T. sethi"'s snout was a sharp ridge, similar to the keel seen on the upper surface of the <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> where the two halves of the lower jaw connected. Small slit-like <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings) on the lower side edges of the ridge indicate that it had a horny covering in life, similar to "Tupandactylus". The lower edge of the area was somewhat curved, which probably created a small gap when the jaws were closed. Further back, immediately in front of the nasoantorbital fenestra, the palatal ridge became a strong, blunt, convex keel. This convexity fit into the symphyseal shelf at the front end of the lower jaw, and they would have tightly interlocked when the jaws were closed. The palatal ridge ended in a strongly concave area unique to this species. The postpalatine fenestrae (openings behind the palatine bone) were oval and very small, differing from those of related species. The ectopterygoid (bone on the side of the palate) had large, plate-like sides, and was well-developed compared to related species. The supraoccipital bone, which formed the hindmost base of the cranial crest, had muscle scars at its upper end (probably corresponding to the attachment of neck muscles).

Although the lower jaw of "T. sethi" is incomplete, its total length is estimated at — 47 percent of which was occupied by the mandibular symphysis. The tip of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> is missing, but its front surface indicates that it might have been turned slightly upwards as in "T. oberlii" (the possible second species of "Thalassodromeus", or possibly a different <a href="genus">genus</a> — "<a href="Banguela">Banguela</a>" — which is only known from a jaw tip). The symphyseal shelf, the upper surface of the symphysis, extended for and had a flat surface. Seen from above, the side edges of this area were tall and formed a sharp margin. Near the front end of the symphysis, the edges which formed the margins became broader towards the front of the shelf until they met and fused. The upper and lower surfaces of the jaw at the front of the shelf were keeled (the upper keel more robust and starting before the lower), which gave the symphysis a blade-like shape. The lower keel became deeper towards the front of the jaw, giving the impression that the jaw deflected downwards; it was actually straight, except for the (perhaps) upturned tip. The <a href="mandibular%20fossae">mandibular fossae</a> (depressions) at the back of the upper jaw were deeper and broader than usual in pterodactyloids, creating large surfaces for the lower jaw to articulate with. The possible species "T. oberlii" differed from "T. sethi" and other relatives by the upper surface of its mandibular symphysis being slightly shorter than the lower surface, and was further distinguished from "T. sethi" by the upper edge of the symphysis being much sharper than the lower. The two species shared features such as the compression of the symphysis sideways and from top to bottom, the sharp keel at the upper front of the symphysis, and the small groove running along the upper surface of the shelf.

The first known "Thalassodromeus" specimen was collected in 1983 near the town of <a href="Santana%20do%20Cariri">Santana do Cariri</a> in the <a href="Araripe%20Basin">Araripe Basin</a> of northeastern Brazil. Found in outcrops of the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a>, it was collected over a long period of time in several pieces. The specimen (catalogued as DGM 1476-R at the <a href="Museu%20de%20Ci%C3%AAncias%20da%20Terra">Museu de Ciências da Terra</a>) was preserved in a <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodule</a>, and consists of an almost-complete, three-dimensional skull (pterosaur bones are often flattened <a href="compression%20fossils">compression fossils</a>), missing two segments of the bottom of the skull and mandible and the front of the lower jaw. The left <a href="jugal%20region">jugal region</a> and right mandibular ramus (half of the mandible) are pushed slightly inward. The skull was first reported in a 1984 Italian book, and preliminarily described and figured in 1990 by <a href="palaeontologists">palaeontologists</a> <a href="Alexander%20W.%20A.%20Kellner">Alexander W. A. Kellner</a> and Diogenes de Almeida Campos. Although the pieces of skull had been divided between museums in South and North America, they were assembled before 2002.
In 2002, Kellner and Campos described and named the new genus and species "Thalassodromeus sethi", skull DGM 1476-R being the holotype specimen. The generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words θάλασσα ("thálassa", "sea") and δρομεύς ("dromeús", "runner"), meaning "sea runner" in reference to the animal's supposed skim-feeding behaviour. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian">ancient Egyptian</a> god <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Seth</a>. The specimen was not fully prepared at the time of this preliminary description. The original describers chose the name "sethi" because the crest of the pterosaur was supposedly reminiscent of the crown worn by Seth; however, the palaeontologists André Jacques Veldmeijer, Marco Signore, and Hanneke J. M. Meijer pointed out in 2005 that the crown (with its two tall plumes) was typically worn by the god <a href="Amun">Amon</a> (or Amon-Ra) and his manifestations—not by Seth.

In 2006, palaeontologists David M. Martill and <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> suggested that "Thalassodromeus" was a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of the related genus "Tupuxuara", which was named by Kellner and Campos in 1988 based on fossils from the same formation. In the view of Martill and Naish, the differences between these genera (including two species of "Tupuxuara", "T. longicristatus" and "T. leonardii") were due to <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> (changes during growth) and compression of the fossils; "Thalassodromeus" was simply an older, larger, and better-preserved individual. This idea was rejected by Kellner and Campos in 2007, who pointed out these species had differences in features other than their crests. They also noted that one specimen of "Tupuxuara" had a larger skull than "Thalassodromeus" (measured from the tip of the premaxilla to the back of the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>), despite Martill and Naish's contention that the latter was an older individual. Kellner and Campos' view has since been accepted by other researchers, including Martill and Naish.

Veldmeijer and colleagues assigned the front part of a mandible collected from the same formation to "T. sethi" in 2005. They concluded that although the two specimens differed in several details, the differences were not significant enough to base a new species on the mandible, and that the new specimen filled in the gap of Kellner and Campos' "T. sethi" skull reconstruction. Palaeontologists Jaime A. Headden and Herbert B. N. Campos coined the new <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> "Banguela oberlii", based on their reinterpretation of the jaw tip as belonging to a toothless member of the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Dsungaripteridae">Dsungaripteridae</a>, in 2014. The generic name is Portuguese for "toothless" and the specific name honours private collector Urs Oberli, who had donated the specimen to the Naturmuseum <a href="St.%20Gallen">St. Gallen</a> (where it is catalogued as NMSG SAO 25109). Headden and Campos interpreted the tip of "T. sethi" lower jaw as downturned; this and other features distinguished it from "Banguela". In their 2018 re-description of the further-prepared "T. sethi" holotype skull, palaeontologists Rodrigo V. Pêgas, Fabiana R. Costa, and Kellner assigned "B. oberlii" back to "Thalassodromeus" while recognising it as a distinct species, and thereby created the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "T. oberlii". Pêgas and colleagues also rejected the theory that the lower jaw of "T. sethi" was downturned, and reinterpreted the frontmost piece of the lower jaw to have connected directly with the subsequent piece (with no gap).

In 2015 palaeontologists Gerald Grellet Tinner and Vlad A. Codrea named a new species, "T. sebesensis", based on what they interpreted as part of a cranial crest in a <a href="concretion">concretion</a> found near the <a href="Sebe%C8%99%20%28river%29">Sebeș River</a> in Romania. The authors said that this would extend the range in time and space for the genus "Thalassodromeus" considerably, creating a 42-million-year <a href="Ghost%20lineage">gap</a> between the older South American species and the younger European species. Palaeontologist <a href="Gareth%20J.%20Dyke">Gareth J. Dyke</a> and a large team of colleagues immediately rejected the pterosaurian identification of the "T. sebesensis" fossil, instead arguing that it was a misidentified part of a <a href="plastron">plastron</a> (lower shell) of the prehistoric turtle "<a href="Kallokibotion%20bajazidi">Kallokibotion bajazidi</a>" (named in 1923). The idea that the fragment belonged to a turtle had been considered and rejected by Grellet-Tinnera and Codrea in their original description. Grellet-Tinnera and Codrea denied the turtle identity suggested by Dyke and colleagues, noting that those researchers had not directly examined the fossil.

The classification of "Thalassodromeus" and its closest relatives is one of the most contentious issues regarding their group. Kellner and Campos originally assigned "Thalassodromeus" to the family <a href="Tapejaridae">Tapejaridae</a>, based on its large crest and large nasoantorbital fenestra. Within this clade, they found that it differed from the short-faced genus "Tapejara" but shared a keel on the palate with "Tupuxuara". Kellner elaborated on the relationships within Tapejaridae in 2004, and pointed out that "Thalassodromeus" and "Tupuxuara" also shared a crest consisting primarily of bone; the crest had a large component of soft tissue in other members of the group. 
Martill and Naish considered Tapejaridae a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> (unnatural) group in 2006, and found "Tupuxuara" (which included "Thalassodromeus" in their analysis) to be the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the family <a href="Azhdarchidae">Azhdarchidae</a>. This clade ("Tupuxuara" and Azhdarchidae) had been named Neoazhdarchia by palaeontologist David Unwin in 2003, an arrangement Martill and Naish concurred with. According to Martill, features uniting members of Neoazhdarchia included the presence of a <a href="notarium">notarium</a> (fused vertebrae in the shoulder region), the loss of contact between the first and third <a href="metacarpals">metacarpals</a> (bones in the hand), and very long snouts (more than 88% of the skull length). Kellner and Campos defended the validity of Tapejaridae in 2007, dividing it into two clades: Tapejarinae and Thalassodrominae, the latter containing "Thalassodromeus" (the <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a>) and "Tupuxuara". They distinguished thalassodromines by their high nasoantorbital fenestrae and the bony part of their crests beginning at the front of the skull and continuing further back than in other pterosaurs.

The interrelationship of these clades within the larger clade <a href="Azhdarchoidea">Azhdarchoidea</a> remained disputed, and the clade containing "Thalassodromeus" and "Tupuxuara" had received different names from different researchers (Thalassodrominae and Tupuxuaridae). Palaeontologist <a href="Mark%20P.%20Witton">Mark P. Witton</a> attempted to resolve the naming issue in 2009, noting that the name "Tupuxuaridae" (first used in the vernacular form "tupuxuarids" by palaeontologist <a href="L%C3%BC%20Junchang">Lü Junchang</a> and colleagues in 2006) had never been validly established and Thalassodrominae should be the proper name (although it was bestowed a year later). Witton further converted the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> name Thalassodrominae into the family name Thalassodromidae, and considered the clade part of Neoazhdarchia. 

A 2011 analysis by palaeontologist Felipe Pinheiro and colleagues upheld the grouping of the clades Tapejarinae and Thalassodrominae in the family Tapejaridae, joined by the <a href="Chaoyangopterinae">Chaoyangopterinae</a>. A 2014 study by palaeontologist Brian Andres and colleagues instead found thalassodromids to group with dsungaripterids, forming the clade Dsungaripteromorpha within Neoazhdarchia (defined as the most inclusive clade containing "<a href="Dsungaripterus%20weii">Dsungaripterus weii</a>" but not "<a href="Quetzalcoatlus%20northropi">Quetzalcoatlus northropi</a>").

Pêgas and colleagues kept Tapejarinae and Thalassodrominae as part of Tapejaridae in 2018, but acknowledged that the subject was still controversial.

Possible functions for "Thalassodromeus" cranial crest were proposed by Kellner and Campos in 2002. They suggested that the network of blood vessels on its large surface was consistent with use for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>, which had also been suggested for the crests of some <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>. Kellner and Campos thought that the crest was used for cooling (enabling the animal to dissipate excess <a href="metabolic">metabolic</a> heat through convection), while heat transfer was controlled by — and depended on — the network of blood vessels. The ability to control its body temperature would have aided "Thalassodromeus" during intense activity (such as hunting), and they suggested that, when in flight, heat would have been dispelled more effectively if the crest was aligned with the wind, while the head was intentionally moved to the sides. Kellner and Campos posited that the crest could have had additional functions, such as <a href="display%20behavior">display</a>; aided by colour, it could have been used in <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a>, and could also have been a <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> feature (differing according to sex), as has been proposed for "<a href="Pteranodon">Pteranodon</a>".

In 2006, Martill and Naish found that the crests of "Tupuxuara" and its relatives developed by the premaxillary portion of the crests growing backwards over the skull-roof (as indicated by the well-defined suture between the premaxilla and the underlying bones). The hind margin of the premaxillary part of this specimen's crest had only reached above the hind margin of the nasoantorbital fenestra, indicating that it was not an adult at the time of death. This suggests that the development of the crest happened late in the growth of an individual, was probably related to <a href="sexual%20display">sexual display</a>, and the <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> of a given specimen could be assessed by the size and disposition of the crest. The "T. sethi" holotype, with its <a href="hypertrophied">hypertrophied</a> (enlarged) premaxillary crest, would thereby represent an old adult individual (and the mature stage of "Tupuxuara", according to their interpretation). Kellner and Campos found Martill and Naish's discussion of cranial crest development interesting, although they found their proposed model speculative.

Palaeontologists David W. E. Hone, Naish, and Innes C. Cuthill reiterated Martill and Naish's growth hypothesis in 2012; since pterosaurs were probably <a href="precocial">precocial</a> and able to fly shortly after hatching, the role of the crest was only relevant after maturity (when the structure was fully grown). They deemed the thermoregulation hypothesis an unlikely explanation for the blood-vessel channels on the crest, which they found consistent with nourishment for growing tissue (such as the keratin in bird beaks). Hone, Naish, and Cuthill suggested that the wing membranes and <a href="air-sac">air-sac</a> system would have been more effective at controlling heat than a crest, and wind and water could also have helped cool pterosaurs in high-temperature maritime settings. In 2013, Witton agreed that the substantially larger crests of adult thalassodromids indicated that they were more important for behavioural activities than for physiology. He found the idea that the crests were used for thermoregulation problematic, since they did not grow regularly with body size; they grew at a fast pace in near-adults, quicker than what would be predicted for the growth of a thermoregulatory structure. According to Witton, the large, highly vascular wing membranes of pterosaurs would provide the surface area needed for thermoregulation, meaning the crests were not needed for that function. He concluded that the crest's blood-vessel patterns did not differ much from those seen on bones under the beaks of birds, which are used for transporting nutrients to the bone and soft tissues rather than for thermoregulation. Witton noted that although bird beaks lose heat quickly, that is not what they were developed for; the crests of pterosaurs might also have had an effect on thermoregulation, without this being their primary function.
Pêgas and colleagues noted that sexual dimorphism in crest size and shape has been proposed for some pterosaurs; the crest shape seen in the "T. sethi" holotype may correlate with one sex and may have been the result of <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>. They suggested that both sexes could have had similar crests due to mutual sexual selection, but interpretation of exaggerated features was challenging due to the small <a href="sample%20size">sample size</a>; more "T. sethi" specimens would have to be found to evaluate these theories. They did not think that thermoregulation correlated with crest growth relative to body size, since the bills of <a href="toucan">toucan</a>s (the largest of any modern birds) grow drastically out of proportion to body size and function as thermoregulatory structures, as well as facilitating feeding and social behaviour. Pêgas and colleagues found the vascular structure of toucan bills comparable to that in the crest of "T. sethi", concluding that the crest also had multiple functions.

Kellner and Campos originally found the jaws of "Thalassodromeus" similar to those of modern <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s — three bird species in the genus "Rhynchops" — with their sideways-compressed jaws, blade-like beak, and protruding lower jaw (resembling scissors in side view). They argued that "Thalassodromeus" would have fed in a similar way, as implied by the genus name; skimmers skim over the surface of water, dipping their lower jaw to catch fish and crustaceans. Kellner and Campos listed additional skull features of skimmers which are adaptations for skim feeding, including enlarged palatine bones, a feature also shared with "Thalassodromeus". Unlike skimmers and other pterosaurs, the palatine bones of "Thalassodromeus" were concave, which the writers suggested could have helped it momentarily store food. Like skimmers, "Thalassodromeus" also appears to have had powerful neck muscles, large jaw muscles, and an upper jaw tip well-irrigated by blood (features which Kellner and Campos interpreted as adaptations for skimming). They concluded that the scissor-like bill and thin crest almost made other modes of capturing prey — such as swooping down toward water and plunging into it — impossible. Conceding the difficulty of reconstructing "Thalassodromeus"s fishing method, they envisioned it with a less-mobile neck than skimmers; with the crest impeding its head from submersion, it would glide and only flap its wings occasionally. They found that the pterosaur with jaws most similar to those of "Thalassodromeus" was the smaller "<a href="Rhamphorhynchus">Rhamphorhynchus</a>", although they believed that it would have had limited skimming ability.
In 2004, palaeontologist <a href="Sankar%20Chatterjee">Sankar Chatterjee</a> and engineer R. Jack Templin said that smaller pterosaurs may have been able to skim-feed. They doubted that this was possible for larger ones, due to their lesser manoeuvrability and flying capability while resisting water. Chatterjee and Templin noted that skimmers have blunter beaks than pterosaurs like "Thalassodromeus", to direct water from the jaw while skimming. In 2007, <a href="biophysicist">biophysicist</a> Stuart Humphries and colleagues questioned whether any pterosaurs would have commonly fed by skimming and said that such conclusions had been based on anatomical comparisons rather than <a href="Biomechanics">biomechanical</a> data. The drag experienced by bird bills and pterosaur jaws was <a href="hydrodynamically">hydrodynamically</a> and <a href="aerodynamically">aerodynamically</a> tested by creating model bills of the <a href="black%20skimmer">black skimmer</a>, "Thalassodromeus", and the (presumably) non-skimming "Tupuxuara" and towing them along a water-filled trough at varying speeds. The researchers found that skimming was more energy costly for skimmers than previously thought, and skimming would have been impossible for a pterosaur weighing more than due to the metabolic power required. They found that even smaller pterosaurs, like "Rhamphorhynchus", were not adapted for skimming. The <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> rigging of the "Thalassodromeus" model was destroyed during the experiment, due to the high and unstable forces exerted on it while high speed skimming, casting further doubt on this feeding-method. The authors used the jaw tip of "T. oberlii" to model the performance of "Thalassodromeus", since it was assigned to "T. sethi" at the time.

Unwin and Martill suggested in 2007 that thalassodromids may have foraged similarly to <a href="storks">storks</a>, as had been suggested for azhdarchids. Witton said in 2013 that although skim-feeding had been suggested for many pterosaur groups, the idea was criticised in recent years; pterosaurs lacked virtually all adaptations for skim-feeding, making it unlikely that they fed this way. "Thalassodromeus" (unlike skimmers) did not have a particularly wide or robust skull or especially large jaw-muscle attachment sites, and its mandible was comparatively short and tubby. Witton agreed with Unwin and Martill that thalassodromids, with their equal limb proportions and elongated jaws, were suited to roaming terrestrially and feeding opportunistically; their shorter, more-flexible necks indicated a different manner of feeding than azhdarchids, which had longer, stiffer necks. He suggested that thalassodromids may have had more generalised feeding habits, and azhdarchids may have been more restricted; "Thalassodromeus" may have been better at handling relatively large, struggling prey than its relative, "Tupuxuara", which had a lighter-built skull. Witton stressed that more studies of functional morphology would have to be done to illuminate the subject and speculated that "Thalassodromeus" might have been a <a href="raptorial">raptorial</a> predator, using its jaws to subdue prey with strong bites; its concave palate could help it swallow large prey.

Pêgas and Kellner presented a reconstruction of the mandibular muscles of "T. sethi" at a conference in 2015. They found that its well-developed jaw muscles differed from those of the possible dip-feeder <a href="Anhanguera%20%28pterosaur%29">"Anhanguera"</a> and the terrestrially stalking azhdarchids, indicating that "T. sethi" had a strong <a href="bite%20force">bite force</a>. In 2018, Pêgas and colleagues agreed that "Thalassodromeus" blade-like, robust jaws indicated that it could have used them to strike and kill prey, but they thought that biomechanical work was needed to substantiate the idea. They found (unlike Witton) that "Thalassodromeus" had a reinforced jaw joint and robust jaw muscles, but more work was needed to determine its dietary habits. According to Pêgas and colleagues, the articulation between "T. sethi" articular and quadrate bones (where the lower jaw connected with the skull) indicates a maximum gape of 50 degrees — similar to the 52-degree gape inferred for "Quetzalcoatlus".

In a 2002 comment on the original description of "T. sethi", engineer John Michael Williams noted that although Kellner and Campos had mentioned that the large crest might have interfered aerodynamically during flight, they had not elaborated on this point and had compared the pterosaur with a bird one-fifth its size. He suggested that "Thalassodromeus" used its crest to balance its jaws, with the head changing attitude depending on the mode of locomotion. Williams speculated that the crest would be inflatable with blood and presented varying air resistance, which he compared to a handheld fan; this would have helped the animal change the attitude of the head during flight (and during contact with water), keeping it from rotating without powerful neck muscles. The crest would have made long flights possible, rather than interfering; Williams compared it with the <a href="spermaceti">spermaceti</a> in the head of the <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>, stating it is supposedly used to change <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a> through temperature adjustment. Kellner and Campos rejected the idea of an inflatable crest, since its compressed bones would not allow this; they did not find the sperm-whale analogy convincing in relation to flying animals, noting that spermaceti is more likely to be used during aggression or for <a href="sonar">sonar</a>. They agreed that the idea of the crest having an in-flight function was tempting and sideways movement of the head would have helped it change direction, but biomechanical and flight-mechanical studies of the crest would have to be conducted to determine the animal's aerodynamics.

Witton also expressed hope for further analysis of thalassodromid locomotion. He noted that since their limb proportions were similar to those of the better-studied azhdarchids, the shape of their wings and style of flight might have been similar. Thalassodromids might also have been adapted for inland flight; their wings were short and broad (unlike the long, narrow wings of marine soarers), and were more manoeuvrable and less likely to snag on obstacles. Their lower shoulder muscles appear to have been enlarged, which would have helped with powerful (or frequent) wing downstrokes and takeoff ability. Although it may have had to compensate for its large crest during flight, its development late in growth indicates that it did not develop primarily for aerodynamics. Witton suggested that the proportional similarity between the limbs of thalassodromids and azhdarchids also indicates that their terrestrial abilities would have been comparable. Their limbs would have been capable of long strides, and their short, compact feet would have made these mechanics efficient. The enlarged shoulder muscles may have allowed them to accelerate quickly when running, and they may have been as adapted for movement on the ground as has been suggested for azhdarchids; Witton cautioned that more analysis of thalassodromids was needed to determine this.

"Thalassodromeus" is known from the Romualdo Formation, which dates to the <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stage</a> of the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a> (about 110 million years ago). The formation is part of the <a href="Santana%20Group">Santana Group</a> and, at the time "Thalassodromeus" was described, was thought to be a <a href="Stratigraphic%20unit">member</a> of what was then considered the Santana Formation. The Romualdo Formation is a <a href="Lagerst%C3%A4tte">Lagerstätte</a> (a <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> deposit that preserves fossils in excellent condition) consisting of <a href="lagoonal">lagoonal</a> <a href="limestone">limestone</a> concretions embedded in <a href="shales">shales</a>, and overlies the <a href="Crato%20Formation">Crato Formation</a>. It is well known for preserving fossils three-dimensionally in calcareous concretions, including many pterosaur fossils. As well as muscle fibres of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, fish preserving gills, digestive tracts, and hearts have been found there. The formation's tropical climate largely corresponded to today's Brazilian climate. Most of its flora were <a href="Xerophyte">xerophytic</a> (adapted to dry environments). The most widespread plants were <a href="Cycadales">Cycadales</a> and the <a href="conifer">conifer</a> "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

Other pterosaurs from the Romualdo Formation include "Anhanguera", "<a href="Araripedactylus">Araripedactylus</a>", "<a href="Araripesaurus">Araripesaurus</a>", "<a href="Brasileodactylus">Brasileodactylus</a>", "<a href="Cearadactylus">Cearadactylus</a>", "<a href="Coloborhynchus">Coloborhynchus</a>", "<a href="Santanadactylus">Santanadactylus</a>", "Tapejara", "Tupuxuara", "<a href="Barbosania">Barbosania</a>","" "<a href="Maaradactylus">Maaradactylus</a>", "<a href="Tropeognathus">Tropeognathus</a>", and "<a href="Unwindia">Unwindia</a>". Thalassodromines are only known from this formation, and though well-preserved postcranial remains from there have been assigned to the group, they cannot be assigned to genus due to their lack of skulls. Dinosaur fauna includes <a href="Theropoda">theropods</a> like "<a href="Irritator">Irritator</a>", "<a href="Santanaraptor">Santanaraptor</a>," "<a href="Mirischia">Mirischia</a>," and an indeterminate <a href="Unenlagiinae">unenlagiine</a> <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaur</a>. The crocodyliforms "<a href="Araripesuchus">Araripesuchus</a>" and "<a href="Caririsuchus">Caririsuchus</a>", as well as the turtles "<a href="Brasilemys">Brasilemys</a>", "<a href="Cearachelys">Cearachelys</a>," "<a href="Araripemys">Araripemys</a>", "<a href="Euraxemys">Euraxemys</a>", and "<a href="Santanachelys">Santanachelys</a>", are known from the deposits. There were also <a href="clam%20shrimp">clam shrimp</a>s, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, ostracods, and <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>. Well-preserved fish fossils record the presence of <a href="hybodont%20sharks">hybodont sharks</a>, <a href="guitarfish">guitarfish</a>, <a href="gar">gar</a>s, <a href="Amiidae">amiids</a>, <a href="ophiopsids">ophiopsids</a>, <a href="Oshuniidae">oshuniids</a>, <a href="Pycnodontidae">pycnodontids</a>, <a href="Aspidorhynchidae">aspidorhynchids</a>, <a href="Cladocyclidae">cladocyclids</a>, <a href="bonefishes">bonefishes</a>, <a href="Chanidae">chanids</a>, <a href="Mawsoniidae">mawsoniids</a> and some uncertain forms. Pêgas and colleagues noted that pterosaur taxa from the Romualdo Formation had several species: two of "Thalassodromeus", two of "Tupuxuara", and up to six species of "Anhanguera". It is possible that not all species in each <a href="taxon">taxon</a> coexisted in time (as has been proposed for the <a href="pteranodontids">pteranodontids</a> of the <a href="Niobrara%20Formation">Niobrara Formation</a>), but there is not enough <a href="stratigraphic">stratigraphic</a> data for the Romualdo Formation to test this.

Treehouse of Horror

Treehouse of Horror, also known as "The Simpsons" Halloween specials, are a series of <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>-themed episodes of the <a href="List%20of%20animated%20television%20series">animated series</a> "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the <a href="Simpson%20family">Simpson family</a> in some <a href="Horror%20film">horror</a>, <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, or <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> setting. They take place outside the show's normal <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic, being known for their far more violent and much darker nature than an average "Simpsons" episode. The first, entitled "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28The%20Simpsons%20episode%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>", aired on October 25, 1990, as part of the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> and was inspired by <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> horror tales. Since then, there have been 28 other "Treehouse of Horror" episodes, with one airing every year.

Episodes contain <a href="parody">parodies</a> of horror, science fiction and fantasy films, as well as the alien characters <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a>, a special version of the opening sequence, and "scary names" in the credits. The show's staff regard the "Treehouse of Horror" as being particularly difficult to produce, as the scripts often go through many rewrites, and the animators typically have to design new <a href="animated%20character">character</a>s and backgrounds.

Many of the episodes are popular among fans and critics of the show and have inspired a whole offshoot of "Simpsons" merchandise, including action figures, playsets, video games, books, DVDs, comic books and a special version of "<a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>". Several of the episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing. In 1996, 2013, and 2015, "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXIII">Treehouse of Horror XXIII</a>" and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXV">Treehouse of Horror XXV</a>" were respectively nominated for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> in the "<a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20Less%20Than%20One%20Hour%29">Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)</a>" category.

"Treehouse of Horror" episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">Twilight Zone</a>" episodes, or old issues of <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a>. Although they are sometimes connected by "wraparounds", the three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within the episode. The two exceptions are "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>", in which <a href="Groundskeeper%20Willie">Groundskeeper Willie</a> is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments, as well as in <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXVIII">Treehouse of Horror XXVIII</a>, in which <a href="Maggie%20Simpson">Maggie</a> is possessed by the demon Pazuzu in the first segment and is still recovering in the next segment. The episodes are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show, since each character appears to be fine afterwards.

From "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28The%20Simpsons%20episode%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>" to "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIII">Treehouse of Horror XIII</a>", all three segments were written by different writers. In some cases there was a fourth writer who wrote the opening and wraparound segments. For the original "Treehouse of Horror", there were three different directors for the episode. Starting with <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2015%29">season 15's</a> "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIV">Treehouse of Horror XIV</a>", however, only one writer has been credited with writing each "Treehouse of Horror" episode.

On occasion, the episodes will be used to showcase special animation, such as the "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>" segment "Homer", in which a computer-animated Homer is shown in a non-animated setting. At the time (1995), it was groundbreaking, as it was unusual for a television show to use such animation. The segment was executive producer <a href="Bill%20Oakley">Bill Oakley</a>'s idea and included live action directed by <a href="David%20Mirkin">David Mirkin</a>. "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XX">Treehouse of Horror XX</a>" included the segment "There's No Business Like Moe Business", which was the first to be musically-themed.

Every "Treehouse of Horror" episode opens with a special introductory segment. The first, second and fifth "Treehouse of Horror" episodes open with <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> standing on a stage and warning parents about the content of the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281931%20film%29">Frankenstein</a>". Marge's warnings quickly became a burden to write. After "Treehouse of Horror V", they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.

Other "Treehouse of Horror" episodes have opened with parodies; for example, "Treehouse of Horror III" had Homer introduce the episode in a manner similar to <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> in "<a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>", "Treehouse of Horror IV" had Bart introduce the episode and segments in a manner similar to "<a href="Night%20Gallery">Night Gallery</a>", and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>" featured a parody of "<a href="The%20Outer%20Limits%20%281995%20TV%20series%29">The Outer Limits</a>". The <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">sixth</a> and <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VII">seventh</a> episodes featured short clips with no lines because the episodes had run long and longer segments were cut. Following "Treehouse of Horror VII", the opening has been upwards of a minute long and sometimes featured an introduction by a character, such as <a href="Montgomery%20Burns">Mr. Burns</a> in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XVII">Treehouse of Horror XVII</a>" or included over-the-top violence, such as "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VIII">Treehouse of Horror VIII</a>" (which showed a <a href="Fox%20Network">Fox Network</a> censor being brutally murdered) and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIV">Treehouse of Horror XIV</a>" (which showed the Simpson family killing each other).

In the opening segment of the first five episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous season, deceased celebrities such as <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> and <a href="Jim%20Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> and a tombstone with an inscription that read "TV violence" that was riddled with bullets as the camera panned on it. They were last used in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>", which included a solitary tombstone with the words "Amusing Tombstones" to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Another reason they were dropped was that the tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled the previous season; after a few years, several of the shows that were canceled were produced by former "Simpsons" writers. However after two decades, this gag made a brief comeback in <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXIX">Treehouse of Horror XXIX</a> at the very beginning, this time appearing before the main opening sequence and title. 

While the early "Treehouse of Horror" episodes featured a Halloween themed opening sequence, the later ones only included the title and the "created by" and "developed by" credits. Every episode between "Treehouse of Horror II" and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20X">Treehouse of Horror X</a>" featured a <a href="The%20Simpsons%20opening%20sequence%23Couch%20gag">couch gag</a> with a Halloween theme, including the Simpson family dressed as skeletons, zombies and characters from previous Halloween episodes.

The first four "Treehouse of Horror" episodes had brief <a href="interstitial%20program">wraparounds</a> that occurred before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories. "Treehouse of Horror" was the only one that actually included a treehouse as a setting. In that episode, Bart and Lisa sat in it telling stories to each other. "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20II">Treehouse of Horror II</a>" presented all of the segments as being nightmares of Lisa, Bart and Homer; "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20III">Treehouse of Horror III</a>" had Lisa, Bart and <a href="Abraham%20Simpson">Grampa</a> telling stories at a Halloween party; and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV">Treehouse of Horror IV</a>" is presented by Bart in a parody of <a href="Rod%20Serling">Rod Serling's</a> "<a href="Night%20Gallery">Night Gallery</a>". After a few years, the amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened, allowing less time to tell a proper story. There were no wraparounds for "Treehouse of Horror V" because they had been cut to make more time for the segments. Following that, the writers permanently dropped them.

Two characters that are virtually exclusive to the "Treehouse of Horror" series are <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a>, a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in the "Hungry are the Damned" segment of "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28The%20Simpsons%20episode%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>". Kang and Kodos have since appeared in every "Treehouse of Horror" episode, sometimes as important parts of a story, but often just for brief cameos. In some episodes, they only appear in the opening segment, but often they will make a cameo appearance in the middle of a different story. For example, a story about zombies attacking the town briefly cuts to them in their space ship, watching the events and laughing maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering. The action then switches back to the actual story. The unofficial rule is that they must be in every episode, although quite often they will be forgotten and are added at the last moment, resulting in only a brief appearance. Their scene in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VIII">Treehouse of Horror VIII</a>" nearly did not make the final cut of the episode, but <a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David X. Cohen</a> managed to persuade the producers to leave the scene in.

Kang and Kodos were prominent characters in the 2015 episode "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Came%20to%20Be%20Dinner">The Man Who Came to Be Dinner</a>," which was not Halloween themed.

Beginning with "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20II">Treehouse of Horror II</a>", the producers decided to give the cast and crew of the show "scary names" in the opening and closing credits. Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there have been a wide variety of special credits, from simple names like "<a href="Matt%20Groening">Bat Groening</a>" to complex ones like "<a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David²+S.²=Cohen²</a>". <a href="Sam%20Simon">Sam Simon</a>, who left the show during the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> but still receives "developed by" and "executive producer" credits, has ever since been listed in "Treehouse of Horror" episodes as "Sam 'Sayonara' Simon". Since his death in 2015 he has been credited simply by his real name.

The idea for "scary names" came from executive producer <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a>, who was inspired by <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> because some of the issues also used "scary" alternate names. The "scary names" became such a burden to write that they were cut for "Treehouse of Horror XII" and "Treehouse of Horror XIII", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back. <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>'s rule for the "scary names" is that they cannot be longer than a person's real name, but this is rarely followed by anyone else.

References to films, novels, plays, television shows and other media are commonly featured, and many segments have been parodies of a specific work in the horror, science fiction or fantasy genre. Many segments are spoofs of episodes of "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">The Twilight Zone</a>" and entire segments will be based on a single episode. Some of the "Twilight Zone" episodes parodied include "<a href="A%20Kind%20of%20a%20Stopwatch">A Kind of a Stopwatch</a>", "<a href="To%20Serve%20Man%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">To Serve Man</a>", "<a href="A%20Small%20Talent%20for%20War">A Small Talent for War</a>", "<a href="Living%20Doll%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">Living Doll</a>", "<a href="Nightmare%20at%2020%2C000%20Feet">Nightmare at 20,000 Feet</a>", "<a href="Little%20Girl%20Lost%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">Little Girl Lost</a>", and "<a href="The%20Little%20People">The Little People</a>". The "Bart's Nightmare" segment of "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20II">Treehouse of Horror II</a>" parodies the episode "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Good%20Life%20%28The%20Twilight%20Zone%29">It's a Good Life</a>" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of "The Twilight Zone". The Halloween episodes also regularly parody horror and thriller films such as "<a href="The%20Exorcist%20%28film%29">The Exorcist</a>", "<a href="The%20Amityville%20Horror%20%281979%20film%29">The Amityville Horror</a>", "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>", "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead">Night of the Living Dead</a>", "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>", "<a href="A%20Nightmare%20on%20Elm%20Street">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>", "<a href="The%20Fly%20%281958%20film%29">The Fly</a>", "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>", "<a href="Paranormal%20Activity">Paranormal Activity</a>", and "<a href="Dead%20Calm%20%28film%29">Dead Calm</a>". <a href="Robert%20Englund">Robert Englund</a>, who portrays <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a> in the "<a href="A%20Nightmare%20on%20Elm%20Street%20%28franchise%29">Nightmare on Elm street</a>" franchise, had a cameo appearance in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IX">Treehouse of Horror IX</a>" as the character. Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror. Science fiction works parodied include "<a href="The%20Omega%20Man">The Omega Man</a>", the novel "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>", "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>" and <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>'s "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds%20%28radio%20drama%29">The War of the Worlds</a>" radio broadcast. In "Treehouse of Horror", <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>" is read by <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a> while the parts are acted by various characters. Recent parodies have included films and television specials in more varied genres, including "<a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Smith%20%282005%20film%29">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>", "<a href="It%27s%20the%20Great%20Pumpkin%2C%20Charlie%20Brown">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a>", "<a href="Transformers%20%28film%29">Transformers</a>", "<a href="Sweeney%20Todd">Sweeney Todd</a>", the <a href="The%20Twilight%20Saga%20%28film%20series%29">"Twilight" film series</a>, and "<a href="Jumanji">Jumanji</a>".

A modified version of the <a href="production%20logo">production logo</a> for <a href="Gracie%20Films">Gracie Films</a> is displayed after the closing credits. The shushing sound is replaced by a scream, and the jingle is played in a minor key on a pipe organ.

The first "Treehouse of Horror" episode aired in 1990 as part of <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">the second season</a>, and its on-screen title was "The Simpsons Halloween Special." It was inspired by <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> Horror tales. Although every episode is entitled "Treehouse of Horror", the first one was the only episode that actually used the treehouse motif. During production of the first episode, <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> was nervous about "The Raven" segment, and felt it would be "the worst, most pretentious thing [they had] ever done."

The "Treehouse of Horror" episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators. The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers, giving the animators more time to work. Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs. They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20–22 minute episode. The episodes often go through many last minute changes, with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded. "Treehouse of Horror III" in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six-week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode. By the fourth season, executive producers <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a> and <a href="Mike%20Reiss">Mike Reiss</a> were less enamored of "Treehouse of Horror" episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.

Part of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but can be used as a segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer <a href="David%20Mirkin">David Mirkin</a> among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. "Treehouse of Horror V" has been described by Mirkin as being one of "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier "Treehouse of Horror" episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it "a societal thing". He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like "<a href="Coraline%20%28film%29">Coraline</a>", and that, "[in] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower."

Although gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as "Citizen Kang" in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VII">Treehouse of Horror VII</a>", satirize political issues. The opening segment of "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIX">Treehouse of Horror XIX</a>" featured Homer attempting to vote for <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>. Rather than taking sides in the election, Al Jean says it is "mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system."[sic]"" In "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XVII">Treehouse of Horror XVII</a>", a segment called "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say "This sure is a lot like Iraq will be." The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the "review" version sent to newspapers and magazines.

The first "Treehouse of Horror" episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a <a href="theremin">theremin</a>, but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes. Usually when the producers submit an episode for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for "<a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Music%20Composition%20for%20a%20Series">Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)</a>", they submit a Treehouse of Horror episode, and to date, seven episodes have been nominated. The closing of "Treehouse of Horror IV" features a version of the theme that is a combination of the instruments used in "<a href="The%20Munsters">The Munsters</a>" theme song and the harpiscord and clicking from the "<a href="The%20Addams%20Family%20%281964%20TV%20series%29">Addams Family</a>" theme song.

Üter Zörker is so far the only human character introduced in a Treehouse of Horror episode to make it into the canon. His debut episode was "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV">Treehouse of Horror IV</a>" in the segment "Terror at Feet". He is an obese German exchange student obsessed with candy and is voiced by Russi Taylor.

Executive producer Al Jean revealed that 2019's "Treehouse of Horror" will be the 666th episode of "The Simpsons "series. Jean stated that this was planned ever since the show began airing in 1989.

Although "Treehouse of Horror" episodes are Halloween-themed, for several years new episodes premiered in November following the holiday, due to <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>'s coverage of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>. <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2012%29">Season 12</a>'s "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XI">Treehouse of Horror XI</a>" was the first episode to air in November. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIV">Treehouse of Horror XIV</a>" where Kang looks at a "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" and says, "Pathetic humans. They're showing a Halloween episode... in November!" and Kodos replies "Who's still thinking about Halloween? We've already got our Christmas decoration up." The camera then cuts to a shot of the fireplace with Christmas decorations, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits. <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2021%29">Season 21</a>'s "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XX">Treehouse of Horror XX</a>" aired October 18, before the World Series, but the following year's episode, "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXI">Treehouse of Horror XXI</a>", aired in November. <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2023%29">Season 23</a>'s "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXII">Treehouse of Horror XXII</a> aired on October 30, however, as the World Series (which went the maximum of <a href="2011%20World%20Series">seven games</a>) had concluded on October 28. Subsequent "Treehouse of Horror" episodes have premiered in the month of October.

There has been a variety of merchandise based on the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes, including books, action figures, <a href="Bart%20Simpson%27s%20Treehouse%20of%20Horror">comic books</a>, video games, DVDs and a "Treehouse of Horror" version of <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a>'s board game <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>. Although every "Treehouse of Horror" episode until "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XVI">Treehouse of Horror XVI</a>" has been released along with its season in a <a href="The%20Simpsons%20DVD%20boxsets">boxset</a>, in 2003, "The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror DVD" was released. It includes "Treehouse of Horror"s V, VI, VII and XII. A "Treehouse of Horror" comic book has been published annually since 1995, and collected into <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20books">several books</a>, including "The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Fun-Filled Frightfest", "Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror Spine-Tingling Spooktacular", "Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror Heebie-Jeebie Hullabaloo" and "The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Hoodoo Voodoo Brouhaha". Several <a href="The%20Simpsons%20video%20games">video games based on "The Simpsons"</a> include levels with a Halloween theme, including "" and "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Game">The Simpsons Game</a>". In 2001, <a href="Fox%20Interactive">Fox Interactive</a> and <a href="THQ">THQ</a> released "" on <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>. The entire game has a Halloween theme as the player tries to save the Simpson family from the Treehouse of Horror.

Many of the special character designs featured in the episodes have become action figures. Four different playsets have been made by <a href="Playmates%20Toys">Playmates Toys</a> and released as <a href="Toys%20%26quot%3BR%26quot%3B%20Us">Toys "R" Us</a> exclusives. The sets are:

After the <a href="Playmates%20Toys">Playmates Toys</a> sets were finished, <a href="McFarlane%20Toys">McFarlane Toys</a> produced four "Treehouse of Horror" themed playsets including the "Ironic Punishment Box Set" released in 2004, the "In the Belly of the Boss — Homer & Marge Action Figures" released in 2005, "The Island of Dr. Hibbert Box Set" released in 2006, and a "Lard Lad Box Set" released in 2007.

The "Treehouse of Horror" episodes are often among the top-rated episodes of their seasons and many of the "Treehouse of Horror"s have generally been well-received by fans. However, like "The Simpsons" itself, critics have noted a decline in the quality of the later episodes. In its first airing, "Treehouse of Horror" finished with a 15.7 Nielsen rating and a 25% audience share and would lose to "<a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">The Cosby Show</a>". It was said that it "set a level of excellence that viewers never expected creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> to repeat", although it was also described as "kind of stupid and unsatisfying". "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>" is considered the best episode by several critics: it finished ninth on "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"'s top 25 "The Simpsons" episode list, fifth on AskMen.com's "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" list, and was named best episode of the sixth season by <a href="IGN.com">IGN.com</a>. In 2006, <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, who guest starred in "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28The%20Simpsons%20episode%29">Treehouse of Horror</a>" and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>" was named seventh on IGN's "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances" list.

In 2006, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>.com published a list of the top ten "Treehouse of Horror" segments, and they placed "The Shinning" from "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Treehouse of Horror V</a>" at the top, saying it was "not only a standout installment of the annual Halloween episode, but of "The Simpsons", period." Rounding out the list were "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20III">Dial "Z" for Zombies</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV">The Devil and Homer Simpson</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">Time and Punishment</a>", "Hungry Are the Damned", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20III">Clown Without Pity</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VII">Citizen Kang</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20II">If I Only Had a Brain</a>", "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV">Bart Simpson's Dracula</a>" and "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IX">Starship Poopers</a>". The third, fourth and fifth episodes were each represented by two segments. The most recent episode on the list was "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IX">Treehouse of Horror IX</a>", which first aired in 1998.

"<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VII">Treehouse of Horror VII</a>" is "Simpsons" creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>'s seventh favorite episode, and the line he likes best is "We have reached the limit of what rectal probing can teach us." "King Homer" of "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20III">Treehouse of Horror III</a>" is one of Matt Groening's favorite segments. "Treehouse of Horror III" is also noted for the moment where Homer shoots <a href="Ned%20Flanders">Ned Flanders</a> and Bart says "Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!" only for Homer to reply, "He was a zombie?" It is also one of Groening's favorite lines.

In 1996, the "Homer³" segment of "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>" was awarded the <a href="Ottawa%20International%20Animation%20Festival">Ottawa International Animation Festival</a> grand prize. In 1998, "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VIII">Treehouse of Horror VIII</a>" won a <a href="Golden%20Reel%20Award">Golden Reel Award</a> for "Best Sound Editing – Television Animated Specials"; the recipients were Robert Mackston, <a href="Travis%20Powers">Travis Powers</a>, Norm MacLeod and Terry Greene. Bob Beecher also received a nomination for "Best Sound Editing in Television Animation – Music" for "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20X">Treehouse of Horror X</a>".

The <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20II">second</a>, <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20III">third</a>, <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20V">fifth</a>, <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VIII">eighth</a>, <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IX">ninth</a>, <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XIV">fourteenth</a> and <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XV">fifteenth</a> and <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XVIII">eighteenth</a> "Treehouse of Horror" episodes were nominated for "<a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Music%20Composition%20for%20a%20Series">Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)</a>" at the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Primetime Emmy Awards</a>. The second and third "Treehouse of Horror" episodes were also nominated for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special". In 1996, "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>" was submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award in the "<a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28For%20Programming%20less%20than%20One%20Hour%29">Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)</a>" category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which the staff felt would have given it the edge. The episode failed to win and <a href="Bill%20Oakley">Bill Oakley</a> later expressed regret about submitting the episode. The <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXIII">twenty-third</a> and <a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20XXV">twenty-fifth</a> "Treehouse of Horror" episodes were nominated for the same award in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

Russian battleship Rostislav

Rostislav was a <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> built by the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Shipyard">Nikolaev Admiralty Shipyard</a> in the 1890s for the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>. She was conceived as a small, inexpensive <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a>, but the Navy abandoned the concept in favor of a compact, seagoing battleship with a displacement of . Poor design and construction practices increased her actual displacement by more than . "Rostislav" became the world's first <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> to burn <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, rather than coal. Her combat ability was compromised by the use of main guns instead of the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> Russian standard of .

Her hull was launched in September 1896, but non-delivery of the ship's main guns delayed her <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a> until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 "Rostislav" became the first ship of the Imperial Navy to be commanded by a member of the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">House of Romanov</a>, Captain <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexander%20Mikhailovich%20of%20Russia">Alexander Mikhailovich</a>. From 1903 to 1912 the ship was the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="second-in-command">second-in-command</a> of the Black Sea Fleet. During the <a href="1905%20Russian%20Revolution">1905 Russian Revolution</a> her crew was on the verge of mutiny, but ultimately remained loyal to the regime, and actively suppressed the <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> of the cruiser "Ochakov".

"Rostislav" was actively engaged in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> until the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I, the first to be hit by a German <a href="airstrike">airstrike</a>, and the first to destroy a submarine, albeit <a href="Karp-class%20submarine">a Russian one</a>. In April 1918 the fleeing <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s abandoned "Rostislav" in <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>. A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The <a href="White%20movement">White forces</a> used the ship as a towed <a href="floating%20battery">floating battery</a>, then scuttled her in the <a href="Kerch%20Strait">Kerch Strait</a> in November 1920.

Similar in size to earlier <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a>s but <a href="seaworthy">seaworthy</a> for operations in the Black Sea, "Rostislav" was conceived in 1892 as a cheap and compact platform for 12-inch guns. Admiral <a href="Nikolay%20Chikhachov">Nikolay Chikhachov</a>, Chief of the Ministry of the Navy, envisioned a squadron of such ships, each displacing , that would fit into his total desired displacement target of . Chief designer of the Nikolaev Shipyard, Sergey Ratnik, evaluated Chikhachov's request for proposals, and advised against the idea in general. The Naval Technical Committee (NTC) concurred: any meaningful combination of firepower, armor, speed and stability required at least . The NTC discarded Ratnik's advice to build an improved copy of the battleship of , but did not present a definite alternative. The NTC declined to discuss tactical matters, leaving the choice of armament to Chikhachov.

Chikhachov instructed Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard to draft two proposals, one armed with 10-inch and the other with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy <a href="Official">brass</a> spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when <a href="General%20Admiral">General Admiral</a> <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexey</a> resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber.

"Rostislav" had the same hull as "Sissoi Veliky", protected with the newly developed <a href="Harvey%20armor">Harvey armor</a>. She was also the first Russian battleship to use electric power instead of older hydraulic systems to <a href="wikt%3Atrain">train</a> her guns.

"Rostislav" was <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a> and long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. She had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . She displaced , over more than her designed displacement of . This weight gain increased her draft by about , submerging most, if not all, of her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> armored belt.

"Rostislav" had two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, identical to those of "Sissoi Veliky", that had a total designed output of . Eight cylindrical <a href="fire-tube%20boiler">fire-tube boiler</a>s provided steam to the engines, each of which drove one <a href="propeller">propeller</a>. Half of the <a href="fire-tube%20boiler">fire-tube boiler</a>s were coal-fired and the other half were oil-fired, making "Rostislav" the first <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> in the world to use <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>. This was done in order to substitute cheap oil from <a href="Baku">Baku</a> for expensive imported coal. On <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, the power plant produced a total of and a top speed of . She carried a maximum of of fuel oil and coal at full load that provided a range of at a speed of .

The main armament consisted of two pairs of <a href="254mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201891"></a> 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> Model 1891 guns mounted in French-style, center-pivot twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s fore and aft. Each turret had an arc of fire of 240°. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and could depress to −5°. They fired a shell at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . At an elevation of +6° the guns had a range . All eight of the 45-caliber, <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> Pattern 1891 guns were mounted in twin-gun turrets on the main deck. Each turret was positioned at a corner of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and had an arc of fire of 110°. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a maximum range of when fired at an elevation of +20°.

The anti-<a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> armament consisted of twelve <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s. Eight of these were mounted in the superstructure and the locations of the remaining four are unclear. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The ship also mounted sixteen Hotchkiss guns, eight of which were carried in the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">fighting top</a>. The locations of the other eight are unknown. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

"Rostislav" carried six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. The bow and stern tubes and the aft pair of <a href="broadside">broadside</a> tubes were above water. The forward broadside tubes were underwater. The ship carried 50 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be used to protect her anchorage.

The maximum thickness of the "Rostislav"s <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> was , tapering to abreast the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s. It covered of the ship's length and was high. While the exact height of the belt above the designed waterline is unknown, much of it, if not all, would have been below the waterline as the ship's draft was over deeper than designed. The belt terminated forward in a transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> and aft in a bulkhead. The upper belt was 5 inches thick, high and covered of the ship's side. The sides of the main gun turrets were 10 inches thick and they had roofs. The sides of the 6-inch turrets were 6 inches thick as were the sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>. The armor <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was flat and located at the upper edge of the main belt. It was thick. Below the waterline, forward and aft of the <a href="armored%20citadel">armored citadel</a>, were decks.

Work on "Rostislav" commenced on January 30, 1894. The ship was officially christened May 20, 1894; in line with Russian tradition, the formal laying down ceremony was delayed until May 19, 1895. The contract for oil-firing <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a>s and engines was awarded to <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Works</a>. The armor was rolled in the United States by <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> within the framework of an earlier contract for s. Bethlehem Steel faced the scrutiny of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Committee on Naval Affairs</a> for charging the Russians an unusually low "introductory" price of $250 to $300 per ton, compared to $600 to $660 paid by the United States Navy. Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Tillman">Benjamin Tillman</a> publicly accused Bethlehem and <a href="Carnegie%20Steel%20Company">Carnegie</a> of <a href="price%20fixing">price fixing</a> and robbing the American taxpayer.

"Rostislav"s hull was launched on September 2, 1896. Lack of proper cranes in <a href="Mykolaiv">Nikolaev</a> made the installation of its engines exceedingly difficult, to the point that the navy even considered towing the hull to <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> for completion. The Nikolaev engineers eventually resolved the problem and the ship was ready to sail in July 1897. "Rostislav" conducted her speed trials on October 21, 1898, still missing her main guns. Her power plant performed flawlessly, but its weight exceeded the design target by more than .

Non-delivery of the new 10-inch Model 1897 guns, made by the <a href="Obukhov%20State%20Plant">Obukhov Factory</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> for "Rostislav", s and s, delayed the completion of the ship by two years. One of these guns, earmarked for "Admiral Ushakov", exploded at the proving ground and the whole batch was subjected to exhaustive tests and, when possible, repairs. Guns Number 16 through Number 19 passed the tests and were delivered to Sevastopol in July and August 1899. "Rostislav" was able to sail to her first gunnery trial on April 12, 1900. On the second day of shooting practice the <a href="shock%20absorber">recoil mechanism</a>s of her forward turret failed and more defects were discovered back at the base. "Rostislav" spent the rest of the spring having her gun mounts repaired, but the problem persisted and the Navy "solved" it by prohibiting them from being used. The gun mounts were rebuilt along the pattern of those used by the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> in 1901 and 1902, and "Rostislav" successfully passed the gunnery tests in June 1902. The ship's electrical turret controls, with their 332 <a href="Electrical%20connector">contact pairs</a>, required tedious maintenance and proved too complex for most of the enlisted men.

On May 1, 1899, <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexander%20Mikhailovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich</a> assumed command of "Rostislav", becoming the first <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">Romanov</a> since <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter I</a> to command a combat ship. Another Romanov, <a href="Cyril%20Vladimirovich%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Kirill</a>, spent a few uneventful months on board "Rostislav" in 1900. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> regularly interfered with the crew's duties, but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship's equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated "Rostislav" as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with "Sissoi Veliky", persuaded the NTC to reinforce "Rostislav"s rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> and returned to his ship as a squadron commander. "Rostislav" served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.

The 1900 season revealed grave problems with "Rostislav"s boilers. Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of <a href="Firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">fireboxes</a> and sudden <a href="backdraft">backdraft</a>s. For three and a half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild-controlled</a> Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>.
Repairs and alterations of the power plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and convert "Rostislav" to coal in 1904 and 1905. Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overweight ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below the waterline.

The Tsentralka, the group plotting a mutiny of the Black Sea Fleet, decided on June 25, 1905, that the mutiny should start on "Potemkin" rather than "Rostislav". On June 27, 1905, the day of the <a href="Russian%20battleship%20Potemkin">battleship "Potemkin" mutiny</a>, "Rostislav" was sailing under the ensign of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Alexander%20Krieger">Alexander Krieger</a>. <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a> ordered Krieger and his superior, fleet commander <a href="Grigory%20Chukhnin">Grigory Chukhnin</a>, to destroy the rebels by force, but the admirals refrained from shooting. They let the rebels flee to <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> and later to <a href="Romania">Romania</a>. Krieger's own crew was on the verge of open mutiny. On July 2, 1905, a military council held on board "Rostislav" decided to moor the ships in Odessa, disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will. By the time of the <a href="Ochakov%20mutiny">"Ochakov" mutiny</a> in November 1905, fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10-inch and fourteen 6-inch shells against the rebels.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> the Imperial Navy concentrated on improving their gunnery skills and fire-control practices. In 1908 <a href="Alexei%20Krylov">Alexei Krylov</a> and <a href="Yevgeny%20Berkalov">Yevgeny Berkalov</a> led "Rostislav" on an unprecedented long-range gunnery shoot: "Rostislav" fired 330 ten-inch shells at a distance of in a few days. The experiment proved that the older <a href="Range%20of%20a%20projectile">ballistic tables</a> used by the Navy were inaccurate. Berkalov compiled the data from the 1908 exercise into the new tables adopted by the Navy. Another of Krylov's initiatives, rapid <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23C">counter-flooding</a>, was standardized in 1909.

Two plans for modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the <a href="Naval%20General%20Staff">Naval General Staff</a> proposed a major reconstruction aimed at reducing her draft and raising her armor belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, <a href="torpedo%20net">torpedo net</a>s, auxiliary boilers and 47-millimeter guns would have been removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast. These changes would have reduced her displacement by , but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money. Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about this time. In 1912 the staff of the Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47 mm guns with four guns and to remove the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not think that this was worth the cost and rejected the plan. Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to "Rostislav" before the war. A dozen of her 37 mm guns were removed in 1906, and she was fitted with <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s, probably made by <a href="Barr%20and%20Stroud">Barr and Stroud</a>, in 1907 and 1908.

In 1909 and 1910, "Rostislav" and the rest of the Black Sea Fleet prepared for joint operations with <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. She was scheduled for an installation of the first Russian <a href="underwater%20acoustic%20communication">underwater acoustic communication</a> system, but the installation was interrupted and her hardware was installed on the battleship (the former "Potemkin") instead. During an anti-submarine exercise on the night of June 11, 1909, "Rostislav" accidentally rammed and sank the submarine <a href="Karp-class%20submarine">"Kambala"</a>. Twenty men of "Kambala" and two rescue divers died. The accident was blamed on reckless maneuvering by the submarine, and "Rostislav"s captain was cleared of any negligence or wrongdoing.

Before the outbreak of World War I "Rostislav" was involved in two minor international incidents. On August 11, 1911, and "Panteleimon", two of the Black Sea Fleet battleships paying a state visit to Romania, ran aground on a <a href="shoal">shoal</a> just off the port of <a href="Constan%C8%9Ba">Constanța</a>. "Rostislav"s officers had detected the hazard and steered her to safety, but did not alert the other ships. The international embarrassment that followed led to the resignation of fleet commander Admiral <a href="Ivan%20Bostrem">Ivan Bostrem</a>. During the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a> "Rostislav" sailed into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> to protect the Russian Embassy in Istanbul from a mob. "Rostislav" accidentally fired a live shell into the Turkish defenses. No one was injured during the incident, and the captain defused the situation with a personal apology to the Ottoman government.

"Rostislav" spent the winter of 1913–14 refitting, and in April 1914 she returned to the active fleet with newly overhauled machinery, new rangefinders and new gun sights. The ship made on her post-refit trials.

On November 4, 1914, the Black Sea Fleet sailed out on its first combat operation of the war: the bombardment of <a href="Zonguldak">Zonguldak</a>. The operation was conceived as a retaliation against the <a href="SMS%20Goeben%231914">Turkish-German attack on Sevastopol</a>. "Rostislav", captained by <a href="Kazimierz%20Por%C4%99bski">Kazimierz Porębski</a>, was the "designated <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>" while other Russian battleships formed a defensive screen around her. On November 6 she fired 251 shells at the port of Zonguldak, reducing it to rubble. On November 18 the ship faced "Goeben" during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Sarych">Battle of Cape Sarych</a>, but the German ship broke contact before "Rostislav", trailing behind the Russian formation, even spotted her. "Rostislav" had other encounters with "Goeben" in 1915 and 1916, but did not engage her directly. In 1915 the ship received four 75 mm <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns.

After the commissioning of the dreadnoughts, the old battleships were split into independent combat groups. "Rostislav" became the flagship of the <a href="Batumi">Batumi</a> Group tasked with supporting the ground operations of the <a href="Russian%20Caucasus%20Army%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Caucasus Army</a>. Their first joint action began February 5, 1916, near <a href="Arhavi">Arhavi</a>. On the first day alone the ship fired 400 shells against the Turks. On March 4 "Rostislav" and the gunboats "Kubanetz" and "Donetz" supported the amphibious landing at <a href="Pazar%2C%20Rize">Atina</a>. Three days later she supported the landing of marines that ended in the capture of <a href="Rize">Rize</a>. At the end of March "Rostislav" and "Panteleimon" forced the Turks to evacuate <a href="Trabzon">Trabzon</a>.

In the summer of 1916 the Navy seriously considered an all-out amphibious assault on the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>. Fleet commander <a href="Andrei%20Eberhardt">Andrei Eberhardt</a> anticipated a high risk of naval mine and torpedo hits in the coastal waters and suggested equipping all pre-dreadnought battleships with <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s. had her bulges fitted in Nikolaev in July 1916, and "Rostislav" was next in line, but the work was cancelled in August, and she was transferred to the Romanian coast as flagship of the Constanța Group. Constanța temporarily became an important logistical hub for the Russian troops heading to the Romanian Front, and the base for minelayers, submarines and destroyers harassing the enemy in the Bosphorus area. The Germans responded with air raids; their first aerial success against a Russian naval target was scored against "Rostislav". The bomb hit the edge of the aft 10-inch turret and injured sixteen sailors. The turret itself remained fully operational. The <a href="Romania%20during%20World%20War%20I%23The%20counteroffensive%20of%20the%20Central%20Powers%20.28September%E2%80%93December%201916.29">collapse of the Romanian Front</a> in October 1916 forced the Navy to evacuate Constanța. "Rostislav" returned to Sevastopol for a much-needed overhaul.

The <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> of 1917 did not demoralize the Black Sea Fleet as quickly as the Baltic Fleet. Captain Fyodor Stark, a former destroyer commander, maintained "Rostislav" in combat-ready condition until the end of the year. The battleship sailed out for her last voyage to Batumi in September and October. Stark managed to contain the radical politics, <a href="anti-German%20sentiment">anti-German sentiment</a> and <a href="Ukrainization">Ukrainization</a> of the crew, but nevertheless raised the <a href="flag%20of%20Ukraine">flag of Ukraine</a> on his return to Sevastopol on October 25. From this moment desertion and "volunteering" into the <a href="Red%20Guards%20%28Russia%29">Red Guards</a> intensified, and by December 21 the crew was reduced to 460 enlisted men and 28 officers. In January 1918 the fleet disintegrated completely: the officers fled from the enraged enlisted men, then the enlisted men abandoned the ships and fled from the advancing German Army. On April 29, 1918, the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s managed to extricate two battleships and sixteen destroyers from Sevastopol to <a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a>, but "Rostislav" and the rest of the fleet remained in Sevastopol.

The German occupation of <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> from May to November 1918 did not affect the abandoned ship. The Anglo-French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919. Before leaving, the British destroyed "Rostislav"s engines on April 25. The <a href="White%20movement">White forces</a> of <a href="Pyotr%20Nikolayevich%20Wrangel">Baron Wrangel</a> used the disabled ship as a <a href="floating%20battery">floating battery</a> in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a>. The ship, manned by a ragtag volunteer crew, was stationed in the shallow waters of the <a href="Kerch%20Strait">Kerch Strait</a> to harass the Reds in <a href="Taman%2C%20Russia">Taman</a> and prevent a landing in the Crimea. After the defeat of Wrangel's land forces, the crew <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a> "Rostislav" in the Kerch Strait to prevent the Red forces from breaking through to the Black Sea.

When "Rostislav" sank in the shallows her superstructure remained above water. In 1930, the <a href="EPRON">EPRON</a> (a Soviet salvage unit) retrieved the ship's guns and partially dismantled the hull. According to diver Alexander Yolkin, the remains of the hull are still lying in the strait, around from the Ukrainian coast, and gradually sinking into the <a href="silt">silt</a>.

Heinrich Bär

Heinrich "Pritzl" Bär (; 25 May 1913 – 28 April 1957) was a German <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> who served throughout <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in Europe. Bär flew more than one thousand combat missions, and fought in the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean</a> theatres. On 18 occasions he survived being shot down, and according to records in the <a href="German%20Federal%20Archives">German Federal Archives</a>, he claimed to have shot down 228 enemy aircraft and was credited with 208 aerial victories, around 16 of which were in a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20262">Messerschmitt Me 262</a> <a href="jet%20fighter">jet fighter</a>.

Bär, a native of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>, joined the <a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a> in 1934 and transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1935. Serving first as a mechanic, then as a pilot on transport aircraft, he was informally trained as a fighter pilot. He claimed his first aerial victory in September 1939 on the French border. By the end of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, his tally of victories had increased to 17. Transferred to the Eastern Front to participate in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>, he quickly accumulated further victories, a feat that earned him the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%20and%20Swords">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords</a> for 90 aerial victories in February 1942.

During the remainder of World War II, Bär was credited with 130 other aerial victories, including 16 while flying one of the first jet fighters, the Me 262, an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</a>. <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>'s personal dislike of Bär, coupled with Bär's insubordinate character and lack of military discipline, deprived him of this award. After World War II, Bär continued his career as an aviator. He was killed in a flying accident on 28 April 1957 near Braunschweig.

Bär was born on 25 May 1913 in Sommerfeld near <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saxony">Kingdom of Saxony</a>, a <a href="federated%20state">federated state</a> of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. His parents were farmers, and in 1916, his father was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Bär attended the "<a href="Volksschule">Volksschule</a>", a combined primary and lower secondary school, in Sommerfeld. Initially, he planned on taking over the family farm in Engelsdorf and following graduation attended the <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> school in <a href="Wurzen">Wurzen</a>. Aged 15, he became a <a href="Gliding">glider pilot</a>, joining the <a href="Glider%20%28sailplane%29">glider</a> club on the ""Schwarzer Berg"" (Black Mountain) at <a href="Taucha">Taucha</a>. Bär then wanted to become a forester, for everything associated with wildlife and forests interested him. His first sight of a <a href="Junkers">Junkers</a> transport aircraft changed his mind and convinced him that he should become an aviator. As a teenager, he had ambitions to become an airline pilot with <a href="Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa">Deutsche Luft Hansa</a>. He acquired the nickname "Pritzl" because of his affection for Pritzl candy bars.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> prevented Bär from gaining a civil pilot license. In 1934, he joined the <a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a> and was assigned to the 3. "Kompanie" of "Kraftfahrabteilung 4" (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, Bär attended the flight school at <a href="Oldenburg">Oldenburg</a> and was then transferred to the flight school at <a href="Hildesheim">Hildesheim</a>. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at <a href="Ludwigslust">Ludwigslust</a> where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate ("Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein"), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. Bär then attended the <a href="blind%20flying">blind flying</a> school "Blindflugschule" 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at <a href="Neuburg%20an%20der%20Donau">Neuburg an der Donau</a> from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./"Jagdgeschwader" 135, the core of the future <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2051">"Jagdgeschwader" 51</a> (JG 51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2086">Junkers Ju 86</a>. The <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> ("<a href="Staffelkapit%C3%A4n">Staffelkapitän</a>") Douglas Pitcairn noticed Bär's flying talents and tried to convince Bär to become a fighter pilot. Initially Bär refused, but after he illegally conducted some <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a> in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.

Stationed on the border with France, Bär achieved his first victory—a <a href="Curtiss%20P-36%20Hawk">Curtiss P-36 Hawk</a>—on 25 September 1939 during the <a href="Phoney%20War">Phoney War</a> air skirmishes with the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Arm%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27Air%20%281909%E2%80%931942%29">"Armée de l'Air"</a> (French air force). This earned him the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> 2nd Class () on 29 September 1939 which was presented to him by <a href="Hugo%20Sperrle">Hugo Sperrle</a>. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a>, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class () on 6 July 1940. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> on 2 September 1940 by a <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, "Your speech, Herr "<a href="Reichsmarschall">Reichsmarschall</a>", in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF), bringing his total to 17.

In June 1941, JG 51 was transferred East to take part in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> with 1 "staffel". On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman "<a href="Oberfeldwebel">Oberfeldwebel</a>" Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> over German lines when they made contact with 18 <a href="Tupolev%20SB">Tupolev SB</a> bombers from the 39 SBAP ("Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk"—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD ("Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya"—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked <a href="self-sealing%20fuel%20tank">self-sealing fuel tank</a>s and had a propensity to burst into flames. More JG 51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 18 <a href="Tupolev%20SB">Tupolev SB</a> bombers from the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.

JG 51 at the time was part of the <a href="2nd%20Air%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">"Fliegerkorps" II</a>, operating in the central sector of the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>. Bär claimed five aerial victories on 30 June 1941, bringing his total to 22. On this day JG 51 was credited with 113 aerial victories in total, among them their 1,000th aerial victory—the first unit to reach this figure—and "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" <a href="Werner%20M%C3%B6lders">Werner Mölders</a>, with 82 aerial victories, surpassed <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a> in number of victories. The "Geschwader" recorded 24 separate engagements in a 14-hour period and lost five Bf 109s. Bär's opponents included <a href="Ilyushin%20DB-3">Ilyushin DB-3</a> bombers from the 42nd and 52nd DBA ("Dal'me-Bombardirovochnaya Aviatsiya"—long range aviation bomber regiment). Five <a href="Tupolev%20TB-3">Tupolev TB-3</a>s from the 3rd TBAP were also claimed.

Within two weeks of combat against the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a>, Bär's tally rose to 27, which earned him the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> () on 2 July, followed by his promotion to "<a href="Oberleutnant">Oberleutnant</a>" on 1 August 1941. On 5 July, Bär or Mölders may also have shot down the Soviet fighter ace "Podpolkovnik" (<a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a>) Stepan Suprun from the 401 IAP ("Istrebitel'nyy Aviatsionyy Polk"—fighter aviation regiment) and holder of the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. Bär accounted for a <a href="Petlyakov%20Pe-2">Petlyakov Pe-2</a> on 23 July. Three were lost from the 411 BAP ("Bombardirovochnyy Aviatsionyy Polk"—bomber aviation regiment) operating under the OSNAZ ("Osoboye Naznachenie"—Special purpose-unit or task force). German pilots submitted three claims. On 9 August an SB bomber was claimed from a formation of eight belonging to the 57 BAP's 3rd "Eskadrilya"—five Soviet aircraft were shot down. Bär had achieved his 55th victory.

On 14 August, he was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves</a> () for 60 victories, and on 30 August he became an "<a href="Aviators%20who%20became%20ace%20in%20a%20day">ace-in-a-day</a>" by shooting down six Soviet aircraft. On 31 August, Bär was shot down by an <a href="Ilyushin%20Il-2">Ilyushin Il-2</a> some behind Soviet lines, near Novgorod-Seversky. He suffered injuries to his back and feet while bailing out. Bär evaded Soviet patrols which rushed to the crash site. Bär remained in hiding through to the following night. He turned his leather jacket inside-out and discarded his <a href="Sheepskin%20boots">flying boots</a> to present himself as a Russian peasant. Vanity prevented him from throwing away the Knight's Cross and Oak Leaves and he hid the items. Bär eventually made it to German lines but aggravated his injuries and spent two months in hospital.

Bär was promoted to "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" in late 1941 and appointed Squadron Leader of 12./JG 51 in early 1942. By late 1941, after Mölders (115), Lützow (100), Galland (96) and Gollob (85), Bär's 80 placed him among the leading pilots of the war. His longtime <a href="wingman">wingman</a> at the time was <a href="Heinrich%20Hoffmann%20%28pilot%29">Heinrich Hoffmann</a>. From January he was appointed "<a href="Gruppenkommandeur">Gruppenkommandeur</a>" (Group Commander) of IV "Gruppe". At this time JG 51 was only the second of two fighter groups that continued to operate the Bf 109E in the winter, 1941. He received the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%20and%20Swords">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords</a> () on 16 February as his tally rose to 90. This achievement was mentioned in the daily "<a href="Wehrmachtbericht">Wehrmachtbericht</a>" propaganda bulletin on 12 February 1942, his first of three references during the course of the war. Three months later he was referenced again.

On 11 May, Bär was transferred from IV./JG 51 on the Moscow front to take command of I. "Gruppe" of <a href="Gordon%20Gollob">Gordon Gollob</a>'s <a href="Jagdgeschwader%2077">"Jagdgeschwader" 77</a> (JG 77) flying wing. Bär replaced <a href="Herbert%20Ihlefeld">Herbert Ihlefeld</a> who had been transferred. JG 77 was tasked with supporting the hard fighting in the <a href="Crimean%20Campaign">Crimean Campaign</a> over the <a href="Kerch%20Strait">Kerch Strait</a> on the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>. Led by the <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>s ("Experten") Gollob and Bär, JG 77 took over the air space above Kerch-Taman as Gollob and Bär shot down two and three <a href="Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov%20LaGG-3">LaGG-3s</a> respectively, raising Bär's victory total to 93. Mutual animosity between the two men, Gollob, a disciplinarian pro-Nazi, and Bär, an anti-authoritarian, ensured an intense rivalry. On 19 May 1942, Bär claimed five further aerial victories—including a <a href="Polikarpov%20R-5">Polikarpov R-5</a> in the morning and four <a href="Polikarpov%20I-16">Polikarpov I-16</a>s in one afternoon mission: his victory total now stood at 103. He was the 9th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. That same day, <a href="Inspector%20of%20Fighters">Inspector of Fighters</a> ("General der Jagdflieger") <a href="Adolf%20Galland">Adolf Galland</a> arrived to inspect Bär's I./JG 77 and JG 77 surpassed 2,000 victories. This flying achievement earned Bär a second mention in the daily "Wehrmachtbericht" on 20 May 1942.

In June 1942, JG 77 was moved to the <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean theater</a> and took part in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29">air battles over Malta</a> before relocating to <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and participating in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>. On 13 October 1942 he accounted for three Spitfire fighters from <a href="No.%20185%20Squadron%20RAF">185</a> and 1345 Squadron near the Sicilian coast. I./JG 77 soon transferred to <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> and took part in the <a href="Tunisian%20Campaign">Tunisian Campaign</a>.

On 1 January 1943 Bär submitted one of two claims against 12 <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawk</a>s of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">3 Squadron RAAF</a>. <a href="Flying%20Officer">Flying Officer</a> Ritchie and <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> Roediger were lost but Bär did not receive credit. Bär claimed two <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bombers and three P-40s on 14 January which do not appear to have been credited. Two claims for P-40s destroyed on the 18 January were also not granted.

On 25 January 1943, Bär claimed two <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40</a> Kittyhawk/Warhawk fighters, taking his total to 149 aerial victories. The Allied units involved were <a href="No.%20112%20Squadron%20RAF">112 Sqn RAF</a>, <a href="No.%20450%20Squadron%20RAAF">450 Sqn RAAF</a>, <a href="65th%20Fighter%20Squadron">65th FS, USAAF</a> and <a href="66th%20Fighter%20Squadron">66th FS, USAAF</a>. (A South African bomber squadron, <a href="21%20Squadron%20SAAF">21 Squadron SAAF</a>, was also reportedly involved.) The Germans claimed 10 P-40s. 450 and 112 Squadrons lost one each while the 65th Squadron lost three and the 66th two. After Bär achieved his 149th aerial victory, General <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Arnim">Hans-Jürgen von Arnim</a> submitted him for the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</a> (). "<a href="Reichsmarschall">Reichsmarschall</a>" <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> ignored this request, denying Bär the "Diamonds". The reason for this remains uncertain, but it is believed that Göring disliked Bär for his insubordinate character and strong <a href="Upper%20Saxon%20German">Saxon</a> dialect, which Göring was known to detest. On 27 January 1943, Bär surpassed the 150 aerial victory mark. Bär's opponents were probably USAAF P-40s and <a href="P-39%20Airacobra">P-39 Airacobra</a>s from the <a href="33rd%20Fighter%20Group">33rd</a> and <a href="81st%20Fighter%20Group">81st Fighter Group</a>.

On 4 February Bär led I. "Gruppe" into action against <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bombers from the <a href="97th%20Bombardment%20Group">97th</a> and 301st Bomb Group and their <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">Lockheed P-38 Lightning</a> escorts from the <a href="1st%20Fighter%20Group">1st Fighter Group</a>. Bär claimed one B-17. On 15 February Bär claimed two USAAF Spitfires. The American pilots were possibly <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Joe Reed and H. E Huntingdon from the <a href="31st%20Fighter%20Group">31st Fighter Group</a>. After an uncredited claim on 24 February over a P-40 Bär accounted for five on two days later. German fighter units claimed 13 against an actual 14 (possible 15) and several more damaged. Seven of the British pilots were unhurt. The following day he was credited with another P-40 in combat with 11 pilots from <a href="4%20Squadron%20SAAF">4 Squadron SAAF</a>. Records suggest he may have claimed three but was only credited with one.
Bär and his I. Gruppe of JG 77 operated from <a href="Fatnassa">Fatnassa</a>, Tunisia, in early March 1943. On 1st or 2 March, Bär claimed a Spitfire shot down. Then in the evening met Galland, who was making a surprise visit to I./JG 77. Galland was greeted by "<a href="Major%20%28Germany%29">Major</a>" <a href="Joachim%20M%C3%BCncheberg">Joachim Müncheberg</a>, who introduced Bär to Galland. Thus began a comradeship which outlasted World War II. On 6 March <a href="No.%2092%20Squadron%20RAF">92 Squadron</a> Spitfires provided cover for <a href="1%20Squadron%20SAAF">1 SAAF Squadron</a>. They were supported by <a href="No.%20601%20Squadron%20RAF">601</a>. Bär spotted their approach and climbed then dived onto the British. Bär accounted for two Spitfires—<a href="Flight%20Sergeant">Flight Sergeant</a> Tilston, from 601, was forced to bale out and <a href="Flying%20Officer">Flying Officer</a> Mahon from the South African unit was killed.

Over North Africa and the Mediterranean theater, Bär had increased his tally to 179, but, fighting a losing battle against ever-increasing Allied air superiority, Bär lost his fighting spirit, and suffered severe mental and physical exhaustion. After several arguments with JG 77's new Commander Colonel <a href="Johannes%20Steinhoff">Johannes Steinhoff</a> and <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>, in mid-1943 Bär was transferred to France "for cowardice before the enemy" and demoted to Squadron Leader. He took over command of an operational training unit, "<a href="Jagdgruppe%20S%C3%BCd">Jagdgruppe Süd</a>".

His combat skills were hard to overlook and hence Bär was transferred to II./<a href="Jagdgeschwader%201%20%28World%20War%20II%29">"Jagdgeschwader" 1</a> (JG 1) on 21 January 1944 as an ordinary pilot. He was assigned to 6./JG 1. "Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JG 1) <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> ("<a href="Geschwaderkommodore">Geschwaderkommodore</a>") Colonel <a href="Walter%20Oesau">Walter Oesau</a> welcomed him with a reminder that he had promised "<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Luftwaffe">Oberkommando der Luftwaffe</a>" (OKL) Göring that Bär would not be given any command responsibilities. Although Bär accepted this with humor, he later commented to others that in the air he was the "Kommodore of his own crate".

On 15 March 1944, Bär, now a "Major" and rehabilitated from the demotion, was given command of II./"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JG 1). This was after the death of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JG 1 was tasked with "Reichsverteidigung" (<a href="Defense%20of%20the%20Reich">Defense of the Reich</a>) and equipped with the <a href="Focke-Wulf%20190">Focke Wulf 190 A-7</a> fighter. Morale of the group soared following his appointment. He was considered the unofficial leader of the group and the best officer in the entire "Geschwader". On 11 April 1944, Bär achieved his 199th aerial victory over a B-17 near <a href="Fallersleben">Fallersleben</a>. His 200th aerial victory, a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a>, was claimed on 22 April accompanied by his regular wingman <a href="Warrant%20Officer">Warrant Officer</a> ("<a href="Oberfeldwebel">Oberfeldwebel</a>") <a href="Leo%20Schuhmacher">Leo Schuhmacher</a>, who would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a fighter pilot in II./JG 1. Bär had just landed at Störmede airfield from a II./JG 1 intercept when a smoking <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) B-24 of the <a href="458th%20Bombardment%20Group">458th Bombardment Group</a> passed overhead. Bär and his wingman quickly got into their aircraft and intercepted the B-24. The bomber's gunners had already bailed out of the aircraft, making it an easy aerial victory. Bär returned to Störmede airfield to the congratulations of his men. This double century victory earned Bär his third and final reference in the "Wehrmachtbericht" on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's death on 11 May 1944, Bär was made acting Wing Commander of JG 1. In June, he was appointed Wing Commander of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%203">"Jagdgeschwader" 3</a> (JG 3) following the death of <a href="Friedrich-Karl%20%26quot%3BTutti%26quot%3B%20M%C3%BCller">Friedrich-Karl Müller</a>. By the end of 1944, Bär's score had risen to 203.

Bär's 204th and 205th victories, against two <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon</a>s, were achieved on 1 January 1945 during "<a href="Unternehmen%20Bodenplatte">Unternehmen Bodenplatte</a>", a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> area. The operation resulted in hundreds of aircraft losses on both sides. Bär's JG 3 contributed by raiding <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a> in the Netherlands, shooting down about six RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground. One of Bär's 'aerial kills' may not have been airborne. Historian <a href="Norman%20Franks">Norman Franks</a> states both aircraft, from <a href="No.%20438%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 438 Squadron RAF</a>, were taxiing when hit. <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> Pete Wilson was wounded and later died from his injuries after Bär's <a href="strafing">strafing</a> attack. The second Typhoon did get airborne. Its pilot, <a href="Flight%20Officer">Flight Officer</a> Ross Keller was killed. This version of events is contradicted by a witness, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both aircraft were airborne.

In February, Bär was transferred to command the <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">jet fighter</a> training unit III./<a href="Erg%C3%A4nzungs-Jagdgeschwader%202">"Ergänzungs-Jagdgeschwader" 2</a> (EJG 2). In March, the unit was equipped with the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20262">Messerschmitt Me 262</a> fighter and sent into battle. Bär shot down 13 Allied aircraft, many of them heavy bombers like the B-17 and the B-24. EJG 2 abandoned <a href="Lechfeld">Lechfeld</a> for the airfield was under constant attack and was now threatened by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. 

On 23 April, Bär transferred to the elite "Jet Experten" unit <a href="Jagdverband%2044">"Jagdverband" 44</a> (JV 44), led by <a href="Adolf%20Galland">Adolf Galland</a>. The following day Bär briefed JV 44 pilots in Galland's absence. The air defences had detected an incoming American formation and Bär instructed the jet pilots on the appropriate tactical approach to take when the interception was made. <a href="Klaus%20Neumann">Klaus Neumann</a>, <a href="Walter%20Krupinski">Walter Krupinski</a> and <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20L%C3%BCtzow">Günther Lützow</a> flew on the mission. Lutzöw was posted missing in action and remains missing to date.

On 26 April, he assumed command of the unitafter Galland was wounded. Bär possibly flew his first operational sortie with JV 44 on 27 April 1945. Flying the Me 262 A-1/U5, a six <a href="MK%20108%20cannon">MK 108 cannon</a> prototype, he was accompanied by "Major" <a href="Wilhelm%20Herget">Wilhelm Herget</a> and the <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a> NCO ("<a href="Unteroffizier">Unteroffizier</a>") <a href="Franz%20K%C3%B6ster">Franz Köster</a> when the trio engaged American fighters over <a href="Riem">Riem</a>; Bär claimed one aerial victory. While not flying operationally, Bär spent most of his time giving hasty instruction to the new pilots still being assigned to JV 44. With JV 44, he achieved his final four aerial victories (3 <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47s</a> and 1 <a href="De%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a>) on 28 April, bringing his total to 220. All told, he had achieved 16 victories in the Me 262, making him the second most successful "Jet Expert" of the war, which he finished as a <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> ("<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>").
During the final days of the Second World War in Europe, <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> ("Generalleutnant") Adolf Galland attempted to surrender JV 44 to American forces from his hospital bed. At the same time <a href="General%20officer">Air General</a> ("General der Flieger") <a href="Karl%20Koller%20%28general%29">Karl Koller</a> had ordered JV 44 to relocate to <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and continue fighting. Bär, as a Galland loyalist, attempted to ignore the order. Bär was further pressured to relocate JV 44 when <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> ("<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>") <a href="Dietrich%20Peltz">Dietrich Peltz</a>, commander of "<a href="9th%20Air%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">IX. Fliegerkorps</a>", and Colonel <a href="Hajo%20Herrmann">Hajo Herrmann</a>, commander of <a href="9th%20Air%20Division%20%28Germany%29">9. Flieger-Division (J)</a>, unexpectedly emerged at the control room in <a href="Salzburg">Maxglan</a> on 2 May 1945. A heated and violent dispute erupted between Bär, Peltz and Herrmann, witnessed by <a href="Walter%20Krupinski">Walter Krupinski</a>. He later recalled that Bär responded with "Yes, sir, but we are under the command of "Generalleutnant" Galland, and I will only follow orders of "Generalleutnant" Galland!"—a final act of disobedience that Krupinski believed could have led to Bär being shot for insubordination.

In the early morning hours of 4 May 1945, Bär gathered the pilots of JV 44 for a final briefing. Bär ordered the remaining Me 262 destroyed before going into captivity and interrogation by US Intelligence officers of the 1st Tactical Air Force's Air Prisoner of War Interrogation Unit, based at <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>.

Bär did not return to his home in Sommerfeld after World War II. He settled in <a href="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>, where he continued his career in aviation, including a lead position for motor-powered flight with the "Deutscher Aero Club". He also worked as a consultant and <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a> in the field of sport aviation, testing aircraft before they went on the market. On 28 April 1957, while conducting a routine flight-check in a light aircraft, a <a href="LF-1%20Zaunk%C3%B6nig">LF-1 Zaunkönig</a>, Bär put the aircraft into a flat spin, the final manoeuvre in the test process. The aircraft spun down to then, unable to regain control, Bär was killed in the resulting crash at Braunschweig-Waggum.

The "<a href="National-Zeitung">National-Zeitung</a>", a far-right German newspaper, featured a portrayal of Bär in its series "Great German Soldiers: Immortal Heroes" in May 2000. The National-Zeitung glorified Bär's "reliability" and "bravado" and claimed that he was a "daredevil in the best sense". In "Jagdgeschwader" 51, the newspaper continued, he quickly gained fame and honour through daring actions; after his total of 18 kills, he had been "immediately back in action" with barely treated wounds. In the series, only soldiers loyal to the Nazi regime were honoured, in part through the use of linguistic formulas originally employed by the <a href="Wehrmacht%20Propaganda%20Troops">Wehrmacht</a> and <a href="Nazi%20propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a>.

According to the political scientist , the series fits "the idea of men focused on the deed and shaping the course of history in the interest of the 'national' or 'völkisch’ community", an idea, which is to be found on the far right. At the same time, Virchow argues, the characterizations point to a concept of masculinity whose very one-sided characteristics could be described by qualities such as "hardness", "sacrificial will", "heroism in the face of death", "bravery", "resilience", "dash" or "stamina".

Bär, <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a> "Bussard 1", flew more than 1,000 combat missions. His 220 confirmed aerial victories place him eighth on the overall list of "Experten". His claim of 124 aerial victories over Western-flown aircraft is second only to <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Marseille">Hans-Joachim Marseille</a>'s total of 158; almost all of the latter's victories occurred in Africa.

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in <a href="Reading%2C%20Pennsylvania">Reading, Pennsylvania</a>. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a> for <a href="Merrill%20Lynch">Merrill Lynch</a>, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift ( Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a <a href="mutual%20fund">mutual fund</a> marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter <a href="James%20Taylor">James Taylor</a>. She has a younger brother named <a href="Austin%20Swift">Austin</a>, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia <a href="Montessori">Montessori</a> School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to <a href="The%20Wyndcroft%20School">The Wyndcroft School</a>. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of <a href="Wyomissing%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wyomissing, Pennsylvania</a>, where she attended <a href="Wyomissing%20Area%20Junior/Senior%20High%20School">Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School</a>.

At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by <a href="Shania%20Twain">Shania Twain</a>'s songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about <a href="Faith%20Hill">Faith Hill</a>, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a> and <a href="Dixie%20Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a> karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different".

When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing "Lucky You". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for <a href="Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a <a href="Maybelline">Maybelline</a> compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels. After performing original songs at an <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a> showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.

To help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to the Nashville office of <a href="Merrill%20Lynch">Merrill Lynch</a> when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in <a href="Hendersonville%2C%20Tennessee">Hendersonville, Tennessee</a>. Swift attended <a href="Hendersonville%20High%20School%20%28Tennessee%29">Hendersonville High School</a>, but after two years transferred to the Aaron Academy, which through homeschooling could accommodate her touring schedule, and she graduated a year early.

In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as <a href="Troy%20Verges">Troy Verges</a>, <a href="Brett%20Beavers">Brett Beavers</a>, <a href="Brett%20James">Brett James</a>, <a href="Mac%20McAnally">Mac McAnally</a>, and <a href="The%20Warren%20Brothers">The Warren Brothers</a>. She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with <a href="Liz%20Rose">Liz Rose</a>. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the <a href="Sony/ATV%20Music%20Publishing">Sony/ATV Tree publishing house</a>, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".
Swift was at an industry showcase at Nashville's <a href="Bluebird%20Cafe">Bluebird Cafe</a> in 2005 when she caught the attention of <a href="Scott%20Borchetta">Scott Borchetta</a>, a <a href="DreamWorks%20Records">DreamWorks Records</a> executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, <a href="Big%20Machine%20Records">Big Machine Records</a>. She had met Borchetta in 2004. Swift became one of the record label's first signings, and her father purchased a three percent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000. She began working on her <a href="Taylor%20Swift%20%28album%29">eponymous debut album</a> shortly after signing the record deal, and persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer <a href="Nathan%20Chapman%20%28record%20producer%29">Nathan Chapman</a>, with whom she felt she had the right "chemistry". Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, <a href="Robert%20Ellis%20Orrall">Robert Ellis Orrall</a>, Brian Maher, and <a href="Angelo%20Petraglia">Angelo Petraglia</a>. "Taylor Swift" was released on October 24, 2006. Jon Caramanica of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described it as "a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice". "Taylor Swift" peaked at number five on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> albums chart in the United States and spent 157 weeks on the ranking, marking the longest stay on the chart by any release in the country in the 2000s decade. As of August 2016 the album has sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.

Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>, "<a href="Tim%20McGraw%20%28song%29">Tim McGraw</a>", and Swift and her mother helped "stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio". She spent much of 2006 promoting "Taylor Swift" with a radio tour and television appearances. Borchetta has said that record industry peers disliked his signing of a 16-year-old singer-songwriter at first, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music. Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "<a href="Teardrops%20on%20My%20Guitar">Teardrops on My Guitar</a>", "<a href="Our%20Song%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Our Song</a>", "<a href="Picture%20to%20Burn">Picture to Burn</a>" and "<a href="Should%27ve%20Said%20No">Should've Said No</a>". All were highly successful on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s <a href="Hot%20Country%20Songs">Hot Country Songs</a> chart in the United States, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" both reaching number one. For the former, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart. "Teardrops on My Guitar" became a moderate commercial success, reaching number thirteen on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> songs chart in the United States. Swift also released the holiday album "" in October 2007 and the EP "<a href="Beautiful%20Eyes">Beautiful Eyes</a>" in July 2008. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.

Swift won accolades for "Taylor Swift".

The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" found "serious comedic potential". In a scathing review, the critic for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" deemed her "entirely undirected", arguing that "she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy".

In March 2014, Swift relocated to New York City. Around this time, she was working on her fifth studio album, "<a href="1989%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20album%29">1989</a>", with writers Antonoff, <a href="Max%20Martin">Max Martin</a>, <a href="Shellback%20%28record%20producer%29">Shellback</a>, <a href="Imogen%20Heap">Imogen Heap</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Tedder">Ryan Tedder</a>, and <a href="Ali%20Payami">Ali Payami</a>. She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions, called the ""1989" Secret Sessions". Credited as her "first documented, official pop album", it marked a departure from her previous country albums. The album was released on October 27, 2014 to positive reviews.
"1989" sold 1.28 million copies in the US during the first week of release and debuted atop the "Billboard" 200—this made Swift the first act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their opening release week, for which she earned a "Guinness World Record". As of June 2017, "1989" had sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, "<a href="Shake%20It%20Off">Shake It Off</a>", was released in August 2014 and debuted at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The album also generated two additional number-one singles—"<a href="Blank%20Space">Blank Space</a>" and "<a href="Bad%20Blood%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Bad Blood</a>" (featuring <a href="Kendrick%20Lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a>)—as well as the top-ten entries "<a href="Style%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Style</a>" and "<a href="Wildest%20Dreams%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Wildest Dreams</a>", and other singles "<a href="Out%20of%20the%20Woods%20%28song%29">Out of the Woods</a>" and "<a href="New%20Romantics%20%28song%29">New Romantics</a>". "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" also topped the charts in Australia and Canada. After "Blank Space" reached number-one in the US following "Shake It Off", Swift became the first woman in the Hot 100's history to succeed herself at the top spot. The music video for the former briefly became the fastest video to reach one billion views on <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>. The videos for "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" won four accolades at the <a href="2015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2015 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, with the latter winning for <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a> and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Collaboration">Best Collaboration</a>. Swift's headlining tour, <a href="the%201989%20World%20Tour">the 1989 World Tour</a>, running from May to December 2015, grossed over $250 million, and became <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20concert%20tours">one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade</a>.

Swift was named "Billboard"s Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice. Also that year, she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202014">American Music Awards</a>. In 2015, "Shake It Off" was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year and Swift won the <a href="Brit%20Award%20for%20International%20Female%20Solo%20Artist">Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist</a>. Swift was one of eight artists to receive a 50th Anniversary Milestone Award at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards. In 2016, Swift won three Grammy Awards for "1989"—Album of the Year, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Best Pop Vocal Album</a>, and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Video">Best Music Video</a> for "Bad Blood". She became the first woman, and fifth act overall, to win the first of these twice.

Prior to "1989"s release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a>, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized <a href="Apple%20Music">Apple Music</a> for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull "1989" from the catalog. The following day, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period, and Swift agreed to stream "1989" on the streaming service. Swift's <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 <a href="trademark">trademark</a>s related to Swift and the "1989" era memes. She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, <a href="Amazon%20Music">Amazon Music</a> and <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a> in June 2017.

In 2015, Swift performed "<a href="I%20Saw%20Her%20Standing%20There">I Saw Her Standing There</a>" and "Shake It Off" with <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> at the "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live%2040th%20Anniversary%20Special">Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special</a>" after-party, and joined <a href="Kenny%20Chesney">Kenny Chesney</a> to sing "<a href="Big%20Star%20%28Kenny%20Chesney%20song%29">Big Star</a>" on the opening night of his <a href="The%20Big%20Revival%20Tour">Big Revival Tour</a> in Nashville. In March 2015, Swift started dating Scottish DJ and record producer <a href="Calvin%20Harris">Calvin Harris</a>. By June 2015, the duo were ranked as the highest-paid celebrity couple over the past year by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" with combined earnings of over $146 million. Before Swift and Harris announced the end of their relationship in June 2016, the two co-wrote his song "<a href="This%20Is%20What%20You%20Came%20For">This Is What You Came For</a>" (featuring <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>), for which she was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg. The same month Swift started dating English actor <a href="Tom%20Hiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a>; the relationship ended several months later. In August, Swift addressed her mother's <a href="cancer">cancer</a> diagnosis, and encouraged others to get a <a href="general%20medical%20examination">medical checkup</a>. In September 2016, Swift began dating English actor <a href="Joe%20Alwyn">Joe Alwyn</a>. In October, she penned <a href="Little%20Big%20Town">Little Big Town</a>'s "<a href="Better%20Man%20%28Little%20Big%20Town%20song%29">Better Man</a>" for their seventh album, "<a href="The%20Breaker%20%28Little%20Big%20Town%20album%29">The Breaker</a>". The song earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the <a href="51st%20Annual%20Country%20Music%20Association%20Awards">51st CMA Awards</a>. Two months later, Swift and <a href="Zayn%20Malik">Zayn Malik</a> released a single together called "<a href="I%20Don%27t%20Wanna%20Live%20Forever">I Don't Wanna Live Forever</a>", for the of the film "<a href="Fifty%20Shades%20Darker%20%28film%29">Fifty Shades Darker</a>" (2017). The song reached number one in Sweden and peaked at number two in the United States. At the <a href="2017%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2017 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, the duo won the award for Best Collaboration for the song's music video.

In August 2017, Swift sued and prevailed in a civil trial against David Mueller, a former morning show personality for <a href="Denver">Denver</a>'s <a href="KYGO-FM">KYGO-FM</a>. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for making him lose his job. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault. The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift. Swift thereafter cleared her social media accounts and released "<a href="Look%20What%20You%20Made%20Me%20Do">Look What You Made Me Do</a>" as the lead single from her sixth album, "<a href="Reputation%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20album%29">Reputation</a>" (stylized as "reputation)". The song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its music video gained over 43.2 million views during its first day on YouTube, breaking the site's record for the most-viewed music video within 24 hours. In October, Swift released the album's second single, "<a href="...Ready%20for%20It%3F">...Ready for It?</a>", which charted at number three in Australia and at number four in the United States.
Two promotional singles were released from "Reputation", "<a href="Gorgeous%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Gorgeous</a>" and "<a href="Call%20It%20What%20You%20Want%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Call It What You Want</a>"; the former later became the album's fifth single, however only being released as such in Europe. The album was released on November 10 and sold 1.216 million copies in the United States—becoming 2017's top-selling album (pure sales only) in the country—and 2 million copies worldwide during its first week. With this achievement, she became the first act to have four albums <a href="Lists%20of%20fastest-selling%20albums">sell one million copies within one week</a> in the US. The album topped the charts in several countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and Canada. Later that month, Swift performed "...Ready for It?" and "Call It What You Want" on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". "<a href="End%20Game%20%28song%29">End Game</a>", featuring <a href="Ed%20Sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> and <a href="Future%20%28rapper%29">Future</a>, followed in November as the third single, and peaked at number 18 in the US. Other singles from the album include "<a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">New Year's Day</a>" and "<a href="Delicate%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29">Delicate</a>", the former of which was released exclusively to country radio.

In April 2018, Swift featured on <a href="Sugarland">Sugarland</a>'s "<a href="Babe%20%28Sugarland%20song%29">Babe</a>" from their album "<a href="Bigger%20%28album%29">Bigger</a>". In support of "Reputation", Swift embarked on <a href="Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Reputation%20Stadium%20Tour">Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour</a> from May to November 2018. The tour broke multiple venue attendance and grossing records in the United States, earning $266.1 million and selling more than two million tickets. As a result, Swift broke her own record for the highest-grossing domestic tour by a woman and surpassed <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' $245 million-grossing <a href="A%20Bigger%20Bang%20Tour">A Bigger Bang Tour</a> (2005–2007). Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7 million, making it the second highest-grossing concert tour of the year. At the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202018">American Music Awards of 2018</a>, Swift won <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Tour%20of%20the%20Year">Tour of the Year</a> for the tour, <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Artist%20of%20the%20Year">Artist of the Year</a>, <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Favorite%20Pop/Rock%20Female%20Artist">Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist</a>, and <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Favorite%20Pop/Rock%20Album">Favorite Pop/Rock Album</a> for "Reputation". With a total of 23 awards, she became the most awarded female winner in AMA history, a record previously held by <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>. "Reputation" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Pop Vocal Album category.

In July 2018, Swift was cast as <a href="Bombalurina%20%28cat%29">Bombalurina</a> in the <a href="Cats%20%282019%20film%29">movie adaptation</a> of the musical "<a href="Cats%20%28musical%29">Cats</a>". "Reputation" was Swift's last album under her 12-year contract with <a href="Big%20Machine%20Records">Big Machine Records</a>. In November 2018, Swift signed a new multi-album deal with Big Machine's distributor <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a>; in the United States, her future releases will be promoted under the <a href="Republic%20Records">Republic Records</a> imprint. Swift stated that the contract included provisions for her to maintain ownership of her <a href="master%20recording">master recording</a>s. In addition, UMG agreed to, in the event that it sells portions of its stake in <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a>, distribute proceeds among its artists and make them non-recoupable.

One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by "the great female country artists of the '90s"—Shania Twain, <a href="Faith%20Hill">Faith Hill</a>, and the <a href="Dixie%20Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a>. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: "Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's "<a href="Cowboy%20Take%20Me%20Away">Cowboy Take Me Away</a>" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a>, <a href="Loretta%20Lynn">Loretta Lynn</a>, <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a>, and <a href="Tammy%20Wynette">Tammy Wynette</a>. She believes Parton is "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there". <a href="Alt-country">Alt-country</a> artists such as <a href="Ryan%20Adams">Ryan Adams</a>, <a href="Patty%20Griffin">Patty Griffin</a> and <a href="Lori%20McKenna">Lori McKenna</a> have inspired Swift.

Swift lists Paul McCartney, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="Emmylou%20Harris">Emmylou Harris</a>, <a href="Kris%20Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a>, and <a href="Carly%20Simon">Carly Simon</a> as her career role models: "They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers". McCartney, both as a <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatle</a> and a solo artist, makes Swift feel "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that". She admires Springsteen for being "so musically relevant after such a long period of time". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: "It's not about fame for her, it's about music". "[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out", Swift says. She admires Simon's "songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person".

Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a> acts including <a href="Hanson%20%28band%29">Hanson</a> and <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>; Swift has said she has "unwavering devotion" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as <a href="Dashboard%20Confessional">Dashboard Confessional</a>, <a href="Fall%20Out%20Boy">Fall Out Boy</a>, and <a href="Jimmy%20Eat%20World">Jimmy Eat World</a>. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like <a href="Michelle%20Branch">Michelle Branch</a>, <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>, <a href="Ashlee%20Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>, <a href="Fefe%20Dobson">Fefe Dobson</a>, <a href="Colbie%20Caillat">Colbie Caillat</a>, <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>; and the 1960s acts <a href="The%20Shirelles">The Shirelles</a>, <a href="Doris%20Troy">Doris Troy</a>, and <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused "1989", was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including <a href="Annie%20Lennox">Annie Lennox</a>, <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a> and "<a href="Like%20a%20Prayer%20%28song%29">Like a Prayer</a>-era <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>".

Swift's music contains elements of <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a>, <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a>, and <a href="Country%20music">country</a>. She described herself as a country artist until the 2014 release of "1989", which she described as a "sonically cohesive pop album". "Rolling Stone" wrote: "[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days." According to "The New York Times", "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville". "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that Swift "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".

Swift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" as "sweet, but soft". The "Los Angeles Times" identified Swift's "defining" vocal gesture in studio recordings as "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". "Rolling Stone", in a "Speak Now" review, wrote: "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." In another review of "Speak Now", "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" wrote that her phrasing was previously "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean." "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that her live vocals are "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" described Swift's vocals as "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with <a href="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a>.

In an interview with "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across." A writer for "<a href="The%20Tennessean">The Tennessean</a>" conceded in 2010 that Swift is "not the best technical singer", but described her as the "best communicator that we've got". Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has "put a lot of work" into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons. She has said that she only feels nervous performing "if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".

Swift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the "anonymous crushes of her high school years" and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by "The Village Voice": "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." However, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" believes the media scrutiny over her decision to "mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". Swift said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".

"The Guardian" has praised Swift for writing about teenage years "with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia" over the course of her first two albums. "New York" has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but "none made great records so explicitly about their teens". The magazine has also compared her work to <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a>. In "Fearless", Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect "between fairy tales and the reality of love". Her later albums address more adult relationships. In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships, alienation, fame, and career ambitions. Swift frequently includes "a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative".

"Rolling Stone" describes Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". According to "The Village Voice", she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently. In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In "The Guardian"s words, "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed <a href="trenchfoot">trenchfoot</a>". "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" adds, "to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album". Although reviews of Swift's work are "almost uniformly positive", "The New Yorker" has said she is generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Dylanesque</a> visionary".

Swift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention. In 2013, <a href="Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> marketed a slogan T-shirt with a "<a href="slut-shaming">slut-shaming</a>" remark directed toward her. "The New York Times" asserted that her "dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a "quarter-life crisis". Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public, as she believes that talking about it can be "a career weakness".
"Rolling Stone" remarks upon her polite manner: "If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops."

The Pit and the Pendulum (1961 film)

The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> in <a href="Panavision">Panavision</a> and <a href="Pathe%20Color">Pathe Color</a> directed by <a href="Roger%20Corman">Roger Corman</a>, starring <a href="Vincent%20Price">Vincent Price</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Steele">Barbara Steele</a>, <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28actor%29">John Kerr</a>, and <a href="Luana%20Anders">Luana Anders</a>. The <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> by <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> was loosely inspired by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s 1842 <a href="The%20Pit%20and%20the%20Pendulum">short story of the same name</a>. Set in sixteenth-century Spain, the story is about a young <a href="English%20people">Englishman</a> who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently <a href="ghost">ghost</a>ly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular <a href="torture%20device">torture device</a> by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's <a href="climax%20%28narrative%29">climactic</a> <a href="sequence%20%28film%29">sequence</a>.

The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by <a href="American%20International%20Pictures%23List%20of%20Corman-Poe%20films">American International Pictures</a>, the first having been Corman's " <a href="House%20of%20Usher%20%28film%29">House of Usher</a>" released the previous year. Like "House", the film features <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> by <a href="Floyd%20Crosby">Floyd Crosby</a>, sets designed by <a href="art%20director">art director</a> <a href="Daniel%20Haller">Daniel Haller</a>, and a <a href="film%20score">film score</a> composed by <a href="Les%20Baxter">Les Baxter</a>. A critical and box-office hit, "Pit"'s commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue <a href="film%20adaptation">adapting</a> Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. The series ended in 1965 with the release of "<a href="The%20Tomb%20of%20Ligeia">The Tomb of Ligeia</a>".

<a href="Film%20critic">Film critic</a> <a href="Tim%20Lucas">Tim Lucas</a> and writer <a href="Ernesto%20Gastaldi">Ernesto Gastaldi</a> have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent <a href="Cinema%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> thrillers, from <a href="Mario%20Bava">Mario Bava</a>'s "<a href="The%20Whip%20and%20the%20Body">The Whip and the Body</a>" (1963) to <a href="Dario%20Argento">Dario Argento</a>'s " <a href="Deep%20Red">Deep Red</a> " (1975). <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> has described one of "Pit"'s major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film.

In sixteenth century Spain, Englishman Francis Barnard (John Kerr) visits the castle of his brother-in-law Nicholas Medina (Vincent Price) to investigate the mysterious death of his sister Elizabeth (Barbara Steele). Nicholas and his younger sister Catherine (Luana Anders) offer a vague explanation that Elizabeth died from a rare blood disorder six months earlier; Nicholas is evasive when Francis asks for specific details about the disease. Francis vows that he will not leave until he discovers the true circumstances surrounding his sister's death.

During dinner with the family physician, Dr. Leon (Antony Carbone), Francis again asks about his sister's death. Dr. Leon tells him that his sister died of massive <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>, literally "dying of fright". Francis demands to be shown where Elizabeth died. Nicholas takes him to the castle's <a href="torture%20chamber">torture chamber</a>. Nicholas reveals that Elizabeth, under the influence of the castle's "heavy atmosphere", became obsessed with the chamber's torture devices. After becoming progressively unbalanced, one day she locked herself into an <a href="Iron%20maiden%20%28torture%20device%29">iron maiden</a>, and died after whispering the name "Sebastian". Francis refuses to believe Nicholas's story.

Francis tells Catherine that Nicholas appears to feel "definite guilt" regarding Elizabeth's death. In response, Catherine talks about Nicholas's <a href="psychological%20trauma">traumatic childhood</a>. Their father was Sebastian Medina, a notorious agent of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. When Nicholas was a small child, he was exploring the forbidden torture chamber when his father (also played by Price) entered the room with his mother Isabella and Sebastian's brother, Bartolome. Hiding in a corner, Nicholas watched in horror as his father repeatedly hit Bartolome with a red-hot poker, screaming "Adulterer!" at him. After murdering Bartolome, Sebastian began torturing his wife slowly to death in front of Nicholas.

Catherine and Francis are later informed by Dr. Leon that Isabella in fact was not tortured to death, rather she was entombed behind a brick wall while still alive. Dr. Leon explains, "The very thought of <a href="premature%20burial">premature interment</a> is enough to send your brother into convulsions of horror." Nicholas fears that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely. The doctor tells Nicholas that "if Elizabeth Medina walks these corridors, it is her <a href="spirit">spirit</a> and not her living self."

Nicholas believes that his late wife's <a href="vengeful%20ghost">vengeful ghost</a> is haunting the castle. Elizabeth's room is the source of a loud commotion, and it is found ransacked and her portrait slashed. Her beloved <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a> plays in the middle of the night. One of Elizabeth's rings is found on the keyboard. Francis accuses Nicholas of planting the evidence of Elizabeth's "haunting" as an elaborate hoax. Nicholas insists that his wife's tomb be opened. They discover Elizabeth's <a href="decomposition">putrefied</a> corpse frozen in a position that suggests that she died screaming after failing to claw her way out of her sarcophagus. Nicholas faints.

That night, Nicholas–now on the verge of insanity–hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her ghostly voice down to her tomb. Elizabeth rises from her coffin and pursues Nicholas into the torture chamber, where he falls down a flight of stairs. As Elizabeth gloats over her husband's unconscious body, she is met by her lover and accomplice, Dr. Leon. They had plotted to drive Nicholas mad so that she could inherit his fortune and the castle.

Leon confirms that Nicholas "is gone", his mind destroyed by terror. Elizabeth taunts her insensate husband. Nicholas opens his eyes and begins laughing hysterically while his wife and the doctor recoil in horror. Believing himself to be Sebastian, he replays the events of his mother and uncle's murders. He overpowers Dr. Leon, believing him to be Bartolome, and Leon falls to his death in the pit while trying to escape. Nicholas seizes Elizabeth, and repeats his father's promise to Isabella to torture her horribly.

Francis, having heard Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps him to a stone slab located directly beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum is attached to a clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the <a href="domestic%20worker">servants</a>. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.

20th Century Fox had announced plans to film the story in the late '50s, along with versions of "<a href="The%20Tell-Tale%20Heart">The Tell-Tale Heart</a>" and "<a href="The%20Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>", but the films were never made.

When Roger Corman's "House of Usher" was released in June 1960, its box office success took AIP's James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff by surprise. Corman admitted, "We anticipated that the movie would do well... but not half as well as it did." According to Richard Matheson, "When the first film was a hit, they still didn't consider doing a Poe series. They just wanted another movie with a Poe title fixed to it."

Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after "Usher" were "The Masque of the Red Death", and '"Pit and the Pendulum". He considered making the former but was worried about similarities between the story and "<a href="The%20Seventh%20Seal">The Seventh Seal</a>" (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However <a href="Samuel%20Z.%20Arkoff">Samuel Z. Arkoff</a> said it was his and <a href="James%20H.%20Nicholson">James H. Nicholson</a>'s decision to make "Pit" as the second Poe film "because it was a lot more graphic and in the second place, "Masque of the Red Death" would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so when we did finally make "Masque of the Red Death" we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it."

Matheson's script freely devised an elaborate <a href="narrative">narrative</a> that barely resembled Poe, with only the finale having any similarity at all to the original short story on which the film was based. Corman noted, "The method we adopted on "The Pit and the Pendulum" was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third <a href="act%20%28theater%29">act</a> to the motion picture... because a two-page short story is not about to give you a ninety-minute motion picture. We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen."

Matheson's screenplay included a <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> to a time immediately preceding Elizabeth's illness, featuring Nicholas and Elizabeth horseback-riding and eating a picnic lunch. Corman deleted the sequence prior to filming because he felt it violated one of his major theories regarding the Poe series:
I had a lot of theories I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the <a href="unconscious%20mind">unconscious mind</a> of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until "<a href="The%20Tomb%20of%20Ligeia">The Tomb of Ligeia</a>", we never showed the real world. In "Pit", John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.
The screenplay was modified from its original draft form during the film's shooting. Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. Don Medina responds: "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. ("turning") What brings you to us?" Price penciled in the suggestions "that must be kept in constant repair" and "that cannot be stopped". Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. During Nicholas' death scene, after falling to the bottom of the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, "Elizabeth. What have I done to you? ("beat") What have I done to you?" The camera was to then <a href="Cut%20%28transition%29">cut</a> directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.

"The Pit and the Pendulum" was announced in August 1960, and filming began the first week of January 1961.

According to Lucy Chase Williams' book, "The Complete Films of Vincent Price", the shooting schedule was fifteen days, and the film's budget was almost $1 million. Corman himself has said that the film's actual production cost was approximately $300,000.

Corman has noted that making the film was a pleasurable experience: "I enjoyed "The Pit and the Pendulum" because I actually got the chance to experiment a bit with the movement of the camera. There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting <a href="film%20editing">cutting</a> in the climax of the film."

Filming went smoothly, and Corman attributed the ease of the production's shoot to the short but comprehensive <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a> planning he did with the major technicians:
We achieved what we did on a low budget because we carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras. Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with <a href="Cinematographer">director of photography</a> Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set.

To create the flashbacks revealing Nicholas' <a href="Psychological%20trauma">traumatic experiences</a>, Corman and Crosby attempted to shoot them in a manner that would convey to the audience the character's horror in dredging up nightmares trapped in his <a href="unconscious%20mind">subconscious</a>. Corman insisted on these images having a <a href="dream">dream-like</a> quality, "twisted and distorted because they were being experienced by someone on the rim of madness". Corman decided to film the flashbacks in <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a>, since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in "black-and white" imagery. Crosby used <a href="wide-angle%20lens">wide-angle lens</a>es, violent camera movement, and tilted <a href="camera%20angle">camera angle</a>s to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on <a href="film%20tinting">blue-tinted</a> <a href="film%20stock">stock</a> which was subsequently toned red during <a href="photographic%20processing">development</a>, effectively producing a <a href="wikt%3Atwo-tone">two-tone</a> image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red...producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an <a href="optical%20printer">optical printer</a> where the edges were <a href="vignetting">vignetted</a> and a twisted linear distortion was introduced.

The film's brief exterior <a href="prologue">prologue</a> showing Kerr's arrival to the castle was filmed on the <a href="Palos%20Verdes">Palos Verdes</a> coast. The rest of the production was shot in four interior <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s at the California Studios in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. To provide great freedom for the planned camera movements, a castle set with many levels and ample space was designed by Daniel Haller.

Because of the film's low budget, none of the sets could be constructed "from scratch." After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the <a href="backlot">backlot</a>s and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>, he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props. At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone wall units. Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible. To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of cobwebbing was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.

The film's <a href="pressbook">pressbook</a> noted that the pendulum was eighteen-feet long and weighed over a ton and was constructed with a realistic rubber cutting blade. The pendulum was rigged from the top of the sound stage thirty-five feet in the air. In an interview, Haller provided details regarding the creation of the pendulum:
I found that such a pendulum actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. The problem was to get it in exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.
To visually enhance the size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40 mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted at the opposite end of the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in <a href="matte%20painting">process extensions</a> of the set, doubling its size onscreen.


Prior to the start of filming, Corman had set aside one day of <a href="rehearsal">rehearsal</a>s with his cast. "Previously, I had painstakingly rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is nothing worse than to be on the set and ready to roll, only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions."

"The Pit and the Pendulum" was a bigger financial hit than "House of Usher", accruing over US$2,000,000 in <a href="film%20distributor">distributors'</a> domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals versus the first film's US$1,450,000. This made it the most successful film to date in AIP's history.

The movie would remain the most financially successful of all the AIP Poe films. "It's also the one I liked the best because it was the scariest," said Arkoff. "We had a wonderful piece of artwork for the poster... as well as some great sets by Danny Haller."

According to writer <a href="Ed%20Naha">Ed Naha</a>, the film also received a better critical response than "Usher". The majority of the film's reviews were positive.

<a href="Howard%20Thompson%20%28film%20critic%29">Howard Thompson</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote, "Atmospherically at least—there is a striking fusion of rich colors, plush décor and eerie music—this is probably Hollywood's most effective Poe-style horror flavoring to date…Richard Matheson's ironic plot is compact and as logical as the choice of the small cast…Roger Corman has evoked a genuinely chilling mood of horror." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" noted, "The last portion of the film builds with genuine excitement to a reverse-<a href="twist%20ending">twist ending</a> that might have pleased Poe himself...a physically stylish, imaginatively photographed horror film…" The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Herald-Examiner">Los Angeles Examiner</a>" said it was "…one of the best "scare" movies to come along in a long time…skillfully directed by Corman…with Vincent Price turning in the acting job of his career…." <a href="Brendan%20Gill">Brendan Gill</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" felt it was "a thoroughly creepy sequence of horrors..." "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" called the film "a literary hair-raiser that is cleverly, if self-consciously, Edgar Allan poetic." "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" described it as "...a class suspense/horror film of the calibre of the excellent ones done by <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer</a>...It is carefully made and has full production values...Vincent Price gives a characteristically <a href="rococo">rococo</a> performance..."

"<a href="The%20Monthly%20Film%20Bulletin">The Monthly Film Bulletin</a>" was negative, writing that the production values "cannot prevent a strong impression of "déjà vu"," and that Kerr, Anders and Carbone were all "glumly wooden" in their performances. Charles Stinson of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" was notably unimpressed by the film: "The uncredited scenario violates Poe's gothic style with passages of flat, modernized dialogue…But the <a href="wiktionary%3Apeccadillo">pecadilloes</a> of the script pale beside the acting…Price mugs, rolls his eyes continuously, and delivers his lines in such an unctuous tone that he comes near to <a href="burlesque">burlesquing</a> the role. His mad scenes are just ludicrous. The audience almost died laughing."
Price was so infuriated by Stinson's negative review that he wrote a letter to the critic, saying, "I find I must break a 25-year determination never to answer a critic. Since your review of "The Pit and the Pendulum" was obviously not meant to be instructive, and therefore constructive, but only to hurt and humiliate, I'm sure you would enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that it did. My only consolation…is that it is the second-greatest box-office attraction in the country."
Price apparently never sent the letter, placing it instead into his "Letting Off Steam File".

The film's critical reputation has continued to grow over the years, and it is now generally held to be one of the best entries in Corman's Poe series. "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" has opined, "Corman at his intoxicating best, drawing a seductive mesh of sexual motifs from Poe's story through a fine Richard Matheson script." In "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Horror%20and%20the%20Supernatural">The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural</a>", Timothy Sullivan wrote:
""The Pit and the Pendulum" is even better than its predecessor…The plot is heady stuff, and Roger Corman drives it forward—with wonderful <a href="matte%20painting">matte shots</a> of the castle perched on the seaside cliff, odd camera angles, the thickest cobwebs in horror-movie history, a spider in the face, and an iron maiden—all before our hero is strapped under the pendulum...in a sequence that still stands one's hair on end."
<a href="Phil%20Hardy%20%28journalist%29">Phil Hardy</a>'s "<a href="The%20Aurum%20Film%20Encyclopedia">The Aurum Film Encyclopedia</a>: Horror" observed:
"If Price's performance is noticeably more extravagant than in the earlier film, this is offset (or matched) by the markedly greater fluidity of camera movement. "House of Usher" seemed unsure of how to cope with the rush of action as Madeline returned from the grave; "The Pit and the Pendulum" has no such hesitations. From the great sequence in which Steele lures Price down into the crypt to the finale…its action is terrific."
<a href="Tim%20Lucas">Tim Lucas</a>, in reviewing the film's <a href="DVD">DVD</a> release in 2001, wrote, "Benefitting from the box-office success of "House of Usher", "Pit" is a more elaborate production and features some of the definitive moments of the AIP Corman/Poe series." And <a href="Glenn%20Erickson">Glenn Erickson</a>, reviewing the DVD on his "DVD Savant" website, noted, "Roger Corman's second Edgar Allan Poe adaptation is a big improvement on his first, "House of Usher"… Remembered as a first-rate chiller by every kid who saw it, "Pit and the Pendulum" upped the ante for frantic action and potential grue…"

Recent critical opinion of the film is not all positive. Of the 17 reviews included in a <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> survey of critics regarding the title, 17% reflect negative reactions. FilmCritic.com opines that the film "...is quite a disappointment...In the end, it feels like one of [Corman's] rush jobs, which of course, it was."

The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the <a href="2016%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2016 Cannes Film Festival</a>.

The critical and popular success of "The Pit and the Pendulum" persuaded AIP's Arkoff and Nicholson to produce more Edgar Allan Poe-based horror films on a regular basis. The films that followed, all directed by Corman, were "<a href="The%20Premature%20Burial%20%28film%29">The Premature Burial</a>" (1962), "<a href="Tales%20of%20Terror%20%281962%20film%29">Tales of Terror</a>" (1962), "<a href="The%20Raven%20%281963%20film%29">The Raven</a>" (1963), "<a href="The%20Haunted%20Palace">The Haunted Palace</a>" (1963, actually based on the novella "<a href="The%20Case%20of%20Charles%20Dexter%20Ward">The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</a>" by <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>), "<a href="The%20Masque%20of%20the%20Red%20Death%20%281964%20film%29">The Masque of the Red Death</a>" (1964), and" <a href="The%20Tomb%20of%20Ligeia">The Tomb of Ligeia</a>" (1965).

Tim Lucas has argued that the film had a large impact on many <a href="Cinema%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> horror films that followed. Lucas noted, "It takes Corman's <a href="Freudian">Freudian</a> theories even further with a nightmarish flashback sequence that plants the seeds of Nicholas's breakdown, and would prove particularly influential on the future course of Italian horror — an influence that can be seen even in productions of the 1970s ("<a href="Deep%20Red">Deep Red</a>") and 1980s ("<a href="A%20Blade%20in%20the%20Dark">A Blade in the Dark</a>")." 
Writer K. Lindbergs has noted an "obvious influence" on <a href="Antonio%20Margheriti">Antonio Margheriti</a>'s "<a href="Castle%20of%20Blood">Castle of Blood</a>" (1964) and its <a href="remake">remake</a>, "<a href="Web%20of%20the%20Spider">Web of the Spider</a>" (1970).

Screenwriter <a href="Ernesto%20Gastaldi">Ernesto Gastaldi</a> acknowledged that Ugo Guerra and Elio Scardamaglia, the producers of <a href="Mario%20Bava">Mario Bava</a>'s "<a href="The%20Whip%20and%20the%20Body">The Whip and the Body</a>" (1963), had "shown me an Italian print of "The Pit and the Pendulum" before I started writing it: 'Give us something like this', they said." When asked if another of his films, "<a href="The%20Long%20Hair%20of%20Death">The Long Hair of Death</a>" (1964), was inspired by Corman's film, Gastaldi replied, "Yes, of course! "The Pit and the Pendulum" had a big influence on Italian horror films. Everybody borrowed from it."

Stephen King felt that one of the film's most powerful shocks—the discovery of Elizabeth's hideously decayed corpse—had a major impact on the genre and served as one of the most significant horror sequences of the decade. King wrote, "Following the <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer</a> films, this becomes, I think, the most important moment in the post-1960 horror film, signaling a return to an all-out effort to terrify the audience...and a willingness to use any means at hand to do it."

In 1968, when the film was sold to <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC-TV</a> for television airings, the network noted that the film was too short to fill the desired two-hour time slot. They requested that AIP extend the film's runtime. Approximately five minutes of additional footage were subsequently shot by Corman's <a href="production%20assistant">production assistant</a> <a href="Tamara%20Asseyev">Tamara Asseyev</a>.

Of the original cast members, only Luana Anders was available at the time, and the new sequence featured her character, Catherine Medina, confined to a <a href="Psychiatric%20hospital">lunatic asylum</a>. After much screaming and hair pulling, Catherine reveals the details of her horrific story to her fellow inmates, at which point the film itself follows as a flashback.

Banksia petiolaris

Banksia petiolaris is a species of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, where it is found in sandy soils in the south coastal regions from <a href="Munglinup">Munglinup</a> east to <a href="Israelite%20Bay">Israelite Bay</a>. It was first described by <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> state botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> in 1864, and no subspecies are recognised. "B. petiolaris" is one of several closely related species that all grow as <a href="prostrate%20shrub">prostrate shrub</a>, with horizontal stems and thick, leathery upright leaves. Those of this species can be viable for up to 13 years—the longest-lived of any flowering plant recorded. It bears yellow cylindrical flower spikes, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, up to high in spring. As the spikes age, they turn grey and develop up to 20 woody seed pods, known as <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, each.

Insects such as bees, wasps and ants pollinate the flowers. "B. petiolaris" is nonlignotuberous, meaning that it regenerates by seed after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>. "B. petiolaris" adapts readily to cultivation, growing in well-drained sandy soils in sunny locations. It is suitable for <a href="Rock%20garden">rockeries</a> and as a <a href="groundcover">groundcover</a>.

"Banksia petiolaris" is a <a href="prostrate%20shrub">prostrate shrub</a> that can spread to a diameter of . Its thick stems grow horizontally on the ground and are covered in fine hair. The new growth is more densely covered with velvety orange brown hair. The large, leathery, upright leaves arise vertically on <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a> up to high. The upper surface faces north and is inclined at around 15 degrees off vertical. The leaf blades can reach in length and wide. They are dull green with serrated margins and a white undersurface. Dead leaves remain on the plant. Flowering occurs in late spring. The cylindrical <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s are yellow in overall colour and range from high. As the flower spikes age, they fade to a greyish colour, the old flowers persisting. Up to 20 woody seed pods, known as <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a>, may appear on each spike. Covered with a fine grey fur, they are elliptical in shape and measure in length, and in width.

The <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped) seed is long and fairly flattened. It is composed of the triangular seed body (containing the <a href="Plant%20embryogenesis">embryonic</a> plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23W">wing</a>. One side, designated the "outer surface", is deeply pitted and the other is brown and smooth. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a> that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. The first pair of leaves produced by seedlings, known as <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s, are cuneate (wedge-shaped) and measure long by wide. They are dull-green with a faint net-like pattern. The <a href="auricle%20%28botany%29">auricle</a> at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The first pair of leaves to appear after the cotyledons are long and oval in shape, with 2–3 lobes or teeth on each side. The next set are long with 7–10 teeth.

"B. petiolaris" is fairly uniform across its range, though plants may vary in leaf size. Its yellow flower spikes and white leaf undersurface distinguish it from other prostrate banksias.

"Banksia petiolaris" was first described by Victorian state botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> in 1864, its <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific name</a> <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "with petioles", referring to the species' long petioles. The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was most likely collected in 1861 by G. Maxwell between <a href="Cape%20Le%20Grand%20National%20Park">Cape Le Grand</a> and <a href="Cape%20Arid%20National%20Park">Cape Arid</a> and is housed in Melbourne. <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published a thorough revision of "Banksia" in his landmark publication "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870. In <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his arrangement</a>, Bentham defined four <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a> based on leaf, <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style">style</a> and pollen-presenter characteristics. "B. petiolaris" was placed in section <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Cyrtostylis">"Cyrtostylis"</a>, a group of species which did not fit easily into one of the other sections. No further subspecies or varieties of "B. petiolaris" have been described, and it has no <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a>s. Its only <a href="nomenclatural%20synonym">nomenclatural synonym</a> is "Sirmuellera petiolaris" , which arose from <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>'s unsuccessful 1891 attempt to transfer "Banksia" into the new name "Sirmuellera".

In his 1981 <a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">monograph</a> on the genus, Australian botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> placed "B. petiolaris" in <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subgenus "Banksia"</a> because its inflorescence is a typical "Banksia" flower spike shape, in <a href="Banksia%20sect.%20Banksia">"B." section "Banksia"</a> because of its straight styles, and <a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Prostratae">"Banksia" series "Prostratae"</a>, because of its prostrate habit, along with five other closely related species. George held it to be most closely related to "<a href="Banksia%20blechnifolia">B. blechnifolia</a>".

In 1996, botanists <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> published an arrangement informed by a <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characteristics. <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">Their arrangement</a> maintained "B. petiolaris" in "B." subg. "Banksia" and series Prostratae. They found it to be basal (the earliest offshoot) to the other prostrate banksias. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. The placement of "B. petiolaris" in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a> may be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Banksiinae">Banksiinae</a>, which includes "Banksia". With respect to "B. petiolaris", Mast's results have some semblance to George and Thiele's. It is somewhat basal in a group with the other prostrate species as well as species in series "Tetragonae", and "<a href="Banksia%20elderiana">B. elderiana</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20baueri">B. baueri</a>", and "<a href="Banksia%20lullfitzii">B. lullfitzii</a>". However, "B. repens", "B. chamaephyton" and "B. blechnifolia" form a closely knit group within this group, and the overall inferred <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksiinae" by publishing several new names, including subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"Spathulatae"</a> for the species of "Banksia" that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">"B." subgenus "Banksia"</a>. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. petiolaris" is placed in subgenus "Banksia". In a 2013 cladistics study, evolutionary scientists Marcell Cardillo and Renae Pratt found that its closest relative is "<a href="Banksia%20brevidentata">B. brevidentata</a>".

<a href="endemism">Endemic</a> to Western Australia, "Banksia petiolaris" is found near the state's south coast from the vicinity of <a href="Munglinup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Munglinup</a> east to <a href="Israelite%20Bay">Israelite Bay</a>, concentrated in two disjunct ranges – an eastern one around <a href="Cape%20Arid%20National%20Park">Cape Arid National Park</a>, and western one east of <a href="Scaddan%2C%20Western%20Australia">Scaddan</a>. It is found in white sandy soils in <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> or <a href="Mallee%20%28habit%29">mallee</a> <a href="heath">heath</a>land, but sometimes occurs with the taller "<a href="Banksia%20speciosa">B. speciosa</a>". It is often locally common, with many populations over 100 plants in size.

Like many plants in Australia's southwest, "Banksia petiolaris" is adapted to an environment in which <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> events are relatively frequent. Most "Banksia" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: "reseeders" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">canopy seed bank</a>, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; "<a href="resprouter">resprouter</a>s" survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> protected by thick bark. "B. petiolaris" and the related "B. blechnifolia" are in the former category—rapid growing plants killed by bushfire and regenerating by <a href="seed">seed</a>—while the other prostrate species are slow growing resprouters.

Like other banksias, "B. petiolaris" plays host to a variety of pollinators—insects such as bees, wasps and ants were all recorded in the 1988 "<a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a>" survey.

An assessment of the potential impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change. Many of its western populations are found on road verges, rendering them vulnerable to resurfacing or widening of roadways. It does, however, show little susceptibility to the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", unlike many Western Australian banksias.

"Banksia petiolaris" has the longest-lived leaves of any <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> so far recorded – a study published in 1992 recorded a lifespan of up to 13 years for a single leaf, while leaves of 10 years of age ably maintained their ability to <a href="Photosynthesis">photosynthesize</a> compared with young leaves. The authors concluded that leaf longevity is advantageous in plants in nutrient-poor soils, as the loss of valuable nutrients in leaf loss is minimised (the leaves store much of a plants' nutrients).

"B. petiolaris" is grown fairly commonly in Australian gardens, making an attractive prostrate groundcover or <a href="rockery">rockery</a> plant. It can also be grown on embankments to reduce soil erosion. Although somewhat resistant to <a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">dieback</a>, it does require a well drained soil, preferably fairly sandy. Like other banksias, it grows best in full sun. It is tolerant of <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> soils, with one cultivated specimen recorded tolerating a pH of 9.5. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take about 18 to 49 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>.

Written by series creator <a href="Josh%20Schwartz">Josh Schwartz</a> and directed by executive producer <a href="Doug%20Liman">Doug Liman</a>, the episode depicts the introduction of troubled teenager <a href="Ryan%20Atwood">Ryan Atwood</a> (<a href="Benjamin%20McKenzie">Benjamin McKenzie</a>) into the wealthy lifestyle of the Cohen family in <a href="Newport%20Beach%2C%20California">Newport Beach</a>, <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a>, <a href="California">California</a>.

The casting directors, Patrick J. Rush and Alyson Silverberg, began selecting the principal cast eight to ten weeks before filming started. The role of Ryan was particularly hard to cast. <a href="Seth%20Cohen">Seth Cohen</a> (<a href="Adam%20Brody">Adam Brody</a>) was based on Schwartz's experiences at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> as a "neurotic Jewish kid from the East Coast in a land of water polo players". Other central characters in the episode are Seth's parents—<a href="Sandy%20Cohen">Sandy</a> (<a href="Peter%20Gallagher">Peter Gallagher</a>) and <a href="Kirsten%20Cohen">Kirsten</a> (<a href="Kelly%20Rowan">Kelly Rowan</a>)—and teenage next-door neighbor <a href="Marissa%20Cooper">Marissa Cooper</a> (<a href="Mischa%20Barton">Mischa Barton</a>).

The series premiere led the first half-hour of its time slot in <a href="audience%20measurement">viewership</a>. It was generally well received by critics, and earned Schwartz a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> nomination for <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay%20-%20Episodic%20Drama">Best Screenplay in an Episodic Drama</a>. Rush and Silverberg received an <a href="Artios%20Award">Artios Award</a> nomination for excellence of casting in the Dramatic Pilot category. Originally broadcast and released in a , it was remastered in a ratio for the series DVD, released in November 2007. The episode was released on <a href="MiniDVD">MiniDVD</a> on April 26, 2005, and is available to purchase from <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> services.

A <a href="cold%20open">cold open</a> shows <a href="Trey%20Atwood">Trey Atwood</a> (<a href="Bradley%20Stryker">Bradley Stryker</a>) and his brother Ryan stealing a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in <a href="juvenile%20hall">juvenile hall</a> for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his <a href="public%20defender">public defender</a>, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart boy with a rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his <a href="SAT%20I">SAT I</a> scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, <a href="Dawn%20Atwood">Dawn</a> (<a href="Daphne%20Ashbrook">Daphne Ashbrook</a>), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in <a href="Chino%2C%20California">Chino</a>, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with nowhere to go, Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in <a href="Newport%20Beach%2C%20California">Newport Beach</a>, the <a href="opening%20credits">opening credits</a> and the <a href="California%20%28Phantom%20Planet%20song%29">theme tune</a> play—unlike the other episodes, there is no <a href="title%20sequence">title sequence</a>.

While Sandy tries to convince his wife, Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) to allow Ryan to stay in the pool house for a night, Ryan meets the girl next door, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton). When her boyfriend <a href="Luke%20Ward">Luke</a> (<a href="Chris%20Carmack">Chris Carmack</a>) picks her up, Marissa invites Ryan to attend a fashion show fundraiser the following night. On a sailing trip the next day, the Cohens' son, Seth (Adam Brody) reveals to Ryan that he has a crush on <a href="Summer%20Roberts">Summer</a> (<a href="Rachel%20Bilson">Rachel Bilson</a>) and would like to sail to <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> with her, but that she never pays him any attention. Later, Marissa leaves for the fashion show with her mother <a href="Julie%20Cooper%20%28The%20O.C.%29">Julie</a> (<a href="Melinda%20Clarke">Melinda Clarke</a>), her father <a href="Jimmy%20Cooper%20%28The%20O.C.%29">Jimmy</a> (<a href="Tate%20Donovan">Tate Donovan</a>), and her younger sister <a href="Kaitlin%20Cooper">Kaitlin</a> (<a href="Shailene%20Woodley">Shailene Woodley</a>). The Cohens and Ryan also attend the show.

Summer invites Ryan to a party after the show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join him. For the first time, Seth is introduced to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness of a party for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks down the beach, and is bullied by a group of water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; he carries her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves. Sandy drives Ryan back to Chino, but when they find his home empty, they return to Newport.

In 2002, Schwartz met with <a href="McG">Joseph "McG" McGinty Nichol</a> and <a href="Stephanie%20Savage">Stephanie Savage</a> of production company <a href="Wonderland%20Sound%20and%20Vision">Wonderland Sound and Vision</a>. They told Schwartz they wanted to create a television show based in McG's hometown of <a href="Newport%20Beach%2C%20California">Newport Beach</a>. Savage suggested producing a police or extreme sports "<a href="21%20Jump%20Street">21 Jump Street</a>"-style show, but Schwartz knew little about the genre. Having had experience with people from Newport Beach during his time at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, Schwartz came back to them with his own characters. The show was pitched to Fox and <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros</a> in August 2002. Fox targeted a summer launch for the show, and <a href="Doug%20Liman">Doug Liman</a> was brought in to direct the premiere after McG withdrew due his scheduling conflicts with "<a href="Charlie%27s%20Angels%202">Charlie's Angels 2</a>". The show was confirmed for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">2003–2004 schedule</a> in May, and an August 5, 2003 broadcast date was selected in June.

Casting directors Patrick J. Rush and Alyson Silverberg began casting the main roles eight to ten weeks before filming began, with input from Schwartz, McG and Savage. Rush and Silverberg were later nominated in the Dramatic Pilot category of the <a href="Casting%20Society%20of%20America">Casting Society of America</a>'s <a href="Artios%20Awards">Artios Awards</a>.

In February 2003, <a href="Peter%20Gallagher">Peter Gallagher</a> became the first actor cast, playing <a href="Sandy%20Cohen">Sandy Cohen</a>. <a href="Kelly%20Rowan">Kelly Rowan</a> auditioned five times before being cast as Sandy's wife, <a href="Kirsten%20Cohen">Kirsten</a>, in March 2003. Rush found the role of Ryan Atwood particularly hard to cast, as the producers wanted the "perfect" actor. <a href="Benjamin%20McKenzie">Benjamin McKenzie</a> was only invited to audition for the role after <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> made them aware of the actor following his unsuccessful audition for a <a href="UPN">UPN</a> sitcom. McKenzie joined the cast in March 2003. He lacked working experience and later described his selection as "a tremendous leap of faith" on the producers' part. The role of <a href="Seth%20Cohen">Seth Cohen</a> was derived from Schwartz's experiences at the University of Southern California as a "neurotic Jewish kid from the East Coast in a land of water polo players". <a href="Adam%20Brody">Adam Brody</a> first read for the part of Ryan, but found the bad-boy image did not suit him. In a recall for the role of Seth, Brody lost the producers' interest by <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad-libbing</a> much of the script; he joined the cast in March 2003 after a second interview.

<a href="Mischa%20Barton">Mischa Barton</a>, who had met McG on "<a href="Fastlane%20%28TV%20series%29">Fastlane</a>", portrayed <a href="Marissa%20Cooper">Marissa Cooper</a>. She was cast in February 2003. <a href="Tate%20Donovan">Tate Donovan</a>, who played <a href="Jimmy%20Cooper%20%28The%20O.C.%29">Jimmy Cooper</a>, was cast in March 2003. <a href="Melinda%20Clarke">Melinda Clarke</a> guest-starred as <a href="Julie%20Cooper%20%28The%20O.C.%29">Julie Cooper</a>, but read for the role of Kirsten in her audition as there were not enough scripted lines for Julie at the time. <a href="Rachel%20Bilson">Rachel Bilson</a>, who was recommended to Schwartz after an unsuccessful audition for "<a href="Everwood">Everwood</a>", guest-starred as <a href="Summer%20Roberts">Summer Roberts</a>, whom the producers had envisaged as a tall Californian blonde. Clarke and Bilson joined as regular cast members later in the season. <a href="Chris%20Carmack">Chris Carmack</a>, who played <a href="Luke%20Ward">Luke Ward</a>, was credited as a guest star for the episode; he joined the regular cast in the next episode.

Although the show is set in Newport Beach, financial penalties imposed for filming outside the "<a href="Thirty%20Mile%20Zone">Thirty Mile Zone</a>" forced production to the <a href="Manhattan%20Beach%2C%20California">Manhattan Beach</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles County</a> region. The scenes set in Ryan's hometown of <a href="Chino%2C%20California">Chino</a> were filmed in Los Angeles. The show was predominantly shot on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm</a> <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a>. Unusually for the show, a scene in the Atwood home in Chino was shot using a <a href="hand-held%20camera">hand-held camera</a> by Liman. Savage said this ensured the show "doesn't feel like glossy soap opera".

The Cohen family home was shot on location in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu</a>. A mock pool house was built for use in the pilot, and taken down after filming completed. The Cohen's home was recreated on a soundstage at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach for filming during the rest of the series; external shots of the house remained in use. The fashion show was filmed at the <a href="Wilshire%20Ebell%20Theatre">Wilshire Ebell Theatre</a>; though it did not advance the story, Schwartz described it as necessary to show the world in which the characters lived. The party at Holly's beach house following the fashion show was filmed at a beach house in Malibu over three consecutive nights.

The episode premiered at 9:00 p.m. (<a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a>) on August 5, 2003 on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>, and was <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a> in Canada on <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a>. Fox gave the show an early summer premiere to try to establish an audience before the network switched to coverage of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox%23Postseason%20coverage">post-season baseball</a> in October, and ahead of "the clutter of the <a href="Fall%20schedule">fall preview weeks</a>". In the United Kingdom, the episode first aired at 9:00 p.m. (<a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a>) on March 7, 2004 on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, and in Australia on the <a href="Nine%20Network">Nine Network</a>. The episode was released on <a href="MiniDVD">MiniDVD</a> on April 26, 2005, after release plans with other Warner Bros. titles for March were discarded. Although the premiere was originally broadcast and released in a , it was remastered in a ratio for the Region 1 <a href="The%20O.C.%23Media%20releases">complete series DVD</a> release. The Region 2 release retained the original aspect ratio. The episode is available on <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> service <a href="Amazon%20Unbox">Amazon Unbox</a> in the United States, and from the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> in the United States and United Kingdom.

The pilot episode attracted 7.46 million viewers in the United States, second in its time slot behind the season finale of "<a href="Last%20Comic%20Standing">Last Comic Standing</a>". "The O.C." received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">rating/share</a> of 6.8/11 in the first half-hour, ranking first between 9 and 9:30 p.m., but lost the lead in the second half-hour with a rating of 6.7/10. The episode received the highest rating of the night in the 12- to 17-year-old demographic, but in its target audience demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds, it received a less-than-expected Nielsen Rating of 2.9/8. The show built on the audience of lead-in show "<a href="American%20Juniors">American Juniors</a>", and Fox said that they were "fairly happy with the show's performance". Schwartz received a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> nomination for <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay%20-%20Episodic%20Drama">Best Screenplay in an Episodic Drama</a>, with casting directors Rush and Silverberg nominated in the Dramatic Pilot category of the <a href="Artios%20Awards">Artios Awards</a>. The episode was criticized by <a href="City%20Manager">City Manager</a> Glen Rojas for its "negative portrayal" of Chino.

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"'s Carina Chocano praised "The O.C." for being different, claiming that it was "refreshingly free of both [Aaron] <a href="Aaron%20Spelling">Spelling</a>-style camp and the twee earnestness that has characterized more recent teen dramas". Robert Bianco of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" drew comparisons with the successful <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> show "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%2090210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a>", saying that ""The O.C." is better-written and better-acted by a cast that just might be, incredibly enough, even better-looking". He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness as well as the show's ability to "come up with a few smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." <a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a> of the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" felt that "[Benjamin] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters "so detestable and yet bland" that it made the show "almost painful" to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had "positive attributes" that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" commented that "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" and that Barton "does a nice job with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits". Tim Goodman of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" called the episode "superb" and described McKenzie as "essentially playing <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a>". He compared the actor to <a href="Russell%20Crowe">Russell Crowe</a> and noted that McKenzie "pull[ed] the whole thing off with aplomb".

Luke's line, "Welcome to the O.C., bitch", which he says after beating up Ryan, became a <a href="tagline">tagline</a> for the show. <a href="TV%20Land">TV Land</a> placed the line as 83rd in its "100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases" in 2006. Hadley Freeman of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" noted that the teen-focused show made many cultural references due to a "renewed interest in the teen market", adding that the use of cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, "Do you like my hair this straight or is it too <a href="Avril%20Lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>?", while another mother complains, "What are you doing putting my daughter in <a href="Calvin%20Klein">Calvin Klein</a>? She was supposed to be in <a href="Vera%20Wang">Vera Wang</a>!" Teenage misfit Seth complains that "Every day's a fashion show for these kids".

The episode generated interest in the program's music and was regarded as "the show to be heard on". Michael Peck from "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" said that he received a large quantity of mail that inquired about the song "<a href="Into%20Dust">Into Dust</a>" by <a href="Mazzy%20Star">Mazzy Star</a>, which played when Ryan carried Marissa into his bedroom. Other featured music was <a href="The%20All-American%20Rejects">The All-American Rejects</a>' 2003 hit, "<a href="Swing%2C%20Swing">Swing, Swing</a>", and "Hands Up" by <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a> from their 2003 multi-platinum album, "<a href="Elephunk">Elephunk</a>". Among Schwartz's favorite musical moments from the show was <a href="Joseph%20Arthur">Joseph Arthur</a>'s "<a href="Honey%20and%20the%20Moon">Honey and the Moon</a>", which Schwartz claimed helped him write the pilot. The title track "<a href="California%20%28Phantom%20Planet%20song%29">California</a>" introduced the band <a href="Phantom%20Planet">Phantom Planet</a> into the mainstream.

Enzyme inhibitor

An enzyme inhibitor is a <a href="molecule">molecule</a> that binds to an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> and decreases its <a href="enzyme%20activity">activity</a>. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> or correct a <a href="metabolism">metabolic</a> imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. They are also used in <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; "<a href="enzyme%20activator">enzyme activator</a>s" bind to enzymes and increase their <a href="enzyme%20assay">enzymatic activity</a>, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.

The binding of an inhibitor can stop a <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a> from entering the enzyme's <a href="active%20site">active site</a> and/or hinder the enzyme from <a href="catalysis">catalyzing</a> its reaction. Inhibitor binding is either <a href="reversible%20reaction">reversible</a> or irreversible. Irreversible inhibitors usually react with the enzyme and change it chemically (e.g. via <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a> formation). These inhibitors modify key <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> residues needed for enzymatic activity. In contrast, reversible inhibitors bind <a href="non-covalent%20interactions">non-covalently</a> and different types of inhibition are produced depending on whether these inhibitors bind to the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both.

Many <a href="medication">drug molecules</a> are enzyme inhibitors, so their discovery and improvement is an active area of research in <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> and <a href="pharmacology">pharmacology</a>. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its <a href="specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a> (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its <a href="dissociation%20constant">dissociation constant</a>, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few <a href="adverse%20drug%20reaction">side effects</a> and thus low <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a>.

Enzyme inhibitors also occur naturally and are involved in the regulation of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. For example, enzymes in a <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a> can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback</a> slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a> in a <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are <a href="protein">protein</a>s that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like <a href="protease">protease</a>s or <a href="nuclease">nuclease</a>s. A well-characterised example of this is the <a href="ribonuclease%20inhibitor">ribonuclease inhibitor</a>, which binds to <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a>s in one of the tightest known <a href="protein-protein%20interaction">protein–protein interaction</a>s. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.

Reversible inhibitors attach to enzymes with non-covalent interactions such as <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, <a href="hydrophobic%20interaction">hydrophobic interaction</a>s and <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic bond</a>s. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a>s and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.

There are four kinds of reversible enzyme inhibitors. They are classified according to the effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme's substrate on the inhibitor.


Reversible inhibition can be described quantitatively in terms of the inhibitor's <a href="dissociation%20constant">binding</a> to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the <a href="enzyme%20kinetics">kinetic constants</a> of the enzyme. In the classic <a href="Michaelis-Menten%20kinetics">Michaelis-Menten scheme</a> below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the <a href="dissociation%20constant">dissociation constant</a>s "K" or "K"', respectively.

When an enzyme has multiple substrates, inhibitors can show different types of inhibition depending on which substrate is considered. This results from the active site containing two different binding sites within the active site, one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second binding site.

As noted above, an enzyme inhibitor is characterised by its two <a href="dissociation%20constant">dissociation constant</a>s, "K" and "K"', to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, respectively. The enzyme-inhibitor constant "K" can be measured directly by various methods; one extremely accurate method is <a href="Isothermal%20Titration%20Calorimetry">isothermal titration calorimetry</a>, in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured. However, the other dissociation constant "K"' is difficult to measure directly, since the enzyme-substrate complex is short-lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product. Hence, "K"' is usually measured indirectly, by observing the <a href="enzyme%20activity">enzyme activity</a> under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and <a href="nonlinear%20regression">fitting</a> the data to a modified <a href="enzyme%20kinetics">Michaelis–Menten equation</a>

where the modifying factors α and α' are defined by the inhibitor concentration and its two dissociation constants

Thus, in the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective "K" and "V" become (α/α')"K" and (1/α')"V", respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate "K"' kinetically if "K" is measured independently.

The effects of different types of reversible enzyme inhibitors on enzymatic activity can be visualized using graphical representations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as <a href="Lineweaver%E2%80%93Burk%20plot">Lineweaver–Burk</a> and <a href="Eadie-Hofstee%20diagram">Eadie-Hofstee plots</a>. For example, in the Lineweaver–Burk plots at the right, the competitive inhibition lines intersect on the "y"-axis, illustrating that such inhibitors do not affect "V". Similarly, the non-competitive inhibition lines intersect on the "x"-axis, showing these inhibitors do not affect "K". However, it can be difficult to estimate "K" and "K"' accurately from such plots, so it is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable <a href="nonlinear%20regression">nonlinear regression</a> methods, as described above.

Traditionally reversible enzyme inhibitors have been classified as competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive, according to their effects on "K" and "V". These different effects result from the inhibitor binding to the enzyme E, to the enzyme–substrate complex ES, or to both, respectively. The division of these classes arises from a problem in their derivation and results in the need to use two different binding constants for one binding event. The binding of an inhibitor and its effect on the enzymatic activity are two distinctly different things, another problem the traditional equations fail to acknowledge. In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100% inhibition of the enzyme only, and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between. The common form of the inhibitory term also obscures the relationship between the inhibitor binding to the enzyme and its relationship to any other binding term be it the Michaelis–Menten equation or a dose response curve associated with ligand receptor binding. To demonstrate the relationship the following rearrangement can be made:

This rearrangement demonstrates that similar to the Michaelis–Menten equation, the maximal rate of reaction depends on the proportion of the enzyme population interacting with its substrate.

fraction of the enzyme population bound by substrate

fraction of the enzyme population bound by inhibitor

the effect of the inhibitor is a result of the percent of the enzyme population interacting with inhibitor. The only problem with this equation in its present form is that it assumes absolute inhibition of the enzyme with inhibitor binding, when in fact there can be a wide range of effects anywhere from 100% inhibition of substrate turn over to just >0%. To account for this the equation can be easily modified to allow for different degrees of inhibition by including a delta "V" term.

or

This term can then define the residual enzymatic activity present when the inhibitor is interacting with individual enzymes in the population. However the inclusion of this term has the added value of allowing for the possibility of activation if the secondary "V" term turns out to be higher than the initial term. To account for the possibly of activation as well the notation can then be rewritten replacing the inhibitor "I" with a modifier term denoted here as "X".

While this terminology results in a simplified way of dealing with kinetic effects relating to the maximum velocity of the Michaelis–Menten equation, it highlights potential problems with the term used to describe effects relating to the "K". The "K" relating to the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate should in most cases relate to potential changes in the binding site of the enzyme which would directly result from enzyme inhibitor interactions. As such a term similar to the one proposed above to modulate "V" should be appropriate in most situations:



As enzymes have evolved to bind their substrates tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising that some of these inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. Inhibitors of DHFR are prominent examples. Other example of these substrate mimics are the <a href="Protease%20inhibitor%20%28pharmacology%29">protease inhibitors</a>, a very successful class of <a href="antiretroviral%20drug">antiretroviral drug</a>s used to treat <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. The structure of <a href="ritonavir">ritonavir</a>, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.

Enzyme inhibitors are often designed to mimic the <a href="transition%20state">transition state</a> or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower "K") than substrate-based designs. An example of such a transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug <a href="oseltamivir">oseltamivir</a>; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring <a href="oxonium%20ion">oxonium ion</a> in the reaction of the viral enzyme <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a>.

However, not all inhibitors are based on the structures of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor <a href="tipranavir">tipranavir</a> is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for <a href="peptidase">peptidase</a>s and are less likely to be degraded.

In drug design it is important to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some <a href="protein%20kinase">protein kinase</a> inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a>, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.

Irreversible inhibitors usually <a href="covalent">covalent</a>ly modify an enzyme, and inhibition can therefore not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional groups such as <a href="nitrogen%20mustard">nitrogen mustard</a>s, <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s, <a href="haloalkane">haloalkane</a>s, <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s, <a href="Michael%20acceptor">Michael acceptor</a>s, <a href="sulfonate">phenyl sulfonate</a>s, or <a href="Methoxy%20arachidonyl%20fluorophosphonate">fluorophosphonate</a>s. These <a href="electrophile">electrophilic</a> groups react with amino acid side chains to form <a href="covalent%20adducts">covalent adducts</a>. The residues modified are those with side chains containing <a href="nucleophile">nucleophile</a>s such as <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> or <a href="thiol">sulfhydryl</a> groups; these include the amino acids <a href="serine">serine</a> (as in <a href="diisopropylfluorophosphate">DFP</a>, right), <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>, <a href="threonine">threonine</a>, or <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>.

Irreversible inhibition is different from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a> but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause <a href="denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a> of all <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a>, but this is a non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> will hydrolyse the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.

Irreversible inhibitors display time-dependent inhibition and their potency therefore cannot be characterised by an IC value. This is because the amount of active enzyme at a given concentration of irreversible inhibitor will be different depending on how long the inhibitor is pre-incubated with the enzyme. Instead, "k"/["I"] values are used, where "k" is the observed pseudo-first order rate of inactivation (obtained by plotting the log of % activity vs. time) and ["I"] is the concentration of inhibitor. The "k"/["I"] parameter is valid as long as the inhibitor does not saturate binding with the enzyme (in which case "k" = "k").

As shown in the figure to the right, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI) and this then reacts to produce the covalently modified "dead-end complex" EI*. The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or "k". Since formation of EI may compete with ES, binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition either with substrate or with a second, reversible inhibitor. This protection effect is good evidence of a specific reaction of the irreversible inhibitor with the active site.

The binding and inactivation steps of this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying the amount of activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following <a href="exponential%20decay">exponential decay</a>. Fitting these data to a <a href="rate%20equation">rate equation</a> gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give "k" and "K".

Another method that is widely used in these analyses is <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>. Here, accurate measurement of the mass of the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a <a href="MALDI-TOF">MALDI-TOF</a> mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, <a href="peptide%20mass%20fingerprinting">peptide mass fingerprinting</a> involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a <a href="protease">protease</a> such as <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a>. This will produce a set of <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.

Not all irreversible inhibitors form covalent adducts with their enzyme targets. Some reversible inhibitors bind so tightly to their target enzyme that they are essentially irreversible. These tight-binding inhibitors may show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. In these cases, some of these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and this then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex (see figure above). This kinetic behaviour is called slow-binding. This slow rearrangement after binding often involves a <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a> as the enzyme "clamps down" around the inhibitor molecule. Examples of slow-binding inhibitors include some important drugs, such <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a>, <a href="allopurinol">allopurinol</a>, and the activated form of <a href="acyclovir">acyclovir</a>.

<a href="Diisopropylfluorophosphate">Diisopropylfluorophosphate</a> (DFP) is shown as an example of an irreversible protease inhibitor in the figure <a href="%23Irreversible%20inhibitors">above right</a>. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the <a href="catalytic%20triad">active site</a>, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of <a href="acetylcholine%20esterase">acetylcholine esterase</a> in the <a href="synapses">synapses</a> of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100 mg.

<a href="Suicide%20inhibition">Suicide inhibition</a> is an unusual type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of <a href="polyamine">polyamine</a> biosynthesis, <a href="eflornithine">α-difluoromethylornithine</a> or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid <a href="ornithine">ornithine</a>, and is used to treat <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">African trypanosomiasis</a> (sleeping sickness). <a href="Ornithine%20decarboxylase">Ornithine decarboxylase</a> can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction is followed by the elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated <a href="imine">imine</a>, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.

Since irreversible inhibition often involves the initial formation of a non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme in more than one way. For example, in the figure showing <a href="trypanothione">trypanothione reductase</a> from the human protozoan parasite "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>", two molecules of an inhibitor called "quinacrine mustard" are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its <a href="nitrogen%20mustard">nitrogen mustard</a> group.
New drugs are the products of a long <a href="drug%20development">drug development</a> process, the first step of which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by <a href="combinatorial%20chemistry">combinatorial chemistry</a> approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and <a href="high-throughput%20screening">high-throughput screening</a> technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.

More recently, an alternative approach has been applied: <a href="rational%20drug%20design">rational drug design</a> uses the <a href="protein%20structure">three-dimensional structure</a> of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then used to try to obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. <a href="Bioinformatics">Computer-based methods</a> of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as <a href="Docking%20%28molecular%29">molecular docking</a> and <a href="molecular%20mechanics">molecular mechanics</a>.

Enzyme inhibitors are found in nature and are also designed and produced as part of <a href="pharmacology">pharmacology</a> and <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. Natural <a href="poison">poison</a>s are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against <a href="predation">predators</a>. These natural toxins include some of the most poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s such as <a href="malathion">malathion</a>, <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s such as <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>, or <a href="disinfection">disinfectants</a> such as <a href="triclosan">triclosan</a>. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block <a href="acetylcholinesterase">acetylcholinesterase</a>, an enzyme which breaks down <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a>, and are used as <a href="nerve%20agent">nerve agent</a>s in <a href="chemical%20warfare">chemical warfare</a>.

The most common uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim to correct a pathological condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as <a href="anticonvulsant">anti-epileptic drugs</a>, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called <a href="enzyme%20induction%20and%20inhibition">enzyme induction and inhibition</a> and are alterations in <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>, which is unrelated to the type of enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a>s or <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">membrane receptors</a>.

An example of a medicinal enzyme inhibitor is <a href="sildenafil">sildenafil</a> (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of <a href="cGMP%20specific%20phosphodiesterase%20type%205">cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5</a>, the enzyme that degrades the <a href="cell%20signaling">signalling</a> molecule <a href="cyclic%20guanosine%20monophosphate">cyclic guanosine monophosphate</a>. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the <a href="corpus%20cavernosum%20penis">corpus cavernosum</a>, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases the activity of the enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last for a longer period of time.

Another example of the structural similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target is seen in the figure comparing the drug <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a> to <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a>. Folic acid is a substrate of <a href="dihydrofolate%20reductase">dihydrofolate reductase</a>, an enzyme involved in making <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a>, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>.

Drugs also are used to inhibit enzymes needed for the survival of <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick <a href="bacterial%20cell%20structure">cell wall</a> made of a net-like polymer called <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a>. Many antibiotics such as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> and <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a> inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the <a href="DD-transpeptidase">transpeptidase</a> from the bacteria "Streptomyces" R61 (the protein is shown as a <a href="protein%20structure">ribbon-diagram</a>).

Antibiotic <a href="drug%20design">drug design</a> is facilitated when an enzyme that is essential to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences in the structure of the <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s in bacteria, or how they make <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s.

Enzyme inhibitors are also important in metabolic control. Many <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s in the cell are inhibited by <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s that control enzyme activity through <a href="allosteric%20regulation">allosteric regulation</a> or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the <a href="glycolysis">glycolytic pathway</a>. This <a href="catabolism">catabolic</a> pathway consumes <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and produces <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>, <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">NADH</a> and <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a>. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by <a href="phosphofructokinase">phosphofructokinase-1</a> (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease the rate of the enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This <a href="feedback">negative feedback</a> control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, <a href="fructose%202%2C6-bisphosphate">fructose 2,6-bisphosphate</a> and <a href="Adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.

Physiological enzyme inhibition can also be produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as <a href="zymogen">zymogen</a>s. Many of these are activated by the <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a> protease, so it is important to inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent <a href="trypsin%20inhibitor">trypsin inhibitor</a> protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the <a href="barstar">barstar</a> inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease <a href="barnase">barnase</a>.

Many <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s are enzyme inhibitors. <a href="Acetylcholinesterase">Acetylcholinesterase</a> (AChE) is an enzyme found in animals from insects to humans. It is essential to nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> into its constituents, <a href="acetate">acetate</a> and <a href="choline">choline</a>. This is somewhat unusual among neurotransmitters as most, including <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>, and <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>, are absorbed from the <a href="synaptic%20cleft">synaptic cleft</a> rather than cleaved. A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture. Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as <a href="edrophonium">edrophonium</a>, <a href="physostigmine">physostigmine</a>, and <a href="neostigmine">neostigmine</a>, are used in the treatment of <a href="myasthenia%20gravis">myasthenia gravis</a> and in anaesthesia. The <a href="carbamate">carbamate</a> pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors. The <a href="organophosphate">organophosphate</a> pesticides such as <a href="malathion">malathion</a>, <a href="parathion">parathion</a>, and <a href="chlorpyrifos">chlorpyrifos</a> irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.

The herbicide <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a> is an inhibitor of <a href="3-phosphoshikimate%201-carboxyvinyltransferase">3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase</a>, other herbicides, such as the sulfonylureas inhibit the enzyme <a href="acetolactate%20synthase">acetolactate synthase</a>. Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make branched-chain <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s and <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s and the processes of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>.

Animals and plants have evolved to synthesise a vast array of poisonous products including <a href="secondary%20metabolite">secondary metabolite</a>s, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually <a href="Small%20molecule">small organic molecules</a> and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, <a href="paclitaxel">paclitaxel</a> (taxol), an organic molecule found in the <a href="Taxus">Pacific yew tree</a>, binds tightly to <a href="tubulin">tubulin</a> dimers and inhibits their assembly into <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a>s in the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>.

Many natural poisons act as <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s that can cause <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the <a href="glycoalkaloid">glycoalkaloid</a>s, from the plant species in the "<a href="Solanaceae">Solanaceae</a>" family (includes <a href="potato">potato</a>, <a href="tomato">tomato</a> and <a href="eggplant">eggplant</a>), that are <a href="cholinesterase">acetylcholinesterase</a> inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, <a href="atropine">atropine</a> from deadly nightshade ("<a href="Atropa%20belladonna">Atropa belladonna</a>") that functions as a <a href="competitive%20antagonist">competitive antagonist</a> of the <a href="acetylcholine%20receptor">muscarinic acetylcholine receptors</a>.

Although many natural toxins are secondary metabolites, these poisons also include peptides and proteins. An example of a toxic peptide is <a href="alpha-amanitin">alpha-amanitin</a>, which is found in relatives of the <a href="death%20cap">death cap</a> mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20II">RNA polymerase II</a> enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin <a href="microcystin">microcystin</a> is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of <a href="phosphatase">protein phosphatases</a>. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.

Proteins can also be natural poisons or <a href="antinutrient">antinutrient</a>s, such as the <a href="trypsin%20inhibitor">trypsin inhibitor</a>s (discussed above) that are found in some <a href="pulse%20%28legume%29">legume</a>s, as shown in the figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as irreversible inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is <a href="ricin">ricin</a>, an extremely potent protein toxin found in <a href="castor%20oil%20plant">castor oil beans</a>. This enzyme is a <a href="glycosidase">glycosidase</a> that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.

John/Eleanor Rykener

John Rykener, also known as Eleanor (<a href="Floruit">fl.</a> 1394), was a 14th-century <a href="transvestite">transvestite</a> sex worker arrested in December 1394 for performing a sex act with another man, John Britby, in London's <a href="Cheapside">Cheapside</a>. Although historians tentatively link Rykener to a prisoner of the same name, the only known facts of his life come from interrogation made by the mayor of London. Rykener was questioned on two offences: prostitution and sodomy. <a href="Prostitute">Prostitute</a>s were not usually arrested in London during this period, while sodomy was an offence against morality rather than <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, and so pursued in <a href="ecclesiastical%20court">ecclesiastical court</a>s. There is no evidence that Rykener was prosecuted for either crime.

Rykener said that he was introduced to sexual contact with men by Elizabeth Brouderer, a London <a href="Embroidery">embroideress</a> who dressed him as a woman and may have acted as his procurer. According to his account, he had sex with both men and women, including priests and nuns. Rykener spent part of summer 1394 in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, working both as a prostitute and as an embroideress. He later mentioned that in <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a> he had a sexual relationship with a woman. Rykener returned to London via <a href="Burford">Burford</a> in Oxfordshire, where he worked as a barmaid and continued with sex work. On his return to London, he had paid encounters near the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, just outside the City. Rykener was arrested with Britby one Sunday evening in women's clothes, which he was still wearing during his interrogation on 11 December. It was there that he described his encounters—and his sexual history—in great detail. But it appears that no charges were ever brought against him; or at least, no records have been found suggesting so. Nothing definite is known of Rykener after his interrogation; he has been tentatively identified as a John Rykener imprisoned by and escaping from the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a> in 1399.

Historians of social, sexual and gender history are especially interested in Rykener's case because of what it reveals about medieval views on sex and gender. <a href="Jeremy%20Goldberg">Jeremy Goldberg</a>, for example, views it firmly in the context of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">King Richard II</a>'s quarrel with the city of London—although he has also questioned the veracity of the entire record, and posited that the case was merely a propaganda piece by city officials. Historian James A. Schultz has viewed the affair as being of greater significance to historians than more famous medieval stories such as <a href="Tristan%20and%20Iseult">Tristan and Iseult</a>. <a href="Ruth%20Mazo%20Karras">Ruth Mazo Karras</a>—who in the 1990s rediscovered the Rykener case in the <a href="London%20Metropolitan%20Archives">City of London archives</a>—sees it as illustrating the difficulties the law has in addressing things it cannot describe. Modern interest in John/Eleanor Rykener has not been confined to <a href="academia">academia</a>. Rykener has appeared as a character in at least one work of popular <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>, and his story has been adapted for the stage.

<a href="Prostitution">Prostitution</a> was tightly regulated in fourteenth-century England, and <a href="brothels">brothels</a>—although not prostitution itself—were illegal in the City of London. City authorities tended not to prosecute individual sex workers, but focused on arresting the pimps and <a href="Procuring%20%28prostitution%29">procuresses</a> who lived off them. Prostitution was perceived as most dangerous to the moral fabric of society. Another sexual offence for which people could be prosecuted was <a href="sodomy">sodomy</a>, but this would generally be by the church in its own courts. Of these two sexual offences, sodomy was deemed the worse. The thirteenth-century <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> and <a href="theologian">theologian</a> <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> compared prostitution to a sewer controlling the flow of waste, saying that if one were to remove it, one would "fill the palace with foulness". Aquinas then expanded on the point, saying "take away prostitutes from the world and you will fill it with sodomy". Prostitution was thus seen as a necessary evil, that if not eliminated could be controlled. The <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>'s <a href="Mayor%27s%20and%20City%20of%20London%20Court">secular court</a> would not have been seen as competent to hear cases involving either offence.

In late-fourteenth-century London, it was considered socially unacceptable for a man to habitually wear women's clothes. There were exceptions if it was deliberately obvious or necessary—for example, in theatre, or <a href="mystery%20play">mystery play</a>s. <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20%28feast%29">Corpus Christi</a> <a href="mystery%20play">mystery play</a>s, as the historian Katie Normington notes, provided an occasion "where gender identity could be tested or disrupted". Conversely, the limited number of such opportunities, says <a href="Vern%20Bullough">Vern Bullough</a>, meant that male-to-female <a href="transvestism">transvestism</a> was effectively non-existent in public society. But beneath the surface, suggests Ruth Evans, London was "a place of unrivalled sexual and economic opportunities".

<a href="Intersex">Hermaphroditism</a> too had a legally recognised status; the thirteenth-century <a href="jurist">jurist</a> <a href="Henry%20de%20Bracton">Henry de Bracton</a>, for example, had discussed it in his "<a href="Laws%20and%20Customs%20of%20England">Laws and Customs of England</a>", and there was a strong tradition of fictionalising it. The best-known, a story told by at least four separate German chroniclers in the 1380s, was from <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>. The protagonist dressed as a woman by night and sold sex out of a booth. By day, he was a priest and was eventually discovered when a client recognised him celebrating <a href="Mass%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">mass</a>. The medieval historian <a href="Jeremy%20Goldberg">Jeremy Goldberg</a> has compared the Lübeck and Rykener cases: both involved "cross-dressing, dishonesty, the close association of priests with homosexual activity, and the eventual intervention of the city authorities".

All that is known of Rykener's life comes from his answers during his interrogation in the Lord Mayor's court, following his arrest in December 1394. At these proceedings, he described in some detail how he had come to learn his trade as a prostitute when living with a London embroideress, who also taught him her needlecraft. He also told the court with whom and where he subsequently plied those trades. Rykener also told how he had only recently returned to London after visiting other parts of southern England prior to his arrest in Cheapside, a busy commercial district of London.

At his interrogation, Rykener described how he was first dressed as a woman at the <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a> house of one Elizabeth Brouderer. Following the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">1348–1349 outbreak of bubonic plague</a>—which killed between and of the English population—female apprenticeships had become as common as those for boys, particularly in London. Here he was taught how to sleep with men as a woman and to be paid for doing so. He also learned embroidery there, and may have completed an apprenticeship under Brouderer, as female apprentices did. Rykener described his situation in some detail, naming the various men he met there:

The sex lessons, Rykener explained, were so that Brouderer could give her daughter, Alice, to men at night, while it was dark so they could not see her. Alice would then leave her client before daybreak, and Brouderer would tell the man that he had slept with Rykener. Rykener would be present in front of the client, wearing women's clothes and called Eleanor by Brouderer. One of the men Rykener had intercourse with in Brouderer's house was the <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">Rector</a> of <a href="Theydon%20Garnon">Theydon Garnon</a>, called Philip. After having sex with the Rector, Rykener stole two <a href="gowns">gowns</a> from him. The latter gave up trying to retrieve his property when Rykener told Philip that Rykener was the wife of an important man in the city. This would have forced the Rector to sue Rykener's supposed-husband in court for the return of Philip's property. Brouderer's motives in using of Rykener this way have been the subject of speculation among scholars. John Roxeth, considering Brouderer's treatment of Rector Philip, has suggested that she used Rykener to blackmail men, although he does not extrapolate on the mechanics of her doing so. Roxeth's theory is not universally accepted; Jeremy Goldberg, for instance, notes Roxeth's suggestion without commenting on its probability, while Ruth Karras considers Rykener to have merely been prostituted in the usual fashion.

By August 1394, Rykener had moved to Oxford. He continued his sex work, but also obtained work as an embroideress: Brouderer had clearly been successful at teaching him both. Among Rykener's sexual clients, he reported, were "three unsuspecting scholars", or ""scolares ignotos"", whom Rykener named as three knights, Sir William Foxley, a Sir John and a Sir Walter. They may not have known Rykener's true sex, and the recorder's phrasing is ambiguous. The three knights had used Rykener's services frequently. The historian <a href="Carolyn%20Dinshaw">Carolyn Dinshaw</a> has questioned whether their ignorance of Rykener's gender could have lasted for the duration of the sojourn. More likely, she suggests, at some point they realised—and continued. Rykener encouraged a wealthy, often ecclesiastical clientele, in both his professions. The upper classes employed embroiderers, especially the clergy with their ecclesiastical vestments. A seamstress, by contrast, was almost strictly proletarian.
In September 1394, Rykener moved west to <a href="Burford">Burford</a>, where he lived with the innkeeper John Clerk, who employed him as a <a href="barmaid">barmaid</a>. Rykener's clients at this time included two <a href="Franciscans">Franciscan friars</a>—whom he named as Brother John and Brother Michael—the latter of whom paid with a gold ring. Other customers included a <a href="Carmelites">Carmelite friar</a> and six foreigners. Three of the latter paid Rykener, respectively, twelve pence, twenty pence, and "as much as two shillings for a single encounter". His stay in Burford seems to have been brief, and it was not long before he was in <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>. Rykener did not confine himself to sleeping with men as a woman; while in Burford, Rykener said, he had a sexual relationship, as a man, with a woman called Joan Matthew. For his encounters with women, Rykener took no payment; at least, he did not say that he did. He also continued his sex-work in Beaconsfield, this time with two more (foreign) Franciscans.

Rykener returned to London later in the year. He told his inquisitors that since doing so, he had had an encounter with a Sir John, whom Rykener said had once been <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> at <a href="St%20Margaret%20Pattens">St Margaret Pattens</a>. Two other chaplains were also among his customers, whom he had met in the back streets of <a href="St%20Katharine%27s%20by%20the%20Tower">St Katharine's by the Tower</a>. Whether Rykener's clients wanted a man or a woman is unknown. Britby and Rykener were arrested later in Cheapside. Britby claimed to have been looking for a woman, but, Dinshaw believed that, given he was under arrest at the time, was hardly likely to say otherwise. Another client, Theydon Garnon's rector, also seems to have wanted (and indeed believed he had been with) a woman, and was never told otherwise.

On the Sunday before his meeting with the mayor, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, Rykener was by Soper Lane, off Cheapside, and looking—as Dinshaw phrases it—"woman enough" to attract the attention of the Yorkshireman John Britby. Rykener said Britby propositioned him in Cheapside, and they went to Soper Lane. They also caught the attention of "certain officers of the city", who arrested them. They were accused of "lying by a certain stall in Soper's Lane, committing that detestable unmentionable and ignominious vice". Rykener was interrogated in the same female clothes he had been arrested in. He introduced himself as "Eleanor" to the mayor and officials during these proceedings. The "unmentionable" act they were accused of committing, suggests Jeremy Goldberg, was presumably anal sex. There can be no certainty on this point, as, Goldberg has pointed out, the clerk's language often consists of what Goldberg labels "knowingly opaque circumlocution". Rykener and Britby were interrogated separately by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">mayor</a>, <a href="John%20Fresshe">John Fresshe</a>, and the collected <a href="Alderman">aldermen</a> of the <a href="Common%20council%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">common council</a>. The precise date of the interrogations is unknown; the original document in the Common Council's Plea and Memoranda Rolls (itself, says Goldberg, only kept in a "rather loose chronological order") can be dated only by its position immediately preceding a plaint regarding a property dispute on 26 January 1395.

Britby said that he was passing through Cheapside when he met Rykener, and acknowledged that he propositioned him. Britby claimed to have done so in the belief that he was talking to a woman. Either way, Rykener had agreed to sex with him and named a price, which he agreed to pay. Rykener confirmed this story. The rest of it, the officials knew: caught in the act by the local <a href="Watchman%20%28law%20enforcement%29">watch</a>, Rykener and Britby had been taken away and imprisoned. When Rykener was asked where he had got the idea for such work, he said that "a certain Anna, the whore of a former servant of Sir Thomas Blount" had taught him to act as a woman, and that Elizabeth Brouderer first dressed him so.

Medieval English legal investigation was inquisitorial, with facts established through question and answer. Rykener's answers were given in English but transcribed into Latin for the record. Thus his account, as recorded, was not his personal <a href="confession">confession</a>, but rather conveyed the sense, possibly <a href="Gloss%20%28annotation%29">a gloss</a>, of what he intended. Such questioning, believe Karras and Boyd, would have been a particularly "'heavy burden' for Rykener to bear alone". Rykener also told the mayor and aldermen how he frequently had had sexual intercourse with women as a man. He was uncertain, when asked, whether they were married or not, but they included nuns: "how many he did not know". Rykener's responses suggest that officialdom was particularly concerned with the moral question of adulterous married women and sexually active "religieuses". Rykener told them that his encounters, whether with men or women, occurred in taverns, public places, and private houses. Whatever the mayor and his colleagues intended, most—if not everything—of what Rykener told them was beyond their court's jurisdiction. Goldberg notes how the scribal clerks went to great trouble to record extraneous, background material that took place many miles outside that jurisdiction.

Britby began his interrogation supposedly unaware of Rykener's true sex. He had been disabused by the end of it. Carolyn Dinshaw has suggested that this may indicate that "they hadn't really gotten started in that libidinous act" at the point they were arrested, so Britby had not had a chance to find out. Britby does not appear to have been charged with a crime. The one thing he could have been charged with, <a href="fornication">fornication</a>, would have had to be prosecuted in an ecclesiastical court, and so was also beyond the mayoral court's jurisdiction. Prostitutes were generally not prosecuted in the mayoral court. Perhaps Rykener was sufficiently different to warrant their notice. He was, after all, "no poor young woman forced or tricked into selling her body in order to get by, the pawn of the pimp or <a href="procurer">procurer</a> who controlled her, nor was he offering vaginal sex". If Rykener was charged with any offence, the outcome of the case is unknown. There is not, says Goldberg, any "further record of any response or action on the part of the court nor any further notice of Rykener". There are no explicit charges, verdict or sentence. Contemporaries understood a prostitute was not just a woman who took money for sex, but a sinful woman. Therefore, even if a man took money for sex, like Rykener, he could not be—to the medieval mind—a prostitute, and so could not be prosecuted as one. If he was eventually released after interrogation but without charge, it may have been because the mayor and aldermen of London "did not quite know what to make of him". Indeed, It was extremely unusual for a case like Rykener's to be heard in a mayoral court in the first place. It is not clear what form of legal process was followed. There may have been some confusion among Rykener's interrogators regarding how he was to be dealt with: sodomy was beyond the court's jurisdiction.

Rykener disappeared from historical records after the interrogation, with nothing certain known of his later life. The name itself is sufficiently unusual, to have allowed researchers to speculate. Jeremy Goldberg tentatively identified him as the John Rykener who was imprisoned in the <a href="Robert%20Braybrooke">Bishop of London's</a> <a href="gaol">gaol</a> in <a href="Bishop%27s%20Stortford">Bishop's Stortford</a>, and who escaped in 1399. The reason for this man's imprisonment is unknown. That he fell under episcopal jurisdiction suggests he had ecclesiastical status, most probably being an ecclesiastical clerk. In this gaol, most prisoners were convicted clerks. If this is the same John Rykener, his imprisonment in Bishop's Stortford would not have been for the same offences he was questioned for in 1394: having sexual relations would not get a bishop's clerk imprisoned. Contemporary records report nothing of this Rykener's background or events after his escape. There was an investigation, but this focused on the Bishop of London's poor record in keeping his prisoners secure rather than on the individuals themselves.

John/Eleanor Rykener's arrest and interrogation took place at the height of the spread of <a href="Lollardy">Lollardy</a>. Lollardism was deemed <a href="heresy">heresy</a>, and it was only a few weeks after Rykener's arrest that its followers promulgated their <a href="The%20Twelve%20Conclusions%20of%20the%20Lollards">"Twelve Conclusions"</a>. The Rykener case, comments Dinshaw, must have been "like a nightmare of the Lollard imagination", consisting as it did of a "cross-dressed prostitute who had had sex with so many clerics s/he couldn't remember them all confirm[ing] the Lollards' lowest expectations of the prelacy". The third of the Lollards' twelve conclusions specifically addressed the question of clerical sodomy, which Lollardism blamed on the church's insistence on priestly <a href="Sexual%20abstinence">abstinence</a>.

The mayor too may also have had political reasons for bringing Rykener before the Bench. Doing so allowed him to demonstrate his commitment to strong law and order in the city. Goldberg suggests that the "staged and dramatic way" that the case is presented reflects its contrived nature and that the things that Rykener said were carefully chosen for transcription for the mayor's electoral purposes. The Rykener case would have bolstered mayor Fresshe's image at a time when it needed help. He had been accused—amongst other things—of imprisoning people who sued him for their rights. 
The Rykener case took place in a turbulent period in the city's relations with the King. Two years earlier Richard II had stripped the city of its <a href="Liberty%20%28division%29">liberties</a> and imprisoned <a href="John%20Hende%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%29">mayor John Hende</a> and his city <a href="sheriffs">sheriffs</a>. The city's privileges had only been restored in August 1394, following a loan of £10,000 from the city to the King. The ritual restoration of these liberties also took place on Cheapside. Goldberg notes that the King repaid that loan only the day before Rykener and Britby had been arrested; this is not necessarily coincidental, Goldberg says.

Goldberg argues that the King's original quarrel with London had been over (perceived) misgovernance, which necessitated him governing the city instead. The Rykener case can thus be viewed as an object lesson in good self-governance: "malefactors are swiftly detected and promptly brought to answer for their misdeeds". The city demonstrated, through Rykener, its ability to address "the frequent resort of, and consorting with, common harlots", which led to "many and divers affrays, broils, and dissensions". Rykener's interrogators seem to have been particularly interested in his dealings with the clergy, which may account for their bringing him before a mayoral court originally. Sodomy came under ecclesiastical jurisdiction, prostitution was a civic offence, and cases concerning priests were traditionally dealt with by church courts. Such was the unpopularity of the clergy, suggests Goldberg, that "courts would welcome the opportunity thus presented of showing up a man in holy orders", even if they were unable to prosecute him.

<a href="Judith%20Bennett">Judith Bennett</a> considers that the frequency with which hermaphroditism is mentioned in contemporary texts indicates an incurious acceptance of the condition. If so, she suggests, "Rykener's repeated forays into the space between 'male' and 'female' might have been as unremarkable in the streets of fourteenth-century London as they would be in Soho today".

Historians have been aware of Rykener's case since a <a href="calendar">calendar</a>ed version of the legal record was published by <a href="Arthur%20Hermann%20Thomas">Arthur Hermann Thomas</a> in his 1932 "Calendar of Select Plea and Memoranda Rolls, London, 1381–1412". Thomas's summary was noted only that an examination had taken place "of two men charged with immorality, of whom one implicated several persons, male and female, in religious orders". The case remained in obscurity until the mid-1990s, when the original manuscript records were discovered by <a href="Ruth%20Mazo%20Karras">Ruth Mazo Karras</a> and <a href="David%20Lorenzo%20Boyd">David Lorenzo Boyd</a> in the <a href="London%20Metropolitan%20Archives">London Metropolitan Archives</a>. The Rykener documents were filed with the more usual, and more prosaic, fare of debt and property offences that the mayor's court traditionally dealt with. It has been suggested that of particular concern for the officials was not so much the act itself, but Rykener's switching of gender roles. This perceived importance may account for the survival of the record, as it may have been considered to have set a <a href="precedent">precedent</a>.

The manuscript of Rykener's interrogation, according to one commentator, forms "apparently the only legal process document from late medieval England which deals with same-sex intercourse". The case has been described as offering a "microcosmic view of medieval English sexualities and the gulf that lies between the medieval and the modern"—the words used in both periods to describe sexuality mean different things to each. Rykener's case is also significant for its rarity. Surviving records from the fifteenth century provide only two examples of similar cases coming to court.

It is impossible in the twenty-first century to know what Rykener's encounters meant for him. As Ruth Karras has pointed out, scholarship on such affairs, "because it relies on court records, has focused much more on acts than on feelings", just as the records do. Thus it is impossible to establish whether his encounters were brief, or part of longer-term relationships. The majority, suggests Karras, were the former. Karras and Boyd point out the difficulties in viewing Rykener today as he would have viewed himself. "In modern terms", they wrote, Rykener "would be described as a transvestite (because he cross-dressed) and a prostitute (because he took money for sex), and probably a bisexual" although this label is somewhat "problematic", they suggest, as scholars have no means of assessing what it would have meant to him.

Historian James A. Schulz has suggested that John Rykener's story is of more importance to historians than, for example, that of <a href="Tristan">Tristan</a> and <a href="Iseult">Isolde</a>. While <a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">their story</a> illustrates little of the true nature of <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a>—being a <a href="Paradigm%20shift">paradigm</a> and mythical rather than reality—Rykener's case tells much about the "marginal, transgressive" world of medieval sexuality. Rykener's responses to his interrogators have been described as one of the very few glimpses the modern era has into medieval <a href="Sexual%20identity">sexual identities</a>. Another scholar has described the Rykener case as, with its "tangled language and arresting mix of frankness and ambiguity ... remain[ing] a mainstay of medieval, queer and gender studies ever since" Karras's discovery. Normington has described the case as an example of a medieval court "grappling with gender distinctions". Karras has argued that Rykener is a medieval example of a <a href="transgender">transgender</a> person, rather than merely a transvestite or cross-dresser. Karras says that "even if we do not know anything about Rykener's self-identification, her life as a male-bodied woman was 'transgender-like'." Karras notes that nothing is known of Rykener's (or anybody else's) feelings in this case, and since the interrogation was recorded in Latin (which he may not have known), historians may not have an accurate record of what he really said. The only time he ever seems to have offered a personal opinion on what he did was when he opined to preferring priests: but this was "only because they paid more". Carolyn Dinshaw suggests that Rykener's living and working in Oxford as a women for a time indicates that Rykener enjoyed doing so. Likewise, Cordelia Beattie considers that his ability to pass as a woman "in everyday life would have involved other gendered behaviour". She considers that to modern historians and <a href="sociologists">sociologists</a>, the Rykener case is part of a "long-standing tradition" within the study of gender. In her view, the case reveals the social presumptions held by the mayor and common council through their treatment of him. For example, says Beattie, "it is noticeable that, according to the record, the men had sex with him, whereas he had sex with the women".Jeremy Goldberg has looked at the case in the context of where Rykener operated, as Cheapside was a major mercantile centre. Goldberg considers that the mayor and aldermen were most concerned with Rykener as a trader, and as a false one at that: "a tradesperson who purports to be an embroideress and a barmaid, but actually sells sex. ... Even as a prostitute he is a dishonest trader: he poses as a woman selling straight sex to male clients, whereas he is, in fact, a man masquerading as a woman." Goldberg suggests that historians may have misread the true significance of the original document. It is possible, he says, that the whole case was a fabrication by the scribes, who wanted to officially lodge an unofficial allegory against the King. Hence Rykener becomes a metaphor for Richard II following the dispute over the city's liberties and, much like Rykener was described in the accusation, Richard is "symbolically buggered" in Cheapside.

Ruth Evans, continuing the mercantile theme, has described Rykener as "counterfeiting" his body for payment. During his interrogation, his sexual act with Britby was referred to on at least one occasion as "labour". If the mayor and aldermen are concerned with Rykener's honesty (or not), says Goldberg, then it is "here a specifically bourgeois concern that grows out of the needs of trade". Judith Bennett has suggested that Rykener, through his choice of work, had "taken a women's passive position in society", and that it was this—rather than the actual offences of prostitution and sodomy—that "most transfixed" Rykener's interrogators. From this, and in comparison to her own period, she concludes that "gender was no more ordered in the middle ages than it is in the twenty-first century".

A fictionalised version of Rykener appears as a prominent character in <a href="Bruce%20Holsinger">Bruce Holsinger</a>'s 2014 <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>, "A Burnable Book", set in London in 1385. Rykener (whom Holsinger renames Edgar) acts as the reader's guide to the "juicy places" of fourteenth-century London's underworld. A <a href="puppet%20show">puppet show</a> intended to explore Rykener as transgender—"combining medieval studies, drama, and puppetry"—called "John–Eleanor" debuted in 2011 and was performed at the <a href="Turku%20music%20festival">Turku music festival</a> in Finland the following year. It was later performed at the <a href="World%20Puppetry%20Festival">World Puppetry Festival</a> in <a href="Charleville-M%C3%A9zi%C3%A8res">Charleville-Mézières</a>, France, in 2017, with <a href="Timo%20Vantsi">Timo Vantsi</a> playing the title role. It was also performed in Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Maraba coffee

Maraba coffee (; ) is grown in the <a href="Maraba%2C%20Rwanda">Maraba</a> area of southern <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>.

Maraba's coffee plants are the <a href="Bourbon%20coffee">Bourbon variety</a> of the "<a href="Coffea%20arabica">Coffea arabica</a>" species and are grown on fertile <a href="Volcano%23Effects%20of%20volcanoes">volcanic soils</a> on high-altitude hills. The <a href="Coffea">fruit</a> is handpicked, mostly during the <a href="rainy%20season">rainy season</a> between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the <a href="coffee%20bean">coffee bean</a>s are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.

The beans are sold to various roasting companies, with the best beans going to <a href="Union%20Hand%20-%20Roasted%20Coffee">Union Coffee Roasters</a> of the United Kingdom, who produce a <a href="Fairtrade%20certification">Fairtrade-certified</a> brand and <a href="Community%20Coffee">Community Coffee</a> of the United States. Rwanda Specialty Coffee Roasters buys from Maraba and sells to the domestic market. Maraba coffee is also brewed into a <a href="beer">beer</a>.

About 2,000 <a href="smallholding">smallholder</a> farmers grow the <a href="Coffea">coffee plants</a> under the "Abahuzamugambi" <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a>, founded in 1999. Since 2000, the cooperative has been supported by the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Rwanda">National University of Rwanda</a> (NUR) and the <a href="Partnership%20for%20Enhancing%20Agriculture%20in%20Rwanda%20through%20Linkages">PEARL</a>. The cooperative has improved coffee quality and penetrated the speciality market.

Rwandans have been growing coffee since <a href="History%20of%20Rwanda%23Colonial%20era">colonial times</a>, but until 1999 the product was classed below Grade C, making it unsalable on the global markets. The farmers did not have the means to wash and prepare their coffee cherries to specifications in a timely manner. Buyers paid <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>0.33 per kilogram, a price that kept the farmers poor.

In 1999, 220 coffee growers formed an association in the Maraba district (part of the former <a href="Butare%20Province">Butare Province</a>) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional <a href="gacaca%20court">gacaca court</a>s. They named the association "Abahuzamugambi", a <a href="Kinyarwanda%20language">Kinyarwanda</a> word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in <a href="Kigali">Kigali</a> instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.

In 2000, the mayor of Maraba requested development aid from the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Rwanda">National University of Rwanda</a> (UNR), based in nearby <a href="Butare">Butare</a>; the following year UNR helped found the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda through Linkages (PEARL). Several entities supported the PEARL project: <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">USAID</a>, <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>, <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a> and various Rwandan bodies including UNR, the national agricultural research institute (ISAR) and the <a href="Kigali%20Institute%20of%20Science%2C%20Technology%20and%20Management">Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management</a> (KIST). PEARL started working with "Abahuzamugambi" in February 2001 to improve the coffee quality to standards required by the specialty coffee market in the United States.

The coffee farmers of Maraba first needed a washing station to remove <a href="sugar">sugar</a> from the coating of the coffee bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the "Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda" (OCIR-Café), <a href="ACDI/VOCA">ACDI/VOCA</a>, and the "Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda" (ISAR). The opening was late in the harvest season, so only 200 kilograms (441 lb) of that year's harvest were suitable for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from <a href="Mount%20Huye">Mount Huye</a> to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.

A new certification system was introduced for the 2002 harvest to ensure that beans brought to the station were of suitable quality. Around half of the "Abahuzamugambi" membership attained the certification, which allowed the cooperative to look for serious buyers in the specialty markets of Europe and North America.

<a href="Partnership%20for%20Enhancing%20Agriculture%20in%20Rwanda%20through%20Linkages">PEARL</a> brought a specialty coffee expert to Rwanda, who put them in touch with a seller, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>-based <a href="Community%20Coffee">Community Coffee</a>, to help market Maraba. They sent samples to Louisiana, and in June 2002 a representative from Community visited Maraba. Rwandan president <a href="Paul%20Kagame">Paul Kagame</a> was also present, as the government placed great importance on the project. Community purchased an 18,000 kilogram (40,000 lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were <a href="coffee%20roasting">roasted</a> and blended into one of the company's gourmet coffees. This was the first direct contract between an American roaster and an African coffee cooperative.

<a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Comic Relief</a> also took an interest in Maraba. The 2001 Red Nose Day campaign had brought in <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>55 million for projects in the UK and Africa, some of which they pledged to the "<a href="Association%20des%20Veuves%20du%20Genocide">Association des Veuves du Genocide</a>" (AVEGA), an association of widows of the 1994 <a href="Rwandan%20Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>. The charity discovered that many of the Maraba smallholders were also members of AVEGA and could thus provide funding and support. They contacted <a href="Union%20Hand%20-%20Roasted%20Coffee">Union Coffee Roasters</a> (UCR), a British roasting company, whose representatives visited Maraba in 2002 with officials from the <a href="Fairtrade%20Labelling%20Organizations%20International">Fairtrade Labelling Organisation</a> (FLO). This group inspected the Maraba site and granted certification, making Maraba coffee the first Rwandan cooperative to gain Fairtrade status. UCR described the coffee as containing "sparkling <a href="citrus">citrus</a> flavours complemented by deep, sweet <a href="chocolate">chocolate</a> notes" and bought all the remaining produce from the 2002 harvest.

UCR distributed its Maraba Coffee in early 2003 via <a href="Sainsbury%27s">Sainsbury's</a> <a href="supermarket">supermarket</a>s, which sold the product in all 350 of its stores in the run up to that year's Red Nose Day. In 2003, the "Abahuzamugambi" Cooperative made US$35,000 in net profits. Of this, 70 percent was divided among the farmers at US$0.75 per kilogram provided, an amount more than three times that paid to other coffee growers in Rwanda and sufficient to pay for health care and education services which were not previously affordable. The remaining 30 percent was invested back into the cooperative and spent on buying <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>, an <a href="agricultural%20lime">agricultural lime</a> used to reduce <a href="acid">acid</a>ity in the soil caused by run off of minerals during rainfall.

Beginning in 2003, PEARL deemed the operation self-sufficient and reduced financial support for the "Abahuzamugambi" Cooperative. The cooperative provided its growers with loans that helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments, affordable medical insurance, and education. A cooperative bank was opened in the village in March, enabling farmers to maintain and manage their own funds locally, rather than having to trek the long distance to <a href="Butare">Butare</a>.

In late 2004, London-based <a href="Meantime%20Brewing">Meantime Brewing</a> began offering a coffee <a href="beer">beer</a> made out of beans grown in Maraba. The drink is intended as an alcoholic iced <a href="cappucino">cappucino</a> or <a href="digestif">digestif</a>. The head brewer tasted coffees from around the world but decided that the hints of <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a> and <a href="chocolate">chocolate</a> in Maraba coffee made it more suitable than the <a href="nut%20%28fruit%29">nutty</a> and <a href="Taste%23Bitterness">bitter</a> coffees from South America. The original beer had an <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol content</a> of 4 percent and the same <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> content as coffee, and was described as having a "silky, velvety character". It is sold in larger branches of Sainsbury's and in some pubs and clubs. The beverage was one of only two Fairtrade beers available on the UK market until 2006, when a reduction in the proportion of coffee and an increased alcohol content (now 6 percent) cost it its Fairtrade status. It is still made from Maraba beans. It is the only coffee beer available in the British Isles, and it won the Gold medal for the coffee-flavoured beer category at the 2006 Beer World Cup.

In 2006, the Swedish <a href="Minister%20for%20International%20Development%20Cooperation%20%28Sweden%29">Minister for Development Co-operation</a> and Deputy <a href="Ministry%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Sweden%29">Minister for Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="Carin%20Jamtin">Carin Jamtin</a>, visited Maraba to extend cooperation between Sweden and Rwanda and expose Maraba coffee to the Swedish specialty market. In July 2006, a <a href="telecentre">telecentre</a> was opened in Maraba under the coordination of PEARL. USAID, NUR and <a href="Washington%20State%20University">Washington State University</a> (WSU) Extension's <a href="Center%20to%20Bridge%20the%20Digital%20Divide">Center to Bridge the Digital Divide</a> (CBDD) provided funding and resources. Three WSU students spent six weeks in Rwanda helping to set up the centre and train the local staff, who now operate it.

Maraba coffee is grown in the south of Rwanda at coordinates , roughly 12 kilometres (7 mi) from <a href="Butare">Butare</a> and 150 kilometres (93 mi) from the capital, <a href="Kigali">Kigali</a>. The project began in the Maraba District of <a href="Butare%20Province">Butare Province</a>, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the <a href="Southern%20Province%2C%20Rwanda">Southern Province</a>. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the <a href="Western%20Rift%20Valley">Western Rift Valley</a> and the montane <a href="Nyungwe%20Forest">Nyungwe Forest</a>, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889 ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terrace farming</a>. The area experiences an average of 115 centimetres (45 in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 <a href="Celsius">°C</a> (68 <a href="Fahrenheit">°F</a>). There is little seasonal variation.

The main <a href="Coffee%20processing%23Picking">harvesting</a> season for coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March to the end of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.

The technicians start the <a href="Coffee%20processing%23Wet%20process">washing process</a> immediately, since delay can cause <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination of the coffee flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink to the bottom and pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them in the same way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating <a href="colander">colander</a>. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.

The technicians wash the beans several times to remove the remains of the skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative employees turn the beans regularly as technicians spot and remove bad beans. A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows (with provision for quick covering in the event of rain), again with constant turning. This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent.

The technicians then move the beans to the technical centre in nearby Kizi. Certain machines, housed in a warehouse up the side of the hill, remove the parchment skins from the beans. Employees take the beans into the adjacent laboratory for the final quality control process – hand sorting – which is carried out by several experienced women. The beans are bagged and labeled according to their quality, and stored in the compound's warehouse to await sale.

As of 2006, Maraba produces 80 <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s (73,000 kg) of export-quality coffee per year, of which 40 tons go to roasters and sellers in the United Kingdom and 40 tons to the United States.

The coffee appears in the following products:

Derrick Lonsdale (born 1924) Fellow of the American College of Nutrition (FACN), Fellow of the American College for Advancement in Medicine (FACAM) is a pediatrician and researcher into the benefits of certain nutrients in preventing disease and psychotic behavior. Thiamine is a special vitamin because as the cause of beriberi it is one of only four vitamins associated with a named pandemic deficiency disease. Of these four vitamins, only thiamine requires transport proteins to diffuse throughout the body. A thiamine derivative called TTFD is a thiamine precursor that does not require transport proteins to freely diffuse.

Lonsdale was a practitioner in <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a> at the <a href="Cleveland%20Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a> for 20 years. He became Head of the Section of Biochemical Genetics at the Clinic. The Cleveland Clinic is rated as the third best hospital in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

In 1982, Lonsdale retired from the Cleveland Clinic and joined the Preventive Medicine Group to specialize in <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>-based therapy.

He is also on the Scientific Research Advisory Committee of the American College for Advancement in Medicine and is an editor of their Journal.

Lonsdale has written over 100 published papers and the conclusions tend to support the idea that healing comes from the body itself rather than from external medical interventions.

Lonsdale has studied the use of nutrients to prevent <a href="disease">disease</a>s and his work has been favorably reviewed. He is particularly interested in <a href="Thiamine">Vitamin B</a>, also known as <a href="thiamine">thiamine</a>. Lonsdale's research on the effect of high doses of thiamine has been described as 'pioneering'.

Lonsdale led a successful (uncontrolled) study on the treatment of <a href="autism">autism</a> spectrum children with thiamine.

He also led a study (uncontrolled) of secretin in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Both of these studies are controversial because they link nutrition with autism. The study, "Lonsdale D and Shamberger R J (2000) "A clinical study of secretin in autism and pervasive developmental delay."

In 2002 Lonsdale caused controversy when he linked child violence (children killing other children) to dietary deficiencies rather than the accepted social causes. Lonsdale put this down to 'high calorie malnutrition' where children overeat high calories foods that lack vital nutrients resulting in an upset to 'brain balance'. He pointed the finger at a range of 'normal' foods as well as generally accepted junk foods.

The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold

The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is a novel by the British writer <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, first published in July <a href="1957%20in%20literature">1957</a>. It is Waugh's penultimate full-length work of fiction, which the author called his "mad book"—a <a href="autobiographical%20novel">largely autobiographical</a> account of a period of <a href="hallucinations">hallucinations</a> caused by <a href="bromism">bromide intoxication</a> that he experienced in the early months of 1954, recounted through his protagonist Gilbert Pinfold.

Waugh's health in the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various personal anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, <a href="bromide">bromide</a> and <a href="chloral">chloral</a> in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>, but was driven to the point of madness by <a href="auditory%20hallucination">imagined voices</a> that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold for the sake of his health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.

On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but its general critical reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh with which the novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending. Commentators have debated whether the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated as a means of preserving his privacy. The book has been dramatised for radio and as a stage play.

Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute who at the age of 50 can look back on a varied life that has included a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">Roman Catholicism</a> sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of <a href="Chloral%20hydrate">chloral</a> and <a href="Potassium%20bromide">bromide</a>. He conceals this practice from his doctor.

Pinfold is very protective of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees to be interviewed on <a href="BBC">BBC</a> radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS "Caliban", bound for <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations from other parts of the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.

To escape his persecutors Pinfold disembarks at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and flies on to <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, but the voices pursue him. Pinfold has now reconciled himself to their presence and is able to ignore them, or even converse rationally with them. After a brief stay in Colombo he returns to England. On the flight home he is told by "Angel" that the whole episode was a scientific experiment that got out of hand; if Pinfold will keep silent about his experiences, he is told, he will never be bothered by the voices again. Pinfold refuses, declaring Angel to be a menace that must be exposed. Back in England, Mrs Pinfold convinces him that Angel had never left the country and the voices are imaginary. Pinfold hears Margaret faintly say,"I don't exist, but I do love you", before the voices disappear forever. Pinfold's doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral. Pinfold views his courage in the battle against the voices as a significant victory in the battle with his personal demons, and he begins to write an account of his experiences: "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold".

<a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>'s professional and private circumstances, in the years after the Second World War, prefigured those of his fictional counterpart Pinfold. Before the war he had established himself as a writer, mainly of light <a href="satire">satirical</a> fiction. His wartime experiences, including service in the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a>, changed his personal and literary outlook, and put him into what his biographer David Wykes describes as "a mood of introspection ... that endured to the end of his career". Despite occasional reversions to his former style, in general Waugh's post-war fiction aspired to a more serious purpose. In an essay published in "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine in April 1946, he wrote: "In my future books there will be two things to make them unpopular: a preoccupation with style and the attempt to represent man more fully, which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." The commercial success of "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>", published in 1945, provided Waugh with the financial means to pursue his writing career in a leisurely fashion. He worked intermittently on his novel "<a href="Helena%20%28Waugh%20novel%29">Helena</a>" for five years, while completing shorter projects and carrying out much unpaid work, particularly for Catholic organisations. In a marked change from his pre-war life, he ceased to socialise and became increasingly concerned to protect his privacy. To this end he adopted an overtly hostile persona as a defence mechanism, to repel the outside world.

By the early 1950s Waugh was troubled on a number of fronts. He was afflicted with <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>, and was unable to make progress with his current novel, the second in his "<a href="Sword%20of%20Honour">Sword of Honour</a>" trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, <a href="sciatica">sciatica</a> and <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with <a href="cr%C3%A8me%20de%20menthe">crème de menthe</a>—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.

In January 1954 Waugh sailed on the SS "Staffordshire", bound for Ceylon. He hoped on the voyage to find the peace that would enable him to finish his stalled book. On board, his strange behaviour became an increasing concern to his fellow-passengers, and the letters which he wrote to his wife Laura from the ship alarmed her—Waugh appeared to be in the grip of a <a href="persecutory%20delusion">persecution mania</a> in which he was beset by threatening, malevolent voices. He left the ship at Alexandria and flew on to Ceylon, but the voices continued to harass him. He wrote to Laura: "Everything I say or think or read is read aloud by the group of psychologists whom I met in the ship ... the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away". Laura arranged for her friend <a href="Jack%20Donaldson%2C%20Baron%20Donaldson%20of%20Kingsbridge">Jack Donaldson</a> to fly out with her to Colombo to bring Waugh home, but before they could do so Waugh returned to London of his own volition. There he was persuaded by his friend, the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest Philip Caraman, to accept treatment from Eric Strauss, the head of psychiatry at <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a>. Strauss quickly diagnosed that Waugh's delusions arose from poisoning by his sleeping drugs, and substituted <a href="paraldehyde">paraldehyde</a> for chloral. The hallucinations disappeared immediately, and Waugh recovered his senses.

<a href="Christopher%20Sykes%20%28author%29">Christopher Sykes</a>, Waugh's friend and first biographer, believes that during his sessions with Strauss, Waugh may have discussed the idea of writing a fictional account of his hallucinatory experiences. He may have prepared a brief draft, but if so this has not come to light. In the three months following his return to his home, Piers Court at <a href="Stinchcombe">Stinchcombe</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, Waugh was inactive; when he resumed work his first task was to complete his "Sword of Honour" novel, "Officers and Gentlemen", which occupied him for most of the rest of 1954. In late December or early January 1955 he left for <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> for his usual winter in the sunshine, and began work on his new novel there. He chose the name "Pinfold" for his protagonist, after a <a href="Recusancy">recusant</a> family that had once owned Piers Court.
Waugh worked on the Pinfold novel intermittently during the next two years. After his return from Jamaica he set the book aside, confining his writing to journalism and occasional prefaces—"neat little literary jobs". There is no mention of "Pinfold" in his diary or in letters. Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard describes Waugh at this time as physically lazy, unable to harness his still considerable mental energies—the diary entry for 12 July 1955 notes the pattern of his days: "the morning post, the newspaper, the crossword, gin". Waugh's longstanding feud with the <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Beaverbrook</a> press preoccupied him, particularly after an uninvited visit to Piers Court by the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" journalist <a href="Nancy%20Spain">Nancy Spain</a> in June, that left Waugh "tremulous with rage". In March 1956 Spain attacked Waugh in an "Express" article, after which he began a <a href="libel">libel</a> action against her and her paper. Meanwhile, preparations for his daughter Teresa's <a href="Debutante">coming-out ball</a> provided a further hindrance to progress on the novel. It is not until 11 September 1956 that his diary records: "I have resumed work on "Pinfold"". Soon after, he was writing 1,000 words a day—on 26 September he told his friend Ann Fleming that "the mad book is going to be very funny I believe". A week later he asked his friend Daphne Fielding for permission to dedicate the book to her.

Waugh had decided in the summer of 1955 that he would sell Piers Court. By October 1956 the sale had been completed and he had acquired a new home in the <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> village of <a href="Combe%20Florey">Combe Florey</a>. While the chaos of the move went on around him, Waugh worked on the novel; in November he moved to his pre-war bolthole, the Easton Court Hotel at <a href="Chagford">Chagford</a>, where he hoped to finish the book. As the date for the libel case against Nancy Spain and the "Express" approached, Waugh was involved in a second libel action, against the author and journalist <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a> and <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a>, an additional distraction that delayed the novel's completion. In January 1957 Waugh rewrote the ending, creating a circularity with a return to the words that introduce the novel, and also gave the book its subtitle, "A Conversation Piece". Waugh did not explain his choice of wording for the subtitle, but David Wykes in his <a href="biography%20in%20literature">literary biography</a> believes it is an ironic reference to the traditional British paintings of families and friends in social gatherings; in this case the "conversation" is with enemies, not friends. The main title is an echo of <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith</a>'s Victorian novel "<a href="The%20Ordeal%20of%20Richard%20Feverel">The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</a>". By the end of January 1957 the book was in the publishers' hands.

Waugh confirmed the autobiographical basis for the novel on several occasions; at the book's launch on 19 July 1957, to <a href="Robert%20Henriques">Robert Henriques</a> in a letter of 15 August 1957 ("Mr Pinfold's experiences were almost exactly my own."), and to <a href="John%20Freeman%20%28British%20politician%29">John Freeman</a> in a <a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28British%20TV%20series%29">"Face to Face"</a> television interview in 1960. As well as the congruence with real life of specific incidents in the book, Pinfold's age and his domestic and professional circumstances as revealed in the first chapter closely mirror Waugh's. The fictional counterpart shares Waugh's aversions to modern life; he hates "plastic, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>, sunbathing and jazz—everything, in fact, that had happened in his own lifetime". Pinfold expresses the same attitude towards his books—"objects that he had made, things quite external to himself"—that Waugh had demonstrated in the second of his 1953 radio interviews.
The BBC interviewer Stephen Black appears in the novel as "Angel", and other associates of Waugh make brief appearances. The poet <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> is represented as "James Lance", Waugh's priest Philip Caraman is "Father Westmacott", and Christopher Sykes is "Roger Stillingfleet". In his biography Sykes maintains that the depiction of Mrs Pinfold does not represent Laura Waugh to any degree—"not the glimmer of a resemblance". The name "Margaret", awarded to Pinfold's gentler tormentor, was that of Waugh's second daughter for whom, he wrote to Ann Fleming in September 1952, he had developed a sexual passion. When cured of his hallucinations, Waugh confided to Nancy Mitford that his "unhealthy affection" for his daughter Margaret had disappeared.

Pinfold's adopted defensive persona, "a combination of eccentric don and testy colonel", was the same that Waugh cultivated to keep the world at bay. Pinfold adheres to an outmoded form of <a href="Tory">Tory</a>ism, does not vote, and expresses outrageous views, part-facetiously. Pinfold was "absurd to many but to some rather formidable". After Waugh's death, Nancy Mitford confirmed the essentially mocking nature of Waugh's persona: "What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything". While Waugh's biographer <a href="Selina%20Hastings%20%28writer%29">Selena Hastings</a> describes "Pinfold" as "an accurate and revealing self-portrait", Stannard suggests that it is primarily an analysis of the adopted persona in which, like Pinfold, Waugh "gives nothing away".

Among Waugh's neighbours in Stinchcombe was Diana Oldridge, known in the Waugh family as "Tanker". She was an organiser of local music festivals, and the possessor of a contraption known as "the Box". This device was reputed to cure all ills, by means of "sympathetic life-waves" working on some physical part of the victim—hairs, nail-clippings, or a drop of blood. Waugh himself was generally sceptical, even scornful of these powers, but some of his acquaintances claimed to have been cured by the Box, as apparently had one of Laura Waugh's cows. In letters to Laura from Cairo and Colombo, Waugh ascribed the voices he was hearing to the power of the Box, and instructs Laura to tell "Tanker" that he now believes in it.

In the novel, Pinfold initially dismisses the Box—described as resembling "a makeshift wireless set"—as "a lot of harmless nonsense", but, like Waugh, he is driven to revise his position in the face of his persecution by the voices. He believes that "Angel" is using an adapted form of the Box, as developed by the Germans at the end of the war and perfected by the "Existentialists" in Paris—"a hellish invention in the wrong hands". At the end of his ordeal Pinfold muses that had he not defied Angel but instead compromised with him, he might have continued to believe in the Box's sinister capabilities. He is finally convinced of the non-existence of a box with such powers by the assurances of his priest, Father Westmacott.

In contrast with Waugh's other late full-length fiction, religious themes are not prominent in "Pinfold". As with earlier novels, the "Catholic gentleman" is subject to a degree of ridicule and mockery; the voices speculate that Pinfold is Jewish, that his real name is "Peinfeld" and that his professed Catholicism is mere humbug invented to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy. Otherwise, Waugh uses the self-revelatory opening chapter of the novel to attribute to Pinfold his own traditional Roman Catholic beliefs. Pinfold is a convert, received into the Church in early manhood on the basis of a "calm acceptance of the propositions of his faith", rather than through than a dramatic or emotional event. While the Church was encouraging its adherents to engage with society and political institutions, Pinfold, like Waugh, "burrowed ever deeper into the rock, [holding himself] aloof from the multifarious organisations which have sprung into being at the summons of the hierarchy to redeem the times".

In an undated postcard (probably late 1956) to John McDougall of <a href="Chapman%20%26amp%3B%20Hall">Chapman & Hall</a>, Waugh's publishers, Waugh asks that McDougall seek permission from <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> to use one of the artist's works as an image on the dust-jacket of the new novel. Jacobs considers this a "startling" request, given Waugh's known antipathy to <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a>. Waugh probably had in mind one of Bacon's heads from the series generally referred to as the "screaming popes"—perhaps "<a href="Head%20VI">Head VI</a>", which Waugh may have seen at Bacon's 1949 exhibition at the <a href="Hanover%20Gallery">Hanover Gallery</a>. No such arrangement with the painter was possible. Waugh was dissatisfied with the illustration that the publishers finally produced, and on 17 June 1957 wrote to Ann Fleming complaining that McDougall had made "an ugly book of poor Pinfold".

The novel was published by Chapman and Hall in the UK on 19 July 1957, and by <a href="Little%2C%20Brown">Little, Brown</a> in the US on 12 August. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" had partly revealed the book's principal theme three months earlier: "The publishers hope to establish 'Pinfold' as a household word meaning 'half round the bend'." This comment followed closely on the release of <a href="Muriel%20Spark">Muriel Spark</a>'s first novel, "<a href="The%20Comforters">The Comforters</a>", which also dealt with issues of drug-induced hallucination. Although it would have been in Waugh's commercial interests to have ignored or downplayed Spark's book, he reviewed it generously in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" on 22 February 1957: "a complicated, subtle and, to me at least, an intensely interesting first novel".

A special edition of 50 copies of "Pinfold", on large paper, was prepared at Waugh's expense for presentation to his friends. The first <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin</a> paperback was issued in 1962, followed by numerous reissues in the following years, including a Penguin Modern Classic edition in 1999. It has also been translated into several languages.

On the day that "Pinfold" was published, Waugh was persuaded to attend a <a href="Foyle%27s%20Literary%20Luncheon">Foyle's Literary Luncheon</a>, as a means of promoting the book. He informed his audience that "Three years ago, I had quite a new experience. I went off my head for about three weeks". To further stimulate sales the dust-jacket also emphasised Waugh's experiences of madness, which brought him a large correspondence from strangers anxious to relate their own parallel experiences—"the voices ... of the persecuted, turning to him as confessor".
Waugh's friends were generally enthusiastic about the book. <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a> thought that it was one of Waugh's most interesting works, and <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> placed it among the writer's best fiction. The Donaldsons thought that he had "succeeded wonderfully" in providing so vivid an account of his experiences. <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, reviewing the book for "The Daily Telegraph", wrote: ""The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold" is self-examination written as a novel, but unlike other such works, which are generally dreary and self-pitying, this, because it is by Mr Waugh, is readable, thrilling and detached". Other reviewers were generally more circumspect. <a href="Philip%20Toynbee">Philip Toynbee</a> in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" found it "very hard to say whether it is a good book or not; it is certainly an interesting and a moving one". He sensed in Waugh's writing a "change of gear", a point picked up by John Raymond in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>". Raymond thought Waugh was the only current English novelist whose work showed signs of development, and that in "Pinfold" had produced "one of his wittiest, most humane entertainments", a work of self-revelation only marred, in Raymond's view, by an unsatisfactory conclusion. "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>"'s reviewer R. G. G. Price deemed it a "thin little tale", while acknowledging that Waugh as a comic writer could reasonably be compared with <a href="P.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BG.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> in terms of originality and humour.

<a href="Conor%20Cruise%20O%27Brien">Donat O'Donnell</a> in "The Spectator" was dismissive, calling the story "moderately interesting, almost entirely unfunny and a little embarrassing". On the book's autobiographical nature O'Donnell commented: "The Waugh of before "Brideshead" seldom wrote about himself; the Waugh of after "Brideshead" seldom writes about anything else". Reviewing the American edition in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Orville%20Prescott">Orville Prescott</a> found the book's central situation far too slight for a full-length novel; furthermore, "the reader's knowledge that the voices are delusions robs Mr Waugh's story of any narrative conflict or suspense ... Mr Pinfold's ordeal is neither humorous nor pathetic".

A few weeks after the book's publication, the novelist <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>, in a long essay in the "New Statesman" entitled "What Was Wrong With Pinfold", offered the theory that Waugh had been driven to the verge of madness not by an unfortunate cocktail of drugs but by his inability to reconcile his role as a writer with his desire to be a <a href="Squire%23Village%20leader">country squire</a>. He concluded: "Pinfold [Waugh] must step out of his role as the Cotswold gentleman quietly regretting the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Bill of 1832</a>, and if he cannot discover an accepted role as English man of letters ... he must create one." Waugh replied mockingly, drawing attention to Priestley's large land-holdings and surmising that "what gets Mr Priestley's goat (supposing that he allows such a deleterious animal in his lush pastures) is my attempt to behave as a gentleman".

Later opinions of the book, expressed by Waugh's eventual biographers, are mixed. Sykes considered the beginning to be one of the best pieces of autobiographical writing, but found the ending "weak & sentimental". Stannard, writing in 1984, did not consider the book a major work in the Waugh canon. Hastings in 1994, however, thought it "by any criteria an extraordinary work", and credited it with establishing Waugh's public image: "stout and splenetic, red-faced and reactionary". David Wykes (1999) considers that this "very controlled short novel" demonstrates that "Waugh was not very good at invention, but was unsurpassed at embroidery".

In 1960 Waugh accepted a fee of £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of "Pinfold", as a radio play, by <a href="Michael%20Bakewell">Michael Bakewell</a>. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did not listen to it. In September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by <a href="Ronald%20Harwood">Ronald Harwood</a> and directed by <a href="Michael%20Elliott%20%28director%29">Michael Elliott</a>, opened at the <a href="Royal%20Exchange%2C%20Manchester">Royal Exchange</a> theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the <a href="Roundhouse%20%28venue%29">Roundhouse Theatre</a> in February 1979, where <a href="Michael%20Hordern">Michael Hordern</a>'s depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering from chronic indigestion of the soul".

During 1962 Sykes was approached by the Russian-American composer <a href="Nicolas%20Nabokov">Nicolas Nabokov</a>, who was interested in making an opera from the Pinfold story on the basis of a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> provided by Sykes. Waugh gave his approval to the idea, and in March 1962 met with Nabokov. Discussions continued during the following months, before the project was abandoned in the summer.

Kit (association football)

In <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, kit (also referred to as a strip or uniform) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's <a href="Laws%20of%20the%20Game%20%28association%20football%29">Laws of the Game</a> specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of <a href="logo%23Sports">logos</a> displayed on shirts and stating that, in the event of a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to <a href="away%20colours">different coloured attire</a>.

Footballers generally wear identifying <a href="Squad%20number%20%28association%20football%29">numbers</a> on the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.

Football kit has evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a> and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for <a href="fan%20%28person%29">fans</a> to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.

The Laws of the Game set out the basic equipment which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment. Five separate items are specified: shirt (also known as a <a href="jersey%20%28clothing%29">jersey</a>), shorts, socks (also known as stockings), footwear and <a href="Shin%20guard">shin pads</a>. Goalkeepers are allowed to wear <a href="tracksuit%20bottoms">tracksuit bottoms</a> instead of shorts.

While most players wear studded <a href="football%20boot%23soccer%20shoe">football boots</a> ("soccer shoes" or "cleats" <a href="North%20American%20English">in North America</a>), the Laws do not specify that these are required. Shirts must have sleeves (both short and long sleeves are accepted), and <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28football%29">goalkeepers</a> must wear shirts which are easily distinguishable from all other players and the match officials. Thermal undershorts may be worn, but must be the same colour as the shorts themselves. Shin pads must be covered entirely by the stockings, be made of rubber, plastic or a similar material, and "provide a reasonable degree of protection". The only other restriction on equipment defined in the Laws of the Game is the requirement that a player "must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player".

It is normal for individual competitions to specify that all outfield players on a team must wear the same colours, though the Law states only "The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and also the referee and the assistant referees". In the event of a match between teams who would normally wear identical or similar colours the away team must change to a different colour. Because of this requirement a team's second-choice is often referred to as its <a href="away%20colours">"away kit" or "away colours"</a>, although it is not unknown, especially at international level, for teams to opt to wear their away colours even when not required to by a clash of colours, or to wear them at home. The <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a> sometimes plays in red shirts even when it is not required, as this was the strip worn when the team won the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a>. In some cases both teams have been forced to wear their second choice away kits; such as the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%23Second%20round">1974 FIFA World Cup</a> where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20B">2014 FIFA World Cup</a> where they wore dark blue and white rather than their home colors of orange and red, respectively.

Many professional clubs also have a <a href="Third%20jersey">"third kit"</a>, ostensibly to be used if both their first-choice and away colours are deemed too similar to those of an opponent. Most professional clubs have retained the same basic colour scheme for several decades, and the colours themselves form an integral part of a club's culture. Teams representing countries in international competition generally wear <a href="national%20colours">national colours</a> in common with other sporting teams of the same nation. These are usually based on the colours of the country's national flag, although there are exceptions—<a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">the Italian national team</a>, for example, wear blue as it was the colour of the <a href="House%20of%20Savoy">House of Savoy</a>, the Australian team like most Australian sporting teams wear the <a href="Australian%20National%20Colours">Australian National Colours</a> of green and gold, neither of which appear on the flag, and the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Dutch national team</a> wear orange, the colour of the <a href="House%20of%20Orange">Dutch Royal House</a>.
Shirts are normally made of a <a href="polyester">polyester</a> mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat in the same way as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above their number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify them as the captain to the referee and supporters.
Most current players wear specialist football boots, which can be made either of leather or a synthetic material. Modern boots are cut slightly below the ankles, as opposed to the high-ankled boots used in former times, and have studs attached to the soles. Studs may be either moulded directly to the sole or be detachable, normally by means of a screw thread. Modern boots such as the <a href="Adidas%20Predator">Adidas Predator</a>, originally designed by former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> player <a href="Craig%20Johnston">Craig Johnston</a>, feature increasingly intricate, scientifically aided designs and features such as air pockets in the soles and rubber "blades" on the sole rather than studs. The blades have been the subject of controversy as several top managers have blamed them for injuries both to opposition players and to the wearers themselves.

The Laws of the Game specify that all players, regardless of gender, must wear the same kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team <a href="Rakt">FC de Rakt</a> made international headlines by swapping its old strip for a new one featuring short skirts and tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Football%20Association">KNVB</a>, Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team were wearing hot pants under their skirts, and were therefore technically in compliance.

All players are permitted to wear gloves, and goalkeepers usually wear specialist goalkeeping gloves. Prior to the 1970s, gloves were rarely worn, but it is now extremely unusual to see a goalkeeper without gloves. In <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal's</a> match against <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a> tournament, <a href="Ricardo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Ricardo</a> drew much comment for deciding to remove his gloves during the <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>. Since the 1980s significant advancements have been made in the design of gloves, which now feature protectors to prevent the fingers bending backwards, segmentation to allow greater flexibility, and palms made of materials designed to protect the hand and to enhance a player's grip. Gloves are available in a variety of different cuts, including "flat palm", "roll finger" and "negative", with variations in the stitching and fit. Goalkeepers sometimes also wear caps to prevent <a href="Glare%20%28vision%29">glare</a> from the sun or floodlights affecting their performance. Players with sight problems may wear <a href="glasses">glasses</a> as long as there is no risk of them falling off or breaking and thereby becoming dangerous. Most players affected choose to wear <a href="contact%20lenses">contact lenses</a>, although Dutch player <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a>, unable to wear contact lenses due to <a href="glaucoma">glaucoma</a>, was known for his distinctive wraparound goggles. Other items that may be dangerous to other players, such as jewellery, however, are not allowed. Players may also choose to wear <a href="Association%20football%20headgear">headgear</a> to protect themselves from head injury as long as it presents no risk to the safety of the wearer or any other player.

<a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">Referees</a>, <a href="Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29">assistant referee</a>s and <a href="fourth%20official">fourth official</a>s wear kits of a similar style to that worn by players; until the 1950s it was more common for a referee to wear a <a href="blazer">blazer</a> than a jersey. Although not specified in the Laws of the Game, it is considered a principle of football that officials wear shirts of a different colour to those worn by the two teams and their goalkeepers. Black is the traditional colour worn by officials, and "the man in black" is widely used as an informal term for a referee, although increasingly other colours are being used in the modern era to minimise colour clashes. The <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994 World Cup</a> was the first in which FIFA allowed officials to wear colours other than black. In 1998 <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> referee <a href="David%20Elleray">David Elleray</a> was forced to change his black shirt for a white one midway through a match between <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a> as it was deemed too similar to the <a href="navy%20blue">navy blue</a> worn by the Wimbledon players. Referees also sometimes have sponsors' logos on their shirts, although these are normally confined to the sleeves.

The first written evidence of a clothing item specifically dedicated to football comes in 1526 from the <a href="Great%20Wardrobe">Great Wardrobe</a> of King <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a>, which included a reference to a pair of football boots. The earliest evidence of coloured shirts used to identify football teams comes from early <a href="English%20public%20school%20football%20games">English public school football games</a>, for example an image of <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a> football from before 1840 is entitled "The commoners have red and the college boys blue jerseys" and such colours are mentioned again in a "<a href="Bell%27s%20Life%20in%20London">Bell's Life in London</a>" article of 1858. House sporting colours are mentioned in <a href="Rugby%20football">Rugby football</a> (rule XXI) as early as 1845: "No player may wear cap or jersey without leave from the head of his house". In 1848 it was noted at Rugby that "considerable improvement has taken place in the last few years, in the appearance of a match... in the use of peculiar dress consisting of velvet caps and jerseys"

Organised association football was first played in England in the 1860s, and many teams would probably play in whatever clothing they had available, with players of the same team distinguishing themselves by wearing coloured caps or sashes. This came to be problematic though, and an 1867 handbook of the game suggested that teams should attempt "if it can be previously so arranged, to have one side with striped jerseys of one colour, say red, and the other with another, say blue. This prevents confusion and wild attempts to wrest the ball from your neighbour."
The first standard strips began to emerge in the 1870s, with many clubs opting for colours associated with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged. <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, for example, adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of <a href="Malvern%20College">Malvern College</a>, one of the schools where the sport had developed. Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to reflect an association with Cambridge University, where a number of the club's founders had been educated. Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches, with <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year. Rather than the modern shorts, players wore long <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a> or full-length trousers, often with a <a href="Belt%20%28clothing%29">belt</a> or even <a href="Suspenders">braces</a>. <a href="Arthur%20Kinnaird%2C%2011th%20Lord%20Kinnaird">Lord Kinnaird</a>, an early star of the game, was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers. There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players, and the programme for an 1875 match between <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.">Queen's Park</a> and <a href="Wanderers%20F.C.">Wanderers</a> in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings. The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> player <a href="Sam%20Weller%20Widdowson">Sam Weller Widdowson</a>, who cut down a pair of <a href="cricket">cricket</a> pads and wore them outside his stockings. Initially the concept was ridiculed but it soon caught on with other players. By the turn of the century pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings.

As the game gradually moved away from being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along with the need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.

Specialised football boots began to emerge in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.

As the game began to spread to Europe and beyond, clubs adopted kits similar to those worn in the United Kingdom, and in some cases chose colours directly inspired by British clubs. In 1903, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> of Italy adopted a black and white strip inspired by <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. Two years later, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>'s <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente">Club Atlético Independiente</a> adopted red shirts after watching <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> play.
In 1904 <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> dropped its rule that players' knickerbockers must cover their knees and teams began wearing them much shorter. They became known as "knickers", and were referred to by this term until the 1960s when "shorts" became the preferred term. Initially, almost all teams wore knickers of a contrasting colour to their shirts. In 1909, in a bid to assist referees in identifying the goalkeeper amongst a ruck of players, the Laws of the Game were amended to state that the goalkeeper must wear a shirt of a different colour to their team-mates. Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it caught on to the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green. In this period goalkeepers generally wore a heavy woollen garment more akin to a <a href="Sweater">jumper</a> than the shirts worn by outfield players.

Sporadic experiments with numbered shirts took place in the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on. The first major match in which numbers were worn was the <a href="1933%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1933 FA Cup Final</a> between <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs' existing strips, two special sets, one white and one red, were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin. The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22. It was not until around the time of the Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team's main <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a>. In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches. The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe were wearing boots which weighed only a third of the weight of the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.
In the period immediately after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club, and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s <a href="Clyde%20F.C.">Clyde</a> wore <a href="khaki">khaki</a>. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> in 1954. Although they cost twice as much as existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">FC Dynamo Moscow</a> team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, the southern European style spread to the rest of the continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.

In the 1970s clubs began to create strongly individual strips, and in 1975 <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, who had changed their traditional blue and gold colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to <a href="fan%20%28person%29">fans</a> in the form of <a href="throwback%20uniform">replicas</a>. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' <a href="logo%23Sports">logos</a> and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> signed a deal with local alcohol producer <a href="J%C3%A4germeister">Jägermeister</a> to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a> received €25 million in sponsorship money from <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a>. However Spanish clubs <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> and <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 <a href="Johan%20Cruijff">Johan Cruijff</a> refused to wear the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Dutch national team's</a> strip as its <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> branding conflicted with his own individual contract with <a href="Puma%20AG">Puma</a>, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces at the start of the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970 FIFA World Cup</a> final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.
In the 1980s manufacturers such as <a href="hummel%20International">Hummel</a> and <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> began to design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology led to the introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Danish national team</a> for the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 FIFA World Cup</a> caused a stir in the media but <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> worried about <a href="moir%C3%A9%20pattern">moiré artefacts</a> in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the <a href="1991%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1991 FA Cup Final</a> <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur's</a> players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the <a href="International%20Football%20Association%20Board">International Football Association Board</a> in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.
The market for replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue generated for leading clubs and the frequency with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m. Several clubs have been accused of <a href="price%20fixing">price fixing</a>, and in 2003 <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> were fined £1.65m by the <a href="Office%20of%20Fair%20Trading">Office of Fair Trading</a>. The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying <a href="Counterfeit%20consumer%20goods%23Apparel%20and%20accessories">fake shirts</a> which are imported from countries such as <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>.

The chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>'s transfer to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name. A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> in the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970 FIFA World Cup</a> Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.

A number of advances in kit design have taken place since 2000, with varying degrees of success. In 2002 the <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon national team</a> competed in the <a href="African%20Cup%20of%20Nations">African Cup of Nations</a> in Mali wearing shirts with no sleeves, but <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> later ruled that such garments were not considered to be shirts and therefore were not permitted under the Laws of the Game. Manufacturers <a href="Puma%20AG">Puma AG</a> initially added "invisible" black sleeves to comply with the ruling, but later supplied the team with new one-piece <a href="sleeveless%20shirt">singlet</a>-style tops. FIFA ordered the team not to wear the tops but the ruling was disregarded, with the result that the Cameroon team was docked six points in its qualifying campaign for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, a decision later reversed after an appeal. More successful were the skin-tight shirts designed for the <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italian national team</a> by manufacturers <a href="Kappa%20%28company%29">Kappa</a>, a style subsequently emulated by other national teams and club sides.

A brief fashion for men wearing <a href="Snood%20%28headgear%29">snood-scarf</a> neckwarmers ended in 2011 when the IFAB banned them as potentially dangerous. A ban on women wearing the <a href="hijab">hijab</a> was introduced by the IFAB in 2007, but lifted in 2012 after pressure from <a href="Prince%20Ali%20Bin%20Al-Hussein">Prince Ali of Jordan</a>. In keeping with <a href="Islamic%20scarf%20controversy%20in%20France">French views</a>, the <a href="French%20Football%20Federation">French Football Federation</a> said it would maintain its ban.
