Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell

Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a> by British writer <a href="Susanna%20Clarke">Susanna Clarke</a>. Published in 2004, it is an <a href="alternate%20history">alternative history</a> set in 19th-century England around the time of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Its premise is that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centred on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of "Englishness" and the boundaries between reason and unreason, <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="Danelaw">Anglo-Dane</a>, and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes/stereotypes. It has been described as a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> novel, an alternative history, and a historical novel. It inverts the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> conception of the <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20divide%20%28England%29">North-South divide in England</a>: in this book the North is romantic and magical, rather than rational and concrete.

The narrative draws on various <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> literary traditions, such as the <a href="comedy%20of%20manners">comedy of manners</a>, the <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic tale</a>, and the <a href="Byronic%20hero">Byronic hero</a>. The novel's language is a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of 19th-century writing styles, such as those of <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.

Clarke began writing "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" in 1992; ten years later she submitted the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by <a href="Bloomsbury%20Publishing">Bloomsbury</a> and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were so sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" best-seller list</a>. It was longlisted for the 2004 <a href="Booker%20Prize">Man Booker Prize</a> and won the 2005 <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a>.

The novel opens in 1806 in <a href="northern%20England">northern England</a> with The Learned Society of <a href="York">York</a> Magicians, whose members are "theoretical magicians" who believe that magic died out several hundred years earlier. The group is stunned to learn of a "practical magician", Mr Gilbert Norrell, who owns a large collection of "books of magic", which he has spent years purchasing to keep them out of the hands of others. Norrell proves his skill as a magician by making the statues in <a href="York%20Minster">York Cathedral</a> speak. John Childermass, Mr Norrell's servant, convinces a member of the group, John Segundus, to write about the event for the London newspapers.

Segundus's article generates considerable interest in Mr Norrell, who moves to London to revive practical English magic. He enters society with the help of two gentlemen about town and meets a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> Minister, Sir Walter Pole. To ingratiate himself, Mr Norrell attempts to recall Sir Walter's fiancée, Emma Wintertowne, from the dead. He summons a fairy—"the gentleman with thistle-down hair"—who strikes a bargain with Mr Norrell to restore Emma: half of her life will be spent with the fairy. After news spreads of Emma's resurrection and happy marriage to Sir Walter, magic becomes seen as respectable; and Mr Norrell uses his magic to aid the government in their <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">ongoing war</a> against <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>.
While living in London, Mr Norrell encounters Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, and recites the same prophecy, which prompts Strange to become a magician. Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, and promises to make him a king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into <a href="lassitude">lassitude</a>. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.

Volume II opens in 1809 with Strange learning of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him. They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass (the legendary Raven King) to English magic. Strange argues that "without the Raven King there would be no magic and no magicians" while Norrell retorts that the Raven King abandoned England and should be forgotten. Despite their differing opinions and temperaments, Strange becomes Norrell's pupil. Norrell, however, deliberately keeps some knowledge from Strange.

The Stranges become a popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative. The Cabinet ministers find Strange easier to deal with than Norrell, and they send him to assist the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> on his <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular Campaign</a>. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>'s madness, although Strange manages to save the king from the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>.

Upon returning to England, Strange finds that one of Norrell's men, socialite Christopher Drawlight, has been stealing money from eager English citizens with prospects of fulfilling their wishes through Strange's magic. Drawlight disappears and is arrested by his former friend, Henry Lascelles. Norrell strongly wishes for Drawlight to be hanged for his crime, but Strange disagrees. Lascelles starts to become closer to Norrell, challenging the relationship between Childermass and his master.

Frustrated with being Norrell's pupil, Strange pens a scathing review of a book outlining Norrell's theories on modern magic; in particular, Strange challenges Norrell's views of the Raven King. The English public splits into "Norrellites" and "Strangites"; Norrell and Strange part company, although not without regret. Strange returns home and works on his own book, "The History and Practice of English Magic". Arabella goes missing, then suddenly reappears, sick and weak. Three days later she dies.

Volume III opens in 1816 with Lady Pole attempting to shoot Mr Norrell. Childermass takes the bullet himself but is not killed. Afterwards, Lady Pole is cared for in the country by John Segundus, who has an inkling of the magic surrounding her. During travels in the north, Stephen meets Vinculus, who recites his prophecy: ""the nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country" ... " Stephen believes it applies to him, but the gentleman with thistle-down hair argues that it applies to the Raven King.

Strange travels to Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond of each other and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with dangerous magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost-Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to <a href="Padua">Padua</a> and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice to find out more about Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.

Drawlight attempts to deliver the messages to their recipients, but is intercepted by Lascelles, who murders him, as Norrell learning the truth would damage Lascelles' control over Norrell. Strange, bringing the "Eternal Night" with him, asks Norrell to help him undo Arabella's enchantment by summoning John Uskglass. With the "Eternal Night" at Hurtfew, Lascelles becomes trapped in a fairy road forever.

Childermass meanwhile eventually receives the message meant for him by Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistle-down hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. "En route", he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England to pay homage to John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the "nameless slave". However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his momentary control of all English magic to destroy the man with the thistle-down hair. Then, leaving England forever by one of the newly opened Faerie roads, Stephen becomes the new king of the now-blossoming Lost-Hope.

Childermass discovers Vinculus's body and notes that it is tattooed with the last work of John Uskglass. As he tries to preserve the tattoos in memory, a man appears. He calls Childermass his servant (giving him the misapprehension that it is Norrell in disguise), then brings Vinculus back to life and performs other feats of magic with ease. The mysterious man, heavily implied to be John Uskglass himself, then disappears, removing Childermass's and Vinculus's memories of the encounter as he goes.

As a result of the imprecision of the fairy's curse, which was placed on "the English magician", Norrell is trapped along with Strange in the "Eternal Night", and they cannot move more than a certain distance from each other. Upon the gentleman with the thistle-down hair's death, Arabella comes through the mirror in Padua, where Flora is waiting for her upon instruction of Strange. Childermass informs The Learned Society of York Magicians that their contract is void, telling them they can study magic again. He shows the now-restored Vinculus as proof that John Uskglass's book of magic remains, tattooed upon his body. Two months later, Strange has a conversation with Arabella, who is still living in Padua, and explains that he and Norrell are working to undo the eternal darkness they are both trapped in, but are planning to adventure into other worlds. Neither wishes to take her to Faerie again, so he instead promises to return to her when he has dispelled the darkness and tells her not to be a widow till then, which she agrees to.

Clarke first developed the idea for "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" during a year spent teaching English in <a href="Bilbao%2C%20Spain">Bilbao, Spain</a>: "I had a kind of waking dream ... about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background – he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong." She had also recently re-read <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and afterwards was inspired to "trying writing a novel of magic and fantasy".

After she returned from Spain in 1993, Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel. She signed up for a five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by writers <a href="Colin%20Greenland">Colin Greenland</a> and <a href="Geoff%20Ryman">Geoff Ryman</a>. The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending, but Clarke only had "bundles" of material for her novel. From this she extracted "<a href="The%20Ladies%20of%20Grace%20Adieu%20and%20Other%20Stories">The Ladies of Grace Adieu</a>", a story about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange. Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>. Gaiman later said, "It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance ... It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata." Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor <a href="Patrick%20Nielsen%20Hayden">Patrick Nielsen Hayden</a>. Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology "<a href="Starlight%20%28anthology%20series%29">Starlight 1</a>", which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted, and the book won the <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Award">World Fantasy Award</a> for best anthology in 1997.

Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks full-time for <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. She also published stories in "Starlight 2" and "Starlight 3"; according to the "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">New York Times Magazine</a>", her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30 am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not the reader, "clung to this method" because "I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [the novel] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." Clarke and Greenland moved in together while she was writing the novel. Greenland did not read the novel until it was published.

Around 2001, Clarke "had begun to despair", and started looking for someone to help her finish and sell the book. Giles Gordon became her agent and sold the unfinished manuscript to <a href="Bloomsbury%20Publishing">Bloomsbury</a> in early 2003, after two publishers rejected it as unmarketable. Bloomsbury were so sure the novel would be a success that they offered Clarke a £1 million advance. They printed 250,000 hardcover copies simultaneously in the United States, Britain, and Germany. Seventeen translations were begun before the first English publication was released. "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" was first published in the United States on 8 September 2004, in the United Kingdom on 30 September, and in other countries on 4 October.

Clarke's style has frequently been described as a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, and <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith</a>. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including <a href="sycophant">sycophant</a>s, <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rakes</a>, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for "<a href="salon.com">Salon</a>", suggests that the novel is "about a certain <a href="Writer%27s%20voice">literary voice</a>, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th-century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—"chuse" for "choose" and "shewed" for "showed", for example—to convey this voice as well as the <a href="free%20indirect%20speech">free indirect speech</a> made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly "chat" about magic" where Dickens's is prominent "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for "<a href="The%20Weekly%20Standard">The Weekly Standard</a>" that "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.

In "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell", Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, the narrator notes: "It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." As <a href="Michel%20Faber">Michel Faber</a> explains in his review for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." <a href="Gregory%20Maguire">Gregory Maguire</a> notes in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: "[A gentleman] picks up a book and begins to read ... but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel – the sort of work which above all others he most despises – and he puts it down in disgust." Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.

Clarke's style extends to the novel's 185 footnotes, which document a meticulous invented history of English magic. At times, the footnotes dominate entire pages of the novel. Michael Dirda, in his review for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", describes these notes as "dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship", in which the anonymous narrator "provides elaborate mini-essays, relating anecdotes from the lives of semi-legendary magicians, describing strange books and their contents, speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King". This extensive extra-textual apparatus is reminiscent of <a href="postmodernist">postmodernist</a> works, such as <a href="David%20Foster%20Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>'s "<a href="Infinite%20Jest">Infinite Jest</a>" (1996) and <a href="Thomas%20Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>'s "<a href="Mason%20%26amp%3B%20Dixon">Mason & Dixon</a>" (1997), particularly as Clarke's notes humorously refer to previous notes in the novel. Clarke did not expect her publisher to accept the footnotes.

Feeley explains that <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>'s "vision of enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with "faeries"" informs the novel, as the passing reference to the "cold hillside" makes clear. The magic in "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" has been described as "wintry and sinister" and "a melancholy, macabre thing". There are "flocks of black birds, a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice, a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors, a phantom bell that makes people think of everything they have ever lost, a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes". The <a href="setting%20%28narrative%29">setting</a> reflects this tone, as "dark, fog, mist and wet give the book much of its creepy, northern atmosphere." According to Nisi Shawl in her review for "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>", the illustrations reinforce this tenor: "Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg, as apt as <a href="Edward%20Gorey">Edward Gorey</a>'s for Dickens' '<a href="Bleak%20House">Bleak House</a>'." Author <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> disagrees, arguing that they are "astonishingly inappropriate" to the tone of the novel. Noting that Clarke refers to important nineteenth-century illustrators <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>, whose works are "line-dominated, intricate, scabrous, cartoon-like, savage and funny", he is disappointed with the "soft and wooden" illustrations provided by Rosenberg.

Reviewers variously describe "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" as a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> novel, an <a href="alternate%20history">alternative history</a>, a <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>, or as a combination of these styles. Clarke herself says, "I think the novel is viewed as something new ... blending together a few genres – such as fantasy and adventure and pastiche historical – plus there's the whole thing about slightly knowing footnotes commenting on the story." She explains in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of <a href="Rosemary%20Sutcliff">Rosemary Sutcliff</a> as well as the fantasies of <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> and <a href="Alan%20Garner">Alan Garner</a>, and that she loves the works of Austen.

In his review for "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", John Freeman observes that Clarke's fantasy, like that of <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> and <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, is imbued with <a href="Literary%20realism">realism</a>. He argues that the footnotes in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell's house are located. In an interview, Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy: "One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps, carriages and how difficult it is to get good servants." To create this effect, the novel includes many references to real early-nineteenth century people and things, such as: artists <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; writers <a href="Frances%20Burney">Frances Burney</a>, <a href="William%20Thomas%20Beckford">William Beckford</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Lewis%20%28writer%29">Monk Lewis</a>, <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, and <a href="Ann%20Radcliffe">Ann Radcliffe</a>; <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>'s "<a href="Belinda%20%28Edgeworth%20novel%29">Belinda</a>" and Austen's "<a href="Emma%20%28novel%29">Emma</a>"; publisher <a href="John%20Murray%20%281778%E2%80%931843%29">John Murray</a>; politicians <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Viscount%20Castlereagh">Lord Castlereagh</a> and <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a>; "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" and "<a href="Edinburgh%20Review">The Edinburgh Review</a>"; <a href="Thomas%20Chippendale">Chippendale</a> and <a href="Wedgwood">Wedgwood</a> furnishings; and the madness of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>. Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin's <a href="Earthsea">Earthsea</a> trilogy. This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke's book is more of an historical fiction, akin to the works of <a href="Patrick%20O%27Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a>. As she explains, "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape." Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.

As well as literary styles, Clarke pastiches many <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> literary genres: the <a href="comedy%20of%20manners">comedy of manners</a>, the <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic tale</a>, the <a href="Fashionable%20novel">silver-fork novel</a>, the military adventure, the <a href="Byronic%20hero">Byronic hero</a>, and the historical romance of <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>. In fact, Clarke's novel maps the literary history of the early nineteenth century: the novel begins with the style and genres of <a href="British%20Regency">Regency England</a>, an "Austenian world of light, bright, sparkling dialogue and well-mannered gentility", and gradually transforms into a dark, <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byronic</a> tale. Clarke combines these Romantic genres with modern ones, such as the fantasy novel, drawing on the works of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, <a href="Philip%20Pullman">Philip Pullman</a>, <a href="T.%20H.%20White">T. H. White</a>, and <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>. As Maguire notes, Clarke includes rings of power and books of spells that originate in these authors' works. In contrast, Sacha Zimmerman suggests in "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" that while Tolkien's world is "entirely new", Clarke's world is more engaging because it is eerily close to the reader's. Although many reviewers compare "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" to the <a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a> series, Annie Linskey contends in "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" that "the allusion is misleading": unlike <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>'s novels, Clarke's is morally ambiguous, with its complex plot and dark characters.

Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel is about their relationship. In her review for the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>", Roz Kaveney writes that the two illustrate <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a>'s notion of the "<a href="The%20Anxiety%20of%20Influence">anxiety of influence</a>" in addition to <a href="romantic%20friendship">romantic friendship</a>. The two are a "study in contrasts", with Norrell "exceptionally learned but shy and fussy" while Strange is "charming, young, fashionable and romantic". As one reviewer remarks, "Clarke could have called the book "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a>" if the title weren't already taken."

The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason—and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness (mad people can see fairies, for example). Lady Pole, who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost-Hope every night, appears insane to those around her. She is hidden away, like the character type examined by <a href="Sandra%20Gilbert">Sandra Gilbert</a> and <a href="Susan%20Gubar">Susan Gubar</a> in their seminal book "<a href="The%20Madwoman%20in%20the%20Attic">The Madwoman in the Attic</a>" (1979). Developing a "divided consciousness", she is passive and quiet at home at the same time she is vengeful and murderous in the fairy land.

Clarke's book is identified as distinctively English not only because of its style but also because of its themes of "vigorous common sense", "firm ethical fiber", "serene reason and self-confidence", which are drawn from its <a href="Augustan%20literature">Augustan literary</a> roots. The "muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies" is equally a part of its Englishness, along with "arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice". The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English; she alludes to tales from children's literature and others which date back to the medieval period. As Feeley notes, "The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Spenser</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland." In these medieval English stories, the fairies are depicted as "capricious, inconsistent in their attitude toward humankind, [and] finally unknowable", characteristics which Clarke integrates into her own fairies. Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable, amoral fairies from the works of <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>.

In an interview with "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>", Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of "Englishness" into "Jonathan Strange": "I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, as well as my ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape. ... Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">Chesterton</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Conan Doyle</a>, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible about the rest of the world", which connects Conan Doyle's <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.

Using techniques of the genre of alternative history, Clarke creates events and characters that would have been impossible in the early nineteenth century. She also explores the "silencing" of under-represented groups: women, people of colour, and poor whites. Both Strange and Norrell suppress the voices of these groups in their rise to power. Mr Norrell, for example, attempts to buy up all the books of magic in England to keep anyone else from acquiring their knowledge. He also barters away half of Emma Wintertowne's (Lady Pole's) life for political influence, a deal about which, due to an enchantment, she cannot speak coherently.

Clarke explores the limits of "English" magic through the characters of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, "If you put a fairy next to a person who is also outside English society ... suddenly the fact that there is this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way." The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a <a href="noble%20savage">noble savage</a> and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>.

To promote "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell", Bloomsbury—who also published the Harry Potter series—launched what "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called "one of the biggest marketing campaigns in publishing history". Their campaign included plans for newspaper serialisations, book deliveries by horse and carriage, and the placement of "themed teasers", such as period stationery and mock newspapers, in United States coffeeshops. 7,500 advance readers' copies were sent out, a limited number wrapped in paper and sealed with wax. These sold for more than US$100 each on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> in England in the weeks leading up to publication. By 2005, collectors were paying hundreds of <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds</a> for signed copies of a limited edition of the novel.

The book debuted at No. 9 on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" best-seller list</a>, rising to No. 3 two weeks later. It remained on the list for eleven weeks. Four weeks after the book's initial publication, it was in <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon's</a> top ten. Clarke went on a 20-city tour to promote the novel, after its near-simultaneous publication in 20 countries. Endorsements from independent booksellers helped the book sell out its first printing; by the end of September 2004, it had gone through eight printings.

The novel met with "a crackle of favorable reviews in major papers". "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" hailed it as "an exceptional work", both "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" described Clarke as "a superb character writer", and the "<a href="Denver%20Post">Denver Post</a>" called her a "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's "deft" handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" complaining that "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Weekly">Science Fiction Weekly</a>", Clute suggested that "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately "trimmed"" (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone gets in the way of plot development. On the other hand, "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" found the novel "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reviewer noted, with others, that "sex plays virtually no role in the story ... [and] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" reviewer, <a href="Amanda%20Craig">Amanda Craig</a>, praised the novel as "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen – or, perhaps, by the young <a href="Ann%20Radcliffe">Mrs Radcliffe</a>, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." However, she also criticised the book: "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than <a href="Morgan%20le%20Fay">Morgan le Fay</a> is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>":

What keeps this densely realised confection aloft is that very quality of reverence to the writers of the past. The chief character in "Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell" isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and to add to the literature.

While promoting the novel, <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> said that it was "unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years", a statement which has most often been read <a href="hyperbole">hyperbolically</a>. However, as Clute explains, what Gaiman meant was that "Jonathan Strange" is "the finest "English" novel of the fantastic since <a href="Hope%20Mirrlees">Hope Mirrlees</a>'s great "<a href="Lud-in-the-Mist">Lud-in-the-Mist</a>" (1926), which is almost certainly the finest "English" fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published" (emphasis in original). Clute writes that "a more cautious claim" would be: "if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in "Strange" ... she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published, bar none of the above, including Mirrlees."

On 15 October 2004, <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> announced that it had bought a three-year <a href="option%20%28filmmaking%29">option</a> on the film rights to "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell". Clarke received an undisclosed "seven-figure sum", making the deal "one of the biggest acquisitions of film rights for a book in recent years". New Line chose <a href="Christopher%20Hampton">Christopher Hampton</a>, whose adaptation of "<a href="Dangerous%20Liaisons">Dangerous Liaisons</a>" won an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, to write it; New Line executives <a href="Mark%20Ordesky">Mark Ordesky</a> and <a href="Ileen%20Maisel">Ileen Maisel</a> were overseeing the production. On 7 November 2005, "The Daily Telegraph" reported that Hampton had finished the first draft: "As you can imagine, it took a fair amount of time to work out some way to encapsulate that enormous book in a film of sensible length ... [b]ut it was lots of fun – and very unlike anything I have ever done before." At that time, no director or cast had yet been chosen. As of June 2006, Hampton was still working on the screenplay. <a href="Julian%20Fellowes">Julian Fellowes</a> then took over writing duties before the collapse of New Line Cinema.

A seven-part adaptation of the book by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> began broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on Sunday 17 May 2015. The book was adapted by <a href="Peter%20Harness">Peter Harness</a>, directed by <a href="Toby%20Haynes">Toby Haynes</a>, and produced by <a href="Cuba%20Pictures">Cuba Pictures</a> and Feel Films. A number of co-producers joined the project, including <a href="BBC%20America">BBC America</a>, <a href="Screen%20Yorkshire">Screen Yorkshire</a>, <a href="Space%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29">Space</a> and Far Moor, and it is to be distributed by <a href="Endemol%20Worldwide%20Distribution">Endemol Worldwide Distribution</a>.

Pre-production began in April 2013, and filming later in the year, including locations in Yorkshire and Canada.

The 32-hour audio book of "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" was released by <a href="Audio%20Renaissance">Audio Renaissance</a> in 2004. According to a review in "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", reader <a href="Simon%20Prebble">Simon Prebble</a> "navigates this production with much assuredness and an array of accents. ... Prebble's full voice is altered to a delicate softness for young ladies of a certain breeding, or tightened to convey the snarkiness often heard in the costive Norrell." Prebble interrupts the main text to read the footnotes, announcing them with the word "footnote". According to the "AudioFile" review, the "narrative flow suffers" because of these interruptions and the reviewer recommends listening "with text in hand". Each note is on its own track, so listeners have the option of skipping them without missing text from the main narrative. When doing public readings, Clarke herself skips the notes.

In 2004, Clarke announced that she was working on a book that begins a few years after "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell" ends. It is intended to centre on characters such as Childermass and Vinculus who, as Clarke says, are "a bit lower down the social scale". She commented in 2005 and 2007 that progress on the book had been slowed by her ill health. In 2006 it was reported that she suffered from <a href="chronic%20fatigue%20syndrome">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>.

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Bethesda%20Game%20Studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and published by <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a> and the <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> division <a href="2K%20Games">2K Games</a>. It is the fourth installment in "<a href="The%20Elder%20Scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a>" action <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> series, following "" and preceding "". The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="Xbox%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B360">Xbox 360</a> in March 2006, and on <a href="PlayStation%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3">PlayStation 3</a> in March 2007, with a mobile version of the game released on May 2, 2006. Taking place within the fictional province of Cyrodiil, "Oblivion"s main story revolves around the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>'s efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the "Mythic Dawn" that plans to open <a href="portal%20%28fiction%29">portal gates</a> to a demonic realm known as "Oblivion". The game continues the <a href="open%20world">open world</a> tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the <a href="game%20world">game world</a> at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Early in the game, seven skills are selected by the player as major skills for their character, with those remaining termed as minor skills.

"Oblivion" is a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> (RPG) that incorporates <a href="open%20world">open-ended</a> gameplay. The player can follow side-quests, interact with NPCs, dispatch monsters, develop their character, and travel anywhere in the province of Cyrodiil at any time while playing the game (provided that the areas are not quest-specific and otherwise inaccessible when not questing). The game never ends, and the player can continue playing after completing the main quest. The gameplay includes a "fast travel" system, in which an icon appears on the game world map every time the player visits a new location. This excludes the game world's main cities which are already unlocked for fast travel from the start of the game. The player can arrive at the desired location instantaneously by selecting the icon on the map.
Character development is a primary element of "Oblivion". At the beginning of the game, players select one of many humanoid or <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> races, each of which has different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas.

Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. The players <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">level up</a> each time they improve their major skills by a total of ten points; this provides the opportunity to improve their <a href="attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">attributes</a>. Attributes are more broad character qualities, such as "speed" and "endurance", while skills are more specific, such as "armorer" or "athletics". Afflictions such as disease and poison can reduce the player's attributes. When players reach 25, 50, 75, or 100 points in a single skill, they unlock new abilities related to the skill.

The game's 21 skills fall evenly under the categories of combat, magic, and stealth, and many skills complement more than one area. Combat skills are used primarily for battle and incorporate armor and heavy weapons like blades, axes, maces, and hammers. Magic skills rely on the use of <a href="spell%20%28magic%29">spell</a>s to alter the physical world, to affect the minds of others, to injure and debilitate enemies, to summon monsters to help fight, and to heal wounds. Stealth skills allow the player to crack locks, haggle for goods, use speech to manipulate people, and apply cunning in combat (through the use of a bow or with a sneak attack). The spells, weapons, and other tools such that a player needs to employ and enhance these skills, such as <a href="lock%20picking">lockpick</a>s, can be purchased in shops, stolen from NPCs, or found as loot on the bodies of foes or in dungeons.

"Oblivion" can be played in either a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first</a>- or <a href="third-person%20view">third-person view</a>, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in <a href="Isometric%20graphics%20in%20video%20games%20and%20pixel%20art">isometric projection</a>. The player may change the level of difficulty at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a>, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.

Health can be restored by spells, potions, or resting; the loss of all health results in death. Magicka enables and is depleted by the use of spells; it is rejuvenated naturally over time, but it can be restored similarly to health. Fatigue affects the character's effectiveness in combat and general efficiency, and can be alleviated by resting, potions, and spells.

Throughout the world are a variety of enemies, including standard fantasy monsters such as <a href="imp">imp</a>s and <a href="goblin">goblin</a>s, and animals such as bears and wolves. Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up. This game mechanic of level-scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty. However, level-scaling combined with the leveling system has received criticism, as it has the potential to unbalance the game; characters with major skills that increase on an involuntary basis, such as athletics or armor, can find that they level too quickly, making the enemies proportionately harder than intended.

"Oblivion" is set six years after the events of "", though it is not a direct sequel to it or any other game. The game is set in Cyrodiil—a province of Tamriel, the continent on which all the games in the series have so far taken place.

The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown crime. Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as "the Blades", arrive in the prison, fleeing from assassins who have murdered the emperor's three sons and are now targeting him. The emperor and the Blades reveal that the player's jail cell contains a secret entrance to a part of the city's sewer that functions as an escape route. Pardoned by the emperor, the player follows the group into the sewer, where they come under attack by assassins. All but one of the Blades are cut down in the fighting that ensues. Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins, Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player to take it to a man named Jauffre, the grand master of the Blades, at Weynon Priory. Immediately afterward, one of the assassins kills the emperor. The player escapes the sewer and heads out into the open world of Cyrodiil.

The lack of an heir for Uriel Septim has broken an old <a href="covenant%20%28religion%29">covenant</a>—the barrier to Oblivion: a dangerous realm that is in another dimension. Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player that the only way to close the gates permanently is to find someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial City. However, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch, the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the planes of Oblivion—in order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Martin has survived and the player persuades him to come to Weynon Priory.

The player, now recognized as the Hero of Kvatch, returns to Weynon Priory with Martin, finding that it has come under attack by assassins and that the Amulet of Kings has been stolen. The player escorts Jauffre and Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple, the stronghold of the Blades. There, Martin is recognized as the emperor and is given command of the Blades. The player is optionally entered into their ranks and sets off in search of the amulet. After gathering information, the player learns that the group responsible for Uriel Septim's assassination and the theft of the amulet are the Mythic Dawn, a cult dedicated to the worshiping of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction. The cult believes Dagon is the true creator of the world and wish for him to "cleanse" it of all impurities. Killing the emperor and thus removing the barriers to Oblivion was the first step in realizing this idea. The player attempts to infiltrate the secret meeting place of the cult in the hopes of retrieving the amulet. When the player does so, the cult's leader, Mankar Camoran, escapes through a portal, taking the amulet with him. The player takes the book that had opened the portal to Martin, who deduces a way to reopen the portal. The player seeks out three key artifacts necessary to recreate the portal: a Daedric artifact, The Blood of the Divines, in this case the armor of the first Septim emperor is a substitute, and a Great Welkynd Stone. With all three retrieved, Martin reveals that a final ingredient is needed: a Great Sigil Stone from inside a Great Gate similar to the one that devastated Kvatch. Martin and Jauffre decide to allow the city of Bruma to be attacked by Daedra so that a Great Gate will be opened. Once it is, the player obtains the Stone and closes the Gate, also saving Bruma.

A portal is created at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After bypassing Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently travel to the Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight their way to the Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.

The game was developed by the United States <a href="software%20industry">software company</a> <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a>. <a href="Ken%20Rolston">Ken Rolston</a>, who was "Morrowind"s lead designer, oversaw the development team. The PC and Xbox 360 versions of the game were co-published by <a href="2K%20Games">2K Games</a> and Bethesda. Work on "Oblivion" began shortly after the release of "Morrowind" in 2002. By mid-September 2004, "Oblivion" had been officially announced, and its title revealed.

During "Oblivion"s development, Bethesda concentrated on creating a system with a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had been done in the past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved <a href="artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary <a href="Radiant%20AI">Radiant A.I.</a> software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> <a href="physics%20engine">physics engine</a>. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as <a href="high-dynamic-range%20rendering">high-dynamic-range rendering</a> (HDR) and <a href="specularity">specular mapping</a>. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of "Oblivion"s terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.
While designing "Oblivion"s landscape and architecture, developers worked from personal travel photographs, nature books, texture images, and reference photographs. Procedural content generation tools used in production allowed for the creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with "Morrowind". Erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed for the creation of craggy terrain quickly and easily, replacing "Morrowind"s artificially smoothed-over terrain.

"Oblivion"s <a href="draw%20distance">view distance</a> is far greater than its predecessor's, extending player sightlines to the horizon and giving views of distant towns and mountain ranges. According to a Microsoft press release, "Oblivion"s game world is approximately 16 square miles (41 square kilometers) in size. Wilderness quests, ruins, and dungeons were added to fill surplus space. Content in the dungeons is more densely packed than in dungeons in "Morrowind", with an increase in the frequency of creature encounters, quest-related NPCs, and puzzles. The populations represented in "Oblivion", however, do not match the "thousands upon thousands" described in previous in-game literature. The development team decided to set the NPC populations at a level that would play well, rather than one that would match game lore, since the presence of a large number of NPCs on screen would have caused the game to slow down.

In response to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in "Morrowind", Bethesda developed the Radiant AI system for "Oblivion". NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity and if it is in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.

"Oblivion" features the voices of <a href="Patrick%20Stewart">Patrick Stewart</a>, <a href="Lynda%20Carter">Lynda Carter</a>, <a href="Sean%20Bean">Sean Bean</a>, <a href="Terence%20Stamp">Terence Stamp</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Cosham">Ralph Cosham</a>, and <a href="Wes%20Johnson">Wes Johnson</a>, with celebrity acquisition and voice production being handled by <a href="Blindlight">Blindlight</a>. The voice acting received mixed reviews in the gaming press. While many publications praised it as excellent, others found fault with its repetitiveness. The issue has been blamed on the small number of voice actors and the blandness of the dialogue itself. Lead designer Ken Rolston found the plan to fully voice the game "less flexible, less apt for user projection of his own tone, more constrained for branching, and more trouble for production and disk real estate" than "Morrowind"s partially recorded dialogue. Rolston tempered his criticism with the suggestion that voice acting "can be a powerful expressive tool" and can contribute significantly to the charm and ambience of the game. He stated "I prefer "Morrowind"s partially recorded dialogue, for many reasons. But I'm told that voiced dialogue is what the kids want".

"Oblivion"s score was composed by series mainstay <a href="Jeremy%20Soule">Jeremy Soule</a>, a video game composer whose past scores had earned him a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) award in the "<a href="British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">Game Music Category</a>" and two nominations for an <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> (AIAS) award for "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to "Oblivion", featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes, was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and <a href="Todd%20Howard%20%28video%20game%20designer%29">Todd Howard</a> during the creation of "Morrowind", and, in a press release announcing his return for "Oblivion", Soule repeated the words he had said during "Morrowind"s press release: "The stunning, epic quality of "The Elder Scrolls" series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for "Morrowind", Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score so as not to wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came as a result of a car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.

"Oblivion"s public debut occurred on May 18, 2005, at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)</a> in Los Angeles. The version shown at E3 was substantially finished; most content was already in the game, lacking only the polish that the final months of development would bring. Most viewers were impressed by Oblivion's showing, and the game won a number of "best of" awards from a variety of game journalists: <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s "RPG Game of Show", <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s "Best Role-Playing Game", <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s "Best PC RPG", RPGFan's "Overall Game of E3 2005", and, most prestigiously, the "Best Role Playing Game" in the 2005 E3 Game Critics Awards. A near-final build of "Oblivion" was shown at Microsoft's <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> press tent in January 2006, showcasing the game's exteriors. In the months prior to release, anticipation for the game ran high, with critics describing "Oblivion" as "the first next-gen game" only heightening attention. "People were expecting the game to cure blindness and heal the sick", said Pete Hines, Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing for Bethesda.

2K Games had aimed for a late 2005 publication so that the game could be an <a href="Xbox%20360%20launch%20title">Xbox 360 launch title</a>. The official release date for the PC and Xbox 360 versions was originally November 22, 2005, but developmental delays pushed it back to March 20, 2006. A mobile phone version of the game, developed by Superscape and published by Vir2L Studios, was released on May 2, 2006. The PlayStation 3 version of the game (ported by <a href="4J%20Studios">4J Studios</a>) was released on March 20, 2007, in North America and on April 27, 2007, in Europe. This version includes graphical improvements that had been made since the PC and Xbox 360 release, and was subsequently praised for its enhanced visual appeal. A <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> version of the game was also in development before being canceled.

At the 2007 E3, the "Game of the Year" edition for "Oblivion" was announced. In North America and Europe, the game was released in September 2007, for the Xbox 360 and PC, and in October 2007, for the PS3; in Australia, it was released on September 2007, for the Xbox 360 and PC, and in December 2007, for the PS3. It was also released on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> on June 16, 2009. A 5th-anniversary edition of "Oblivion" was announced and released in North America in July 2011 and in Europe two months later. An Xbox 360 version of "<a href="Fallout%203">Fallout 3</a>" and "Oblivion" double pack was announced for release in North America on April 3, however it was not mentioned whether the bundled games include any of the downloadable content released for either game.

On May 3, 2006, the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) in North America changed "Oblivion"s <a href="video%20game%20content%20rating%20system">rating</a> from T (Teen 13+) to M (Mature 17+), citing game content not considered in the ESRB review, i.e., "the presence in the PC version of the game of a locked-out art file that, if accessed by using an apparently unauthorized third party tool, allows the user to play the game with topless versions of female characters". In response to the new content, the ESRB conducted a review of "Oblivion", showing to its reviewers the content originally submitted by Bethesda along with the newly disclosed content.

The ESRB reported that Bethesda Softworks would promptly notify all retailers of the change, issue stickers for retailers and distributors to affix on the product, display the new rating in all following product shipments and marketing, and create a downloadable patch rendering the topless skin inaccessible. Bethesda complied with the request but disagreed with the ESRB's rationale. Some retailers began to check for <a href="Identity%20document">ID</a> before selling "Oblivion" as a result, and one <a href="California%20State%20Assembly">California Assemblyman</a> used the event to criticize the ESRB's inefficiency.

Starting in April 2006, Bethesda released small packages of additional <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) for the game from their website and over the <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>. The first update came as a set of specialized armor for "Oblivion"s ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of <a href="micropayment">micropayment</a>s for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. "Oblivion"s final content pack was released October 15, 2007.

"" is an official expansion for "Oblivion" released on November 21, 2006. Downloadable on the Xbox Live marketplace for the Xbox 360 and available for retail purchase for PC users, the expansion content was included in the original version of the PlayStation 3 release. The expansion was developed, published, and released by Bethesda Softworks. The plot of "Knights of the Nine" centers on the rise of the sorcerer-king Umaril and the player's quest to defeat him with the aid of the lost crusader's relics. Although it made little change to the basic mechanics of "Oblivion", it was judged by reviewers to be a brief but polished addition to the game's main plot.

"", was released on March 27, 2007, for Windows and Xbox 360. The expansion offers more than 30 hours of new adventuring, and features new quests, voice acting, monsters, spells, armor, and expanded freeform gameplay. It features a new land "that [players] can watch change according to [their] vital life-or-death decisions". "Shivering Isles" takes place in the realm of madness ruled over by the Daedric prince Sheogorath. The player is tasked by Sheogorath with saving the realm from an approaching cataclysm known as the Greymarch.

"Oblivion" received universal acclaim from critics, and became a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7 million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3 million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> editor Kristan Reed stated that the game "successfully unites some of the best elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> wrote that compared to "Morrowind", which was one of the best role-playing games he has seen in years, ""Oblivion" is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally have no interest in a role-playing game should find it hard to resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>"s Jason D'Aprile stated, "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the "Elder Scrolls IV" takes that concept and runs with it".

"<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>" editors noted that the game is "heavily steeped in RPG tradition, however, its appeal stretches far beyond the hardcore RPG demographic thanks to its ease of play, boundless ambition and focused attention to detail". Scott Tobias of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" wrote that the game is "worth playing for the sense of discovery—each environment looks different from the last and requires a nuanced reaction—makes the action addictive". GameZone staff commented on how one can spend a lot of the gameplay time by leveling up his or her character, doing various quests, and customizing the character before even starting the main quest.

<a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>'s Duke Ferris noted that "the voices occasionally repeat" but was impressed that the developers managed to fit a lot of voiced dialog into the game, where most is "high-quality work". IGN editor Charles Onyett praised the game's storytelling and "easy to navigate menus".

Despite the praise, Patrick Joynt of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> criticized the conversations between in-game NPCs and the player: "When an NPC greets you with a custom piece of dialogue (such as a guard's warning) and then reverts to the standard options (like a guard's cheerful directions just after that warning) it's more jarring than the canned dialogue by itself". GameSpy's Justin Speer criticized the "disruptive loading stutters while moving across the game world" and long loading times. Speer noted several miscellaneous bugs, such as unintended floating objects and unsynchronized lip-synching and speech. Onyett of IGN criticized the disjunction between enemies that scaled up according to the player's level and not their combat abilities or NPC allies, the loading times and the imprecision in the combat system, but stated that "none of those minor criticisms hold back "Oblivion" from being a thoroughly enjoyable, user-friendly, gorgeous experience with enough content to keep you returning time and time again".

"Oblivion" won a number of industry and publication awards. In 2006, the game was awarded the title "Game of the Year" at the G-Phoria Video Game Awards and at the Spike TV Video Game Awards. At the 24th annual Golden Joystick Awards, "Oblivion" was awarded "PLAY.com Ultimate Game of the Year", "Xbox Game of the Year", and "ebuyer.com PC Game of the Year". The game was titled the best role-playing game of 2006 by 1UP.com, G4, IGN, GameSpy, GameSpot, Game Revolution, "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>", and the <a href="Interactive%20Achievement%20Awards">Interactive Achievement Awards</a>. The editors of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" presented "Oblivion" with their 2006 "Best Technology" and "Best Role-Playing Game" awards, and named it the second-best computer game of the year. They summarized it as "an unforgettable masterpiece". In 2007, "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" magazine rated "Oblivion" number one on their list of the top 100 games of all time. In addition to the awards won by the game itself, Patrick Stewart's voice work as Uriel Septim won a Spike TV award, and the musical score by composer Jeremy Soule won the inaugural <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award">MTV Video Music Award</a> for "Best Original Score" through an international popular vote.

E. W. Hornung

Ernest William Hornung (7 June 1866 – 22 March 1921) was an English author and poet known for writing the <a href="A.%20J.%20Raffles">A. J. Raffles</a> series of stories about a <a href="gentleman%20thief">gentleman thief</a> in late 19th-century London. Hornung was educated at <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a>; as a result of poor health he left the school in December 1883 to travel to Sydney, where he stayed for two years. He drew on his Australian experiences as a background when he began writing, initially short stories and later novels.

In 1898 he wrote "In the Chains of Crime", which introduced Raffles and his sidekick, <a href="Bunny%20Manders">Bunny Manders</a>; the characters were based partly on his friends <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and his lover, <a href="Lord%20Alfred%20Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>, and also on the characters of <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Dr. Watson</a>, created by his brother-in-law, <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. The series of Raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in 1899, and two further books of Raffles short stories followed, as well as a poorly received novel. Aside from his Raffles stories, Hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction, publishing numerous books from 1890, with "<a href="A%20Bride%20from%20the%20Bush">A Bride from the Bush</a>" to his 1914 novel "The Crime Doctor".

The First World War brought an end to Hornung's fictional output. His son, Oscar, was killed at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a> in July 1915. Hornung joined the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, initially in England, then in France, where he helped run a canteen and library. He published two collections of poetry during the war, and then, afterwards, one further volume of verse and an account of his time spent in France, "Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front". Hornung's fragile constitution was further weakened by the stress of his war work. To aid his recuperation, he and his wife visited the south of France in 1921. He fell ill from influenza on the journey, and died on 22 March 1921, aged 54.

Although much of Hornung's work has fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories continued to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with a wider range of themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.

Hornung was born Ernest William Hornung on 7 June 1866 at Cleveland Villas, <a href="Marton%2C%20Middlesbrough">Marton</a>, <a href="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>; he was nicknamed Willie from an early age. He was the third son, and youngest of eight children, of John Peter Hornung (1821–86) and his wife Harriet Armstrong (1824–96). John was christened Johan Petrus Hornung in the <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> region of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a> and, after working in Hamburg for a shipping firm, had moved to Britain in the 1840s as a coal and iron merchant. John married Harriet in March 1848, by which time he had anglicised his name. At the age of 13 Hornung joined <a href="St%20Ninian%27s%20School%2C%20Moffat">St Ninian's Preparatory School</a> in <a href="Moffat">Moffat</a>, <a href="Dumfriesshire">Dumfriesshire</a>, before enrolling at <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a> in 1880. Hornung was well liked at school, and developed a lifelong love of cricket despite limited skills at the game, which were further worsened by bad eyesight, <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and, according to his biographer Peter Rowland, a permanent state of generally poor health.

When Hornung was 17 his health worsened; he left Uppingham and travelled to Australia, where it was hoped by his family that the climate would be beneficial. On his arrival he was employed as a tutor to the Parsons family in <a href="Mossgiel%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mossgiel</a> in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a>, south-western <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. In addition to teaching, he spent time working in remote sheep stations in the outback and contributing material to the weekly magazine "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>"; he also began writing what was to become his first novel. Although he spent only two years in Australia, the experience was "the making of him and ... the making of his career as a writer", according to Rowland. Another biographer, <a href="Mark%20Valentine">Mark Valentine</a>, wrote that Hornung "seems to have regarded this period as one of the most satisfying of his life".

Hornung returned to England in February 1886, before the death of his father in November. From a position of relative prosperity, John's coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he was in financially straitened circumstances by the time of his death. Hornung found work in London as a journalist and story writer, often publishing his work under a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>, although in 1887 he published his first story under his own name, "Stroke of Five", which appeared in "<a href="Belgravia%20%28magazine%29">Belgravia</a>" magazine. His work as a journalist was during the period of <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> and the series of <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">five murders</a>, which were undertaken against a background of rising urban crime in London; it was around this time that Hornung developed an interest in criminal behaviour.

Hornung had worked on the novel manuscript he brought back from Australia and, between July and November 1890, the story, "<a href="A%20Bride%20from%20the%20Bush">A Bride from the Bush</a>", was published in five parts in "<a href="The%20Cornhill%20Magazine">The Cornhill Magazine</a>". It was also released that year as a book—his first. The story—described by Rowland as an "assured, graceful comedy of manners"—used Hornung's knowledge of Australia as a backdrop, and the device of an Australian bride to examine British social behaviour; the novel was well received by critics. In 1891 Hornung became a member of two cricket clubs: the Idlers, whose members included Arthur Conan Doyle, <a href="Robert%20Barr%20%28writer%29">Robert Barr</a> and <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a>, and the Strand club.

Hornung knew Doyle's sister, Constance ("Connie") Aimée Monica Doyle (1868–1924), whom he had met when he visited Portugal. Connie was described by Doyle's biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, as being attractive, "with pre-Raphaelite looks ... the most sought-after of the Doyle daughters". By December 1892, when Hornung, Doyle and Jerome visited the <a href="Black%20Museum">Black Museum</a> at <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>, Hornung and Connie were engaged, and in 1893 Hornung dedicated his second novel, "Tiny Luttrell", "to C.A.M.D." They were married on 27 September 1893, although Doyle was not at the wedding and relations between the two writers were sometimes strained. The Hornungs had a son, Arthur Oscar, in 1895; while his first name was from Doyle, who was also Arthur's <a href="Godparent">godfather</a>, the boy's middle name was probably after Doyle and Hornung's mutual friend <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and it was by his second name that he was known. In 1894 Doyle and Hornung began work on a play for <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a>, on the subject of boxing during <a href="Regency%20era">the Regency</a>; Doyle was initially eager and paid Hornung £50 as a down payment before he withdrew after the first act had been written: the work was never completed.

Like Hornung's first novel, "Tiny Luttrell" had Australia as a backdrop and also used the plot device of an Australian woman in a culturally alien environment. The Australian theme was present in his next four novels: "The Boss of Taroomba" (1894), "The Unbidden Guest" (1894), "Irralie's Bushranger" (1896) and "The Rogue's March" (1896). In the last of these Hornung wrote of the Australian convict transport system, and showed evidence of a "growing fascination with the motivation behind criminal behaviour and a deliberate sympathy for the criminal hero as a victim of events", while "Irralie's Bushranger" introduced the character Stingaree, an Oxford-educated, Australian <a href="gentleman%20thief">gentleman thief</a>, in a novel that "casts doubt on conventional responses" to a positive criminal character, according to Hornung's biographer, Stephen Knight.

In 1898 Hornung's mother died, aged 72 and he dedicated his next book, a series of short stories titled "Some Persons Unknown", to her memory. Later that year Hornung and his wife visited Italy for six months, staying in <a href="Posillipo">Posillipo</a>; his account of the location appeared in an article of the May 1899 edition of "The Cornhill Magazine". The Hornungs returned to London in early 1899, to a house in Pitt Street, <a href="West%20Kensington">West Kensington</a>, where they lived for the next six years.

The fictional character Stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in "<a href="Cassell%27s%20Magazine">Cassell's Magazine</a>", <a href="A.%20J.%20Raffles">A. J. Raffles</a>. The character was modelled on <a href="George%20Cecil%20Ives">George Cecil Ives</a>, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the <a href="Albany%20%28London%29">Albany</a>, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series "In the Chains of Crime" was published in June that year, titled "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name "<a href="The%20Amateur%20Cracksman">The Amateur Cracksman</a>", which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school <a href="Fagging">fag</a>) <a href="Bunny%20Manders">Bunny Manders</a> being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Dr. Watson</a>—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" (Wilde's lover, <a href="Lord%20Alfred%20Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" wrote that "stern moralists" would consider the book's premise "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left "The Spectator" reviewer "expressing [their] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue."
After publishing two novels, "Dead Men Tell No Tales" in 1899 and "Peccavi" in 1900, Hornung published a second collection of Raffles stories, "<a href="The%20Black%20Mask">The Black Mask</a>", in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told to apply for the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; "The Spectator" declared "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" thought that Hornung's "invention has obviously flagged ... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote "Peccavi" should stoop to this".

In 1903 Hornung collaborated with Eugène Presbrey to write a four-act play, "Raffles, The Amateur Cracksman", which was based on two previously published short stories, "Gentlemen and Players" and "The Return Match". The play was first performed at the <a href="Princess%20Theatre%20%2829th%20Street%29">Princess Theatre</a>, New York, on 27 October 1903 with <a href="Kyrle%20Bellew">Kyrle Bellew</a> as Raffles, and ran for 168 performances.

In 1905, after publishing four other books in the interim, Hornung brought back the character Stingaree, previously seen in "Irralie's Bushranger". Later that year he responded to public demand and produced a third series of short Raffles stories in "<a href="A%20Thief%20in%20the%20Night%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">A Thief in the Night</a>", in which Manders relates some of his and Raffles's earlier adventures. The reviewer for the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" thought that "the sentimental side of the story has never before been shown so dramatically and romantically", and described the book as "thrilling and exciting". Hornung's next book was published in 1909 and was the final Raffles story, the full-length novel "<a href="Mr.%20Justice%20Raffles">Mr. Justice Raffles</a>"; the book was poorly received, with the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" asking if "Hornung is perhaps a little tired of Raffles", and stating that "it has not the magic or the 'go' of the first "Raffles", and there is no good in pretending that it has". During the course of the year he collaborated with Charles Sansom to write a play "A Visit From Raffles", which was performed in November that year at the Brixton Empress Theatre, London.

Hornung turned away from Raffles thereafter, and in February 1911 published "The Camera Fiend", a thriller whose narrator is an asthmatic cricket enthusiast with an ironmaster father, much as Hornung was himself. The story concerned the attempts of a scientist to photograph the soul as it left the body. Hornung followed this up with "Fathers of Men" (1912) and "The Thousandth Woman" (1913) before "Witching Hill" (1913), a collection of eight short stories in which he introduced the characters Uvo Delavoye and the narrator Gillon, whom Rowland considers to be "reincarnations of Raffles and Bunny". Hornung's next work, "The Crime Doctor" (1914) marked the end of his fictional output.

Oscar Hornung left <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> in 1914, intending to enter <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, later that year. When Britain entered the war against Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the <a href="Essex%20Regiment">Essex Regiment</a>. He was killed at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a> on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title "Trusty and Well Beloved", released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something he had been doing more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, "Ballad of Ensign Joy", was published later that year.

In July 1917 Hornung's poem, "Wooden Crosses", was published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", and in September, "Bond and Free" appeared. Towards the end of the year, he was accepted as a volunteer in a YMCA canteen and library "a short distance behind the Front Line". During his service in <a href="Arras">Arras</a>, in February 1918 he borrowed a staff car from a friend and visited his son's grave near Ypres, before returning to the library in Arras. Hornung was concerned about support for <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> among troops, and wrote to his wife about it. When she spoke to Doyle about the matter, rather than discussing it with Hornung he informed the military authorities. Hornung was angered by Doyle's action, and "told him there was no need for him to 'butt in' except for his own 'satisfaction'." Relations between the two men were strained as a result. Hornung continued to work at the library until the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> in March overran the British positions and he was forced to retreat, firstly to <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> and then, in April, back to England. He stayed in England until November 1918, when he again took up his YMCA duties, establishing a rest hut and library in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. In 1919 Hornung's account of his time spent in France, "Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front", was published. Doyle later wrote of the book that "there are parts of it which are brilliant in their vivid portrayal", while Hornung's biographer, Alison Cox, described the book as "one of the best records of the war as experienced on the front lines". That year Hornung also published his third and final volume of poetry, "The Young Guard".

Hornung finished his work with the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday in the south of France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a>, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of <a href="George%20Gissing">George Gissing</a>. Doyle, returning from a <a href="Spiritualism">spiritualist</a> lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.

When Hornung had still been courting Doyle's sister, Doyle wrote that "I like young Willie Hornung very much ... he is one of the sweetest-natured and most delicate-minded men I ever knew". Honouring him after his death, Doyle wrote that he "was a <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Dr. [Samuel] Johnson</a> without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain". His obituarist in "The Times" described him as "a man of large and generous nature, a delightful companion and conversationalist".
Much of Hornung's work fell out of favour as time passed; Rowland observed that "all of Hornung's other works have been forgotten, with the possible exception of "Stingaree", but the cricketing Cracksman continues to enthral". The idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of Hornung's legacies, and "Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism" states that "critics have also interpreted Raffles as a prototype of the antihero in modern crime fiction". The academic Frank Wadleigh Chandler, describing Raffles's death, writes that "all his creator's attempts to portray him as a hero, rather than an anti-hero, deservedly fail." Valentine highlights one aspect of the stories was the mix of "devilry and daring" demonstrated by Raffles; in this respect he was a literary "forerunner of <a href="Simon%20Templar">The Saint</a>, <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> and other insouciant types". The writer <a href="Colin%20Watson%20%28writer%29">Colin Watson</a> agrees, and called Hornung "a precursor of <a href="Ian%20Fleming">[Ian] Fleming</a>".

The character continued in book form: the writer Philip Atkey, under the pseudonym <a href="Barry%20Perowne">Barry Perowne</a>, obtained permission from the Hornung estate to continue the Raffles stories, and seven more novels followed between 1933 and 1940, with Raffles transformed from a gentleman thief to a tough adventurer. Perowne continued the series in 1950, and 14 of his stories were published in the 1974 volume "Raffles Revisited". Hornung's original stories have undergone a number of reprints, and when all the short stories were published in a single volume, <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> considered it "a splendid idea". In 1975 Greene had written a play based on the Raffles stories, "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20A.%20J.%20Raffles">The Return of A. J. Raffles</a>", which premiered at the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>, with <a href="Denholm%20Elliott">Denholm Elliott</a> as Raffles.

There were several Raffles films made during Hornung's lifetime, Further films followed in the years after his death, including "<a href="Raffles%2C%20the%20Amateur%20Cracksman%20%281925%20film%29">Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman</a>" (1925), with <a href="House%20Peters%20Sr.">House Peters Sr.</a>; "<a href="Raffles%20%281930%20film%29">Raffles</a>" (1930), featuring <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald Colman</a>; "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20Raffles">The Return of Raffles</a>" (1933), with <a href="George%20Barraud">George Barraud</a>; and "<a href="Raffles%20%281939%20film%29">Raffles</a>" (1939), starring <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a>; the last of these was a <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Productions">Samuel Goldwyn Productions</a> remake of their own 1930 film, which the academic <a href="Victor%20E.%20Neuburg">Victor E. Neuburg</a> called the "most memorable portrayal" of the character.

The BBC has dramatised some of Hornung's Raffles stories for radio, first in the 1940s and again in the 1990s, when <a href="Nigel%20Havers">Nigel Havers</a> played Raffles. In 1977 <a href="Anthony%20Valentine">Anthony Valentine</a> played the thief, and <a href="Christopher%20Strauli">Christopher Strauli</a> his partner, in a <a href="Raffles%20%28TV%20series%29">Yorkshire Television series</a>. A 2001 TV version, "<a href="The%20Gentleman%20Thief">The Gentleman Thief</a>", adapted the stories for a contemporary audience, with Havers playing the lead.

Hornung's prose is widely admired for its lucid, simple style. Oliver Edwards, writing in "The Times", considered that "not the least attractive part of the Raffles books is the simple, plain, unaffected language in which each one of them is written". The obituarist in the same newspaper agrees, and thinks Hornung had "a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise". Colin Watson also considers the point, and observes that in Hornung's writing, "superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to the point", while Doyle admired his "sudden use of the right adjective and the right phrase", something the writer and journalist Jeremy Lewis sees as a "flamboyant, Kiplingesque taste for the vivid".

Critics have observed that Hornung's stories and novels are well-structured. <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> wrote that Hornung was "a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer. Anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must admire his work". Watson states that Hornung's "writing has pace. The stories, however ridiculous, carry the readers along briskly". According to Cox, "Hornung's work showed steady maturation" during his career, a point that Doyle also agreed with, although Edwards disagrees, and thinks "The Crime Doctor" to be one of Hornung's weaker books.

Hornung's approach to characters differed from other contemporary authors. Cox notes that Hornung "frequently chose to write from the perspective of the criminal", and while many of Hornung's novels contained criminal activity as a major element of the plot, the critic for "<a href="Contemporary%20Authors">Contemporary Authors</a>" states that the works do not "belong to the crime-fiction genre". Hornung's works included elements from more general fiction, "such as false identities, disguises, and disowned heiresses".

The academic Nick Rance identifies three categories of Raffles stories: "the rise of the New Woman", in which Raffles either escapes from romantic entanglements, or uses the infatuations of a woman in order to achieve his aims; "the rise of the plutocracy", in which Raffles steals from the <a href="nouveau%20riche">nouveau riche</a> as much as the upper classes; and those stories that seek "to reaffirm or re-establish a sense of middle-class identity". The last category is based on Raffles not being a member of "<a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">Society</a>", only being accepted because of his cricketing ability and associated fame. From this point, Raffles's stealing from the rich is a "rearguard action on behalf of the puritan values" which was perceived as making up middle-class values, although Rance also states that those values are obscured because of the changing boundaries between the classes. Gariepy makes the same point, and considers that "Raffles's daring exploits and fantastic adventures symbolized the growing rebellion against Victorian sensibility at the turn of the century".
Hornung kept abreast of scientific and medical developments, and was keen to incorporate them into his stories which, the critic for "Contemporary Authors" states, shows Hornung had "a streak of modernity and decided interest in new ideas". "The Camera Fiend" uses the modern technology of the camera as an instrument central to the plot, while the protagonist of "The Crime Doctor" uses psychology to identify criminals.

Throughout the Raffles stories patriotism runs as an intermittent theme—to such an extent that the writer William Vivian Butler describes him as a "super-patriot". In the course of the short story "A Jubilee Present" Raffles, celebrating <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">diamond jubilee</a>, steals a gold cup from the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and sends it to the queen, telling Manders that "we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely the finest monarch in the world". In "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles volunteers for service in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, changing his name and hair colour—he jokes to Manders that he is prepared to "dye for his country"—and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy.

Some of Hornung's novels, including "The Shadow of the Rope", "No Hero" and "The Thousandth Woman", are notable for "portraying women in a rather modern, favorable light", according to the critic for "Contemporary Authors", showing concern for their unequal position in society. Cox identifies a theme of guilt running through a number of works. Among these is "Peccavi", in which a clergyman lives his life trying to atone for an earlier crime; "Shadow of the Rope", in which a woman is accused of her husband's murder; and "The Thousandth Woman", in which a woman stands by her lover after he is accused of murder.

Although Hornung's Australian experience was brief, it influenced most of his literary work from "A Bride from the Bush" published in 1899, to "Old Offenders and a Few Old Scores", which was published after his death. According to Chandler, "nearly two-thirds of [Hornung's] books refer in varying degrees to Australian incidents and experiences", with "even Raffles" starting his criminal career in Australia. Some of Horning's works—such as "A Bride from the Bush"—were praised for their accuracy of detail in depicting the Australian environment, although the detail could overwhelm the storyline, as in "The Rogue's March".

Cricket was one of Hornung's lifelong passions, and he was delighted to become a member of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> in 1907. The sport also permeated his stories, with Raffles playing for the Gentlemen of England. Rance observes that Raffles compares law-breaking and cricket: "crime is reckoned as another and better sport".

Raffles does on occasion disparage his game, commenting to Manders in "Gentlemen and Players", "where's the satisfaction of taking a man's wicket when you want his spoons?" Valentine also considers the point, and sees Raffles's cricket as a front for his criminal activities, citing Raffles's praise for cricket for "the glorious protection it affords a person of my proclivities".

Watson examines Raffles's actions within the broader context of <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a>, with Raffles acting within his own moral code "of what is 'done' and 'not done'." Orwell, in his essay "<a href="Raffles%20and%20Miss%20Blandish">Raffles and Miss Blandish</a>", observes that when Raffles feels remorse, it "is almost purely social; he has disgraced 'the old school', he has lost his right to enter 'decent society', he has forfeited his amateur status and become a cad".

Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory

Yarralumla is a large inner south <a href="suburb">suburb</a> of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, the capital city of Australia. Located approximately south-west of the <a href="City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">city</a>, Yarralumla extends along the south-west bank of <a href="Lake%20Burley%20Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>. (The lake was created after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> through the blocking, with a dam, of the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a>.)

In 1828, <a href="Henry%20Donnison">Henry Donnison</a>, a Sydney merchant, was granted a lease on the western side of Stirling Ridge. Donnison's land was named "Yarralumla" in a survey of the area conducted in 1834, apparently after the indigenous people's term for the area. It was also spelt "Yarrolumla" in other documents. In 1881, the estate was bought by Frederick Campbell, grandson of <a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20landowner%29">Robert Campbell</a> who built nearby "<a href="Duntroon%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duntroon</a>". He completed the construction of a large, gabled, brick house on his property in 1891 that now serves as the site of <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Government House</a>, the official residence of the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a>. Campbell's house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead, the main portions of which were erected from local stone in the 1830s. Among the old Yarralumla homestead's most notable occupants were <a href="Terence%20Aubrey%20Murray">Sir Terence Aubrey Murray</a>, who owned Yarralumla sheep station from 1837 to 1859, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who owned the property from 1859 to 1881, and Augustus' father <a href="Colonel%20%28British%20Army%29">Colonel</a> <a href="John%20George%20Nathaniel%20Gibbes">John George Nathaniel Gibbes</a> (1787–1873). (Augustus "Gussie" Gibbes was Murray's brother-in-law; he also advanced money to Frederick Campbell to assist with the construction, in 1890–1891, of Campbell's grand new family house at Yarralumla.)

The modern suburb of Yarralumla was <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d by the government in 1928 and was home to approximately 3,000 people and many <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s. In recent years, it has become one of Canberra's most desirable and expensive residential suburbs because of its wide leafy streets, attractive lakeside setting and central location.

Yarralumla is located in the central Canberra district of <a href="South%20Canberra">South Canberra</a>. It is bordered by Lake Burley Griffin to the north, <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth Avenue</a> and <a href="Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Capital Hill</a> to the east, Adelaide Avenue and the Cotter Road to the south, and <a href="Scrivener%20Dam">Scrivener Dam</a>, Lady Denman Drive and part of the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a> to the west.

Although Yarralumla is one of the largest suburbs in Canberra by area, its population remains quite small because more than half of its area consists of open space or non-residential development, including Weston and Stirling Parks, the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Golf%20Club">Royal Canberra Golf Club</a>, and the grounds of Government House. A relatively high proportion of houses are occupied by diplomatic missions.
The embassy area of Yarralumla is located towards the eastern end of the suburb next to Stirling Park. It is the hilliest area of Yarralumla; <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> and the <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle%2C%20Canberra">Parliamentary Triangle</a> are located nearby.

The streets in Yarralumla are named after Australian <a href="Governors%20of%20the%20Australian%20states">governors</a> and botanists. Most of the older streets in the suburb are laid out on an approximately <a href="grid%20plan">rectangular grid</a> with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a <a href="dormitory">dormitory</a> suburb, there are no major through roads. Access to the rest of the city can be made from Adelaide Avenue, <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth Avenue</a>, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street.

Yarralumla is located on the Yarralumla Formation which is a <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>/<a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> formation that was formed around 425 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a> during the <a href="Silurian%20Period">Silurian Period</a>. The formation extends from <a href="Red%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Red Hill</a> and <a href="Woden%20Town%20Centre">Woden</a> in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s, <a href="coral">coral</a> and primitive <a href="crinoid">crinoid</a>s. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the <a href="Deakin%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Deakin</a> anticline are places where the formation is exposed and easily studied.

The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original <a href="land%20grant">land grant</a>s, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 <a href="Henry%20Donnison">Henry Donnison</a>, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig "Ellen" on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to <a href="William%20Klensendorlffe">William Klensendorlffe</a> (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named "Yarralumla" in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. "Yarralumla" was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning "echo". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the <a href="Yarrolumla%20Parish">Yarrolumla parish</a>.

The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian <a href="Terence%20Aubrey%20Murray">Sir Terence Aubrey Murray</a> (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, <a href="John%20George%20Nathaniel%20Gibbes">Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873)</a>, MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, <a href="Augustus%20Onslow%20Manby%20Gibbes">Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes</a> (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.

Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of <a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20landowner%29">Robert Campbell</a>, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as "Yarralumla" or "Government House". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.

In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia. Soon afterwards in 1913, the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth Government</a> purchased the property. Tenant farmers were allowed to stay on the land on annual leases, some remaining until 1963 when the Molonglo River was dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin.

With the construction of Australia's capital city underway, the <a href="Yarralumla%20brickworks">Yarralumla brickworks</a> were established in 1913 to supply building material. The bricks were used for many of Canberra's buildings, including the <a href="Old%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">provisional Parliament House</a>. In 1917, Walter Burley Griffin named the area surrounding the brickworks "Westridge".
A <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> goods <a href="railway">railway</a> was constructed for the transportation of bricks to some of the major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places such as Parliament House, and the <a href="Kingston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Kingston</a> Power House.
Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and <a href="Westbourne%20Woods">Westbourne Woods</a> <a href="arboretum">arboretum</a> was started in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. <a href="Thomas%20Charles%20Weston">Thomas Charles Weston</a> was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation of more than two million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Golf%20Club">Royal Canberra Golf Club</a>, with the remainder forming part of <a href="Weston%20Park%2C%20Canberra">Weston Park</a>. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.

In 1922, a workers' tent camp was erected on the eastern side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The following year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved in the construction of the provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27). The men from Howie's worked on the <a href="Hotel%20Canberra">Hotel Canberra</a> and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.
The Stirling Park camps were known as Westlake to their new inhabitants, and previously "Gura Bung Dhaura" (stony ground) to the local <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> people. In 1925, the population of this temporary suburb was 700. This represented roughly one-fifth of the total population of the Federal Capital Territory at the time; in the region, only Molonglo Settlement had a larger population, at 750. The site was chosen so that it was near to Parliament House but hidden from direct line of sight from anywhere "important". The small cottages at Westlake were removed starting in the mid-1950s, with the last one removed in 1965. Many of the Westlake workers' cottages were moved to <a href="Queanbeyan">Queanbeyan</a> and are still used as housing today. The Stirling Park near the embassy area of Yarralumla now covers the historic Westlake settlement area.

The Commonwealth Forestry School was established in Westridge near the brickworks and Westbourne Woods in 1926. It opened with its first intake of students in the following year. Today the heritage-listed Forestry School and the associated principal's residence Westridge House are located on Banks Street, Yarralumla. The <a href="Commonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) Forestry and Forestry Products subsumed the school in 1975. Westridge House, an impressive <a href="Tudor%20Revival%20architecture">Tudor-style</a> structure, underwent a <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>500,000 refurbishment and is used as a residence for the chief officer of the CSIRO.

By 1928, there were over 130 people on the electoral roll for Westridge. The majority of the population consisted of men working at the brickworks and nursery. Westridge was <a href="gazettal">gazetted</a> as a Canberra suburb in 1928.

Westridge was renamed Yarralumla in the 1950s. In 1963, Lake Burley Griffin was filled and Yarralumla was expanded to include Westlake, which had up until then been part of <a href="Acton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Acton</a>.

After the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the suburb began to expand rapidly with the construction of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built <a href="monocrete%20construction">monocrete</a>, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.

The population of the Westridge area on the 1928 electoral roll numbered over 130. At the , Yarralumla had a population of 2,890 people. Of these 46.9% were male. The suburb had only 1.0% indigenous Australians, substantially below the national average of 2.8%. The percentage of married people in the suburb was nine points higher than the national average, and the proportion of residents who had never married was 9 points lower. Despite the higher level of marriage, this did not translate into a higher level of children; 49.6% of families consisted of a couple without children in the household, compared to the national average of 37.8%. Yarralumla residents had a median age of 49, compared to a Canberra average of 35. The suburb had an older population for a city of young people; the median national age is 38 and 41.7% of Yarralumla residents were 55 or over, compared to the national figure of 27.6%.

Yarralumla is a comparatively wealthy suburb with a 2016 median weekly personal income of $1,347; this compares to an ACT-wide figure of $998 and an Australia-wide figure of $662. The public service or defence force employed around 21.7% of the workforce, somewhat less than the ACT average of 23.6%. This compared to 1.9% for Australia as a whole. The higher incomes were derived from the suburb's white-collar base; 63.5% of Yarralumla's workforce was employed as professionals or in managerial posts, compared to 35.2% nationally. In contrast, only 3.4% were engaged in blue-collar occupations, compared with 15.8% for the nation as a whole. The proportion of the population working as tradesmen and technicians was almost four times lower than average across Australia.

The median monthly housing loan repayments in Yarralumla in 2016 were $2,700, compared to the ACT-wide figure of $2,058 and a federal average of $1,755. At $450, the weekly rent was more than 50% higher than the national average. Yarralumla's median house price was $1m in 2011 versus $530,000 for the whole of the ACT in 2013. The rate of home ownership in the suburb was 46.9%—much higher than the national average of 31.0%. 25.4% of the households rented. Accommodation was mostly separate houses (64.2%), although the number of residences in the suburb has been increasing through conversion of blocks to dual occupancy and other medium-density-type developments. Despite this, only 5.9% of residences were apartments or units, slightly less than half of the national average.

The population of Yarralumla in 2016 was predominantly Australian-born, with some 69.3% of its residents being born in Australia. The second most prevalent birthplace was England at 6.0%, followed by New Zealand and United States with 1.6 and 1.5% respectively. The suburb was more oriented towards the Anglo-Celtic majority than the rest of Australia; English was spoken at home by 80.3% of the population, compared to the national average of 72.7%. Every other language was spoken by less than 2% of the population. Italian, Mandarin, Greek, German and French were all spoken by at least 0.8% of the population. The most popular religious affiliations in descending order were no religion, <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Australia">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican</a>, <a href="Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia">Uniting</a> and <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian and Reformed</a>. The proportion of the population professing to having no religion was 34.6%, higher than the national average of 29.6%.

The Yarralumla local shopping centre is located on the corner of Bentham and Novar Streets. The centre contains a <a href="supermarket">supermarket</a>, <a href="bakery">bakery</a>, dry-cleaners, video store/post office, <a href="pharmacist">chemist</a>, gift shop and <a href="newsagent">newsagent</a> as well as several restaurants and speciality shops.

<a href="Weston%20Park%2C%20Canberra">Weston Park</a> is situated on a peninsula near the western end of Lake Burley Griffin. The park includes swimming areas, children's play equipment and wading pools, and a miniature railway, and is a popular <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a> spot on weekends. Weston Park forms part of a string of parks that line the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin; other parks include Yarralumla Bay, <a href="Lennox%20Gardens">Lennox Gardens</a> (incorporating a Japanese garden named Canberra Nara Park) and Stirling Park.

Like most of Canberra, Yarralumla's only scheduled public transport is provided by <a href="ACTION">ACTION</a> buses. On weekdays, route 2 provides a service from Yarralumla to <a href="Woden%20Town%20Centre">Woden</a> and <a href="City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">City</a> Interchanges along Novar Street, Schlich Street and Hopetoun Circuit. Route 2 operates every 30 minutes until 6pm and hourly from 6pm to 11 pm. On weekends and public holidays, route 932 provides an hourly service along the same streets as route 2.

Yarralumla's first school, the Catholic St Peter Chanel's Primary School, opened in 1956; it closed in the 1990s. <a href="Yarralumla%20Primary%20School">Yarralumla Primary School</a>, a public school, opened a year after St Peter Chanel's in 1957. Half of the original primary school is now used as a behavioural centre catering to problem students. <a href="Preschool%20education">Preschools</a> in Yarralumla include the <a href="Montessori%20method">Montessori preschool</a> on Loftus Street. There is also a day care facility called Little Lodge on Macgillivray Street.

Battle of Öland

The Battle of Öland was a naval battle between an allied <a href="Denmark%E2%80%93Norway">Danish</a>-<a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> fleet and the Swedish navy in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, off the east coast of <a href="%C3%96land">Öland</a> on 1 June 1676. The battle was a part of the <a href="Scanian%20War">Scanian War</a> (1675–79) fought for supremacy over the southern Baltic. Sweden was in urgent need of reinforcements for its north German possessions; Denmark sought to ferry an army to <a href="Scania">Scania</a> in southern Sweden to open a front on Swedish soil.

Just as the battle began, the Swedish flagship "<a href="Kronan%20%28ship%29">Kronan</a>" sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, <a href="Lorentz%20Creutz">Lorentz Creutz</a>. The allied force under the leadership of the Dutch admiral <a href="Cornelis%20Tromp">Cornelis Tromp</a> took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral <a href="Claes%20Uggla">Claes Uggla</a>, was surrounded and his flagship "<a href="Sv%C3%A4rdet">Svärdet</a>" battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a <a href="fire%20ship">fire ship</a>. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.

The battle resulted in Danish naval supremacy, which was upheld throughout the war. The Danish King <a href="Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark">Christian V</a> was able to ship troops over to the Swedish side of <a href="%C3%98resund">the Sound</a>, and on 29 June a force of 14,500 men landed at Råå, just south of <a href="Helsingborg">Helsingborg</a> in southernmost Sweden. Scania became the main battleground of the war, culminating with the bloody <a href="battle%20of%20Lund">battles of Lund</a>, <a href="battle%20of%20Halmstad">Halmstad</a> and <a href="battle%20of%20Landskrona">Landskrona</a>. Danish and Dutch naval forces were left free to raze Öland and the Swedish east coast all the way up to Stockholm. The Swedish failure at Öland also prompted King <a href="Charles%20XI%20of%20Sweden">Charles XI</a> to order a commission to investigate the fiasco, but in the end no one was found responsible.

In the 1660s, Sweden reached its height as a European <a href="great%20power">great power</a>. It had recently defeated Denmark, one of its main competitors for hegemony in the Baltic, in the <a href="Torstenson%20War">Torstenson War</a> (1643–45) and the <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281657%E2%80%9358%29">Dano-Swedish War</a> (1657–58). At the <a href="Second%20Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%B6msebro%20%281645%29">Treaties of Brömsebro</a> (1645) and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Roskilde">Roskilde</a> (1658), Denmark was forced to cede the islands of <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> and <a href="%C3%96sel">Ösel</a>, all of its eastern territories on the <a href="Scandinavian%20Peninsula">Scandinavian Peninsula</a>, and parts of Norway. In a <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281658%E2%80%931660%29">third war</a>, from 1658 to 1660, King <a href="Charles%20X%20Gustav%20of%20Sweden">Charles X</a> of Sweden attempted to finish off Denmark for good. The move was in part due to bold royal ambition, but also a result of Sweden's being a highly militarized society geared for almost constant warfare, a <a href="fiscal-military%20state">fiscal-military state</a>. Disbanding the Swedish forces meant settling outstanding pay, so there was an underlying incentive to keep hostilities alive and let soldiers live off enemy lands and plunder. In the end, the renewed attack failed with interventions by the leading naval powers of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. Charles' plans to subdue Denmark were thwarted and <a href="Tr%C3%B8ndelag">Trøndelag</a> and <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> were returned to Denmark in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Copenhagen%20%281660%29">Treaty of Copenhagen</a> in 1660 while Sweden was allowed to keep the rest of its recent conquests.

Charles X died in February 1660 and was succeeded by a <a href="regency%20council">regency council</a>—led by the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> <a href="Hedvig%20Eleonora%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp">Hedvig Eleonora</a>—that ruled in the name of <a href="Charles%20XI">Charles XI</a> who was only four at the time of his father's death. Sweden had come close to almost complete control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French <a href="Triple%20Alliance%20%281668%29">1668 Triple Alliance</a> of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.

While the Swedish policy was to avoid war and to consolidate its gains, Danish policy after 1660 was to seek an opportunity to regain its losses. Under the <a href="House%20of%20Oldenburg">Oldenburg</a> King <a href="Frederick%20III%20of%20Denmark">Frederick III</a>, the foreign policy was aimed at isolating Sweden while setting itself up in a favorable position in future wars. Denmark attempted to position itself in the alliances among the 17th century Europe great powers. <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> <a href="early%20modern%20France">France</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a>-dominated <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> competed for continental domination while the Dutch Republic and England <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Wars">fought several wars</a> over naval hegemony. At the same time, Denmark sought to rid itself of the generous toll treaties it was forced to grant Dutch merchants after the Republic's assistance in the wars against Sweden. Attempts were made to ally with both England and France, but without success. In the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a> (1665–66) Denmark had to side with the Dutch at the <a href="Battle%20of%20V%C3%A5gen">Battle of Vågen</a>, souring its relations with England. In 1670 France allied with England against the Republic. Sweden's relations with France had improved greatly and in 1672 it joined the Anglo-French coalition, pushing Denmark into the Dutch camp.

In 1672, French King <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> launched an attack on the Dutch Republic, igniting the <a href="Franco-Dutch%20War">Franco-Dutch War</a>. The attack was opposed by the Holy Roman Empire led by <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold I</a>. In 1674, Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies only on the condition that it moved in force on <a href="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg</a>. A Swedish army of around 22,000 men under <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Wrangel">Carl Gustaf Wrangel</a> advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fehrbellin">Battle of Fehrbellin</a> in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Sweden had enjoyed since the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> and emboldened its enemies. By September 1675, Denmark, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire and <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a> were all joined in war against Sweden and its ally France.

With the declaration of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, Denmark saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces. The southern Baltic became an important strategic theatre for both Denmark and Sweden. Denmark needed the sea lanes to invade Scania, and Sweden needed to reinforce <a href="Swedish%20Pomerania">Swedish Pomerania</a> on the Baltic coast; both stood to gain by taking control of the Baltic trade routes. As war broke out between Denmark and Sweden a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.

In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under <a href="Gustaf%20Otto%20Stenbock">Gustaf Otto Stenbock</a> put to sea, but sailed no further than <a href="Stora%20Karls%C3%B6">Stora Karlsö</a> off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, and the loss of vital equipment. Stenbock, held personally responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.

The <a href="First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">First Anglo-Dutch War</a> (1652–54) saw the development of the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s at an enemy. Previously, decisive action in naval engagements had been achieved through boarding and melee, but after the middle of the 17th century tactical doctrine focused more on disabling or sinking an opponent through superior firepower from a distance. This entailed major changes in military doctrines, <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a>, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored very large ships that could hold the line in the face of heavy fire, later known as <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>. The new tactics also depended on the ability of strong, centralized governments to maintain large, permanent fleets led by a professional officer corps. The increased power of the state at the expense of individual landowners led to the expansion of armies and navies, and in the late 1660s Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program.

In 1675, the Swedish fleet was numerically superior to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16 and 21 frigates against 11), but it was older and of poorer quality than the Danish fleet, which had replaced a larger proportion of its vessels. The Swedes had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who commonly had valuable experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish navy also lacked a core of professional officers. The Danish had seasoned veterans like <a href="Cort%20Adeler">Cort Adeler</a> and <a href="Niels%20Juel">Niels Juel</a>. The Danish fleet was also reinforced with Dutch units under the command <a href="Philip%20van%20Almonde">Philip van Almonde</a> and <a href="Cornelis%20Tromp">Cornelis Tromp</a>, the latter an experienced officer who had served under <a href="Michiel%20de%20Ruyter">Michiel de Ruyter</a>, famous for his skilled command in the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

A Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 warships of over 50 guns, 21 of less than 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left <a href="Visby">Visby</a>, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between the southern tip of Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a> to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive <a href="battle%20of%20Bornholm%20%281676%29">battle at Bornholm</a>. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's <a href="fireship">fireship</a>s were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.

Several Swedish accounts say that Creutz argued with his officers after Bornholm. Major Taube of the "Mars" testified that after the battle, the officers had been "scolded like boys" and that Creutz, "without regard for guilt or innocence, accused them almost all alike". The army captain Rosenberg told a later inquiry that Creutz "almost had a paroxysm in the night" over the conduct of Johan Bär (one of his <a href="flag%20officer">flag officer</a>s) at Bornholm, and that he swore "never to go to serve at sea with such rascals". Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has concluded that the relationship between Creutz and his subordinates had hit rock bottom before the battle.

After the unsuccessful action the Swedish fleet anchored off <a href="Trelleborg">Trelleborg</a>, where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to refuse combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. After the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May, the allied fleet soon came in contact with it and began pursuing the Swedes. By this time the allies had been reinforced by a small squadron and now totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large or medium ships of the line. The reinforcements also brought with them a new commander, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest naval tacticians of his time. Tromp, who also was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch navy, was made Admiral-General of the Danish navy on 8 May 1676. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a <a href="Beaufort%20scale">strong gale</a>. The rough winds were hard on the Swedish ships. Many lost masts and spars. The Swedes, forming a barely cohesive battle line, tried to sail ahead of Tromp's ships, hoping to get between them and the shore, thus putting themselves on the allied fleet's <a href="windward%20side">windward side</a> and gaining the tactical advantage of holding the <a href="weather%20gage">weather gage</a>. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail <a href="close%20hauled">closer to the wind</a> and faster than the rest of the force, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, snatching the weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed on each other, and were soon within firing range.

Around noon, as a result of poor coordination and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship "<a href="Kronan%20%28ship%29">Kronan</a>" came about in the maneuver it suddenly <a href="heeling%20%28sailing%29">heeled</a> over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not <a href="reefing">reefed</a> and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower <a href="gunport">gunport</a>s. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. "Kronan" quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.

The sudden loss of the flagship and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that the flagship was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship "Svärdet" came on a collision course with the still floating wreckage of "Kronan", and were forced to <a href="Jibe%20%28sailing%29">jibe</a> (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. "Svärdet"s second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.

Tromp on "Christianus Quintus", Vice Admiral Jens Rodsten on "Tre Løver" and Niels Juel on "Churprindsen" took advantage of the chaos. They quickly surrounded "Svärdet" and three supporting ships ("Hieronymus", "Neptunus" and "Järnvågen", an armed merchantman) and began to hammer them into submission. Several other Swedish vessels attempted to assist Uggla, but they were in a lee position and could not provide effective support. After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of hard fighting "Svärdet"s <a href="mast%20%28sailing%29">mainmast</a> went overboard and Uggla had to surrender to Tromp. Despite this, "Svärdet" was ignited by accident or misunderstanding by the Dutch fireship "t Hoen". The second largest Swedish ship after "Kronan" sank in the blaze and took with it 600 out of a crew of 650, including Admiral Uggla himself. Only "Hieronymus" escaped the assault by the allied admirals, though badly damaged, and the others were captured by Juel on "Churprindsen" together with one of his lieutenants on "Anna Sophia".

By six o'clock in the evening the Swedes had lost two flagships along with two fleet admirals, including the supreme commander of the navy. The entire force now began a disorderly retreat: the smaller ships "Enhorn", "Ekorren", "Gripen" and "Sjöhästen" were outsailed and captured and the rest of the ships sought shelter in friendly harbors. Most set course for <a href="Dalar%C3%B6">Dalarö</a>, north of Stockholm; others tried for <a href="Kalmar%20Strait">Kalmar Strait</a>, between Öland and the Swedish mainland. The allied fleet tried to capitalize further on its victory by giving chase, but the dash up the coast had scattered its forces and there was disagreement among the Danish commanders on how far they should pursue the Swedish ships.

The Swedish fleet had suffered a major blow by losing its two largest ships, its commander-in-chief and one of its most experienced admirals. Even after the battle, the misfortunes continued. "Äpplet" came off its moorings at Dalarö, went aground and sank. Around fifty survivors were picked up by pursuing Danish ships and taken as prisoners to Copenhagen. The battle gave Denmark undisputed naval supremacy and the Swedish fleet did not dare to venture out for the rest of the year. The army that had been amassed in Denmark could now be shipped to Scania to take the war to Swedish soil and on 29 June 1676, 14,500 troops were landed at <a href="R%C3%A5%C3%A5">Råå</a> south of <a href="Helsingborg">Helsingborg</a>. The Battle of Öland was the first major Swedish defeat at sea to Denmark and was followed by further Swedish defeats at <a href="battle%20of%20M%C3%B8n">Møn</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B8ge%20Bay%20%281677%29">Køge Bay</a> in 1677. The latter was a resounding success for Admiral Niels Juel and has become the most celebrated victory in Danish naval history.

The Battle of Öland was the first of several major Swedish defeats at sea that ended in complete Danish dominance over the southern Baltic for the duration of the Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an ice-free harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a>. The lessons from the war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of <a href="Hans%20Wachtmeister">Hans Wachtmeister</a> (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment of skilled personnel through the <a href="allotment%20system">allotment system</a>.

Within a week, the news of the failure at Bornholm and the major defeat at Öland reached King Charles, who immediately ordered that a commission be set up to investigate what had happened. Charles wanted to see if Bär and other officers were guilty of cowardice or incompetence. On 13 June, the King wrote "some of our sea officers have shown such cowardly and careless behavior" that they have "placed the safety, welfare and defense of the kingdom at great peril", and that "such a serious crime should be severely punished".

The commission began its work on 7 June 1676. At the hearings, strong criticism surfaced and was directed against individual officers as well as Swedish conduct in general. Anders Homman, one of the officers on "Svärdet", was among those who chastised his colleagues the hardest. In his testimony he said that Admiral Uggla had exclaimed "look how those dog cunts run" when he was surrounded, fighting the allied flagships. Homman himself described the actions of his colleagues as those of "chickens running about the yard, each in his own direction", and added that he "had been in seven battles, but had never seen our people fight so poorly".

The commission did not find anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of "Nyckeln", and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who had run aground on "Äpplet", were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of "Solen", went through the process unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently been blamed for the loss of his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture by pointing out that Creutz's task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.

Despite the victories, several allied officers were displeased with the conduct of their forces. Naval historian Jørgen Barfod explains that the battle was fought "in a disorganized manner from beginning to end" since Tromp had given the order for each commander to attack the enemy ship closest to him. Most of the Danish fleet was unable to keep pace with the faster Dutch ships, so the race for an advantageous position along the coast had contributed to the scattering of the allied fleet. Juel later complained in a letter to the Danish Admiral of the Realm that the Dutch had not assisted him in pursuing the fleeing Swedes. He claimed that if he had received proper support, they could have "brought [the Swedes] such a fever on their throats that it would take years for all the doctors in Stockholm to cure it". When Tromp sent a report of the battle to the Danish King he reproached his subordinates, but not by name, and asked that no punishment be dealt out.

The captain of "t Hoen", the fireship that had set "Svärdet" ablaze after she had surrendered, was arrested and incarcerated directly after the battle, and was subjected to such harsh treatment that he died within a few days. Tromp later reported that his ship "Delft", which had seen some of the roughest fighting, had lost around 100 men and that most of its officers were wounded.

Below is a list of the ships that participated in the battle. The figures in parentheses indicate the number of guns for each ship.

Ralph Neville (or Ralf Nevill; died 1244) was a medieval clergyman and politician who served as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Lord%20Chancellors%20and%20Lord%20Keepers">Lord Chancellor</a> of England. Neville first appears in the historical record in 1207 in the service of King <a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a>, and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life. By 1213 Neville had custody of the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a> of England, although he was not named chancellor, the office responsible for the seal, until 1226. He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222. Although he was also briefly <a href="List%20of%20Archbishops%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop-elect of Canterbury</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop-elect of Winchester</a>, both elections were set aside, or quashed, and he held neither office.

As keeper of the seal, and subsequently as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number of changes in the way the <a href="chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a> operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed <a href="Chancery%20Lane">Chancery Lane</a> owing to his connection with the chancery.

Neville, who was illegitimate, had at least three brothers: Nicholas de Neville, a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> at <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a>; William de Neville, treasurer of the <a href="see%20of%20Chichester">see of Chichester</a>; and Robert de Neville, holder of a <a href="prebend">prebend</a> at Chichester. The identity of their father is unknown, but another likely sibling was Roger, who held land in Lincolnshire. Robert became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Nicholas a baron of the Exchequer. Ralph Neville was also related to <a href="Hugh%20de%20Neville">Hugh de Neville</a>, King John of England's <a href="chief%20forester">chief forester</a>.

Neville was a royal clerk to King John in the spring of 1207, and in December of that year was at <a href="Marlborough%20Castle">Marlborough Castle</a> on royal business. Earlier references to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville's chaplain, may be to the future bishop, but the evidence is inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.

Neville's activities during the years immediately after 1207 are unknown, owing to the lack of royal records, but in December 1213 he was given custody of the Great Seal of the kingdom. He was <a href="Dean%20of%20Lichfield">Dean of Lichfield</a> by 11 April 1214, at which time he held a prebend in the <a href="diocese%20of%20London">diocese of London</a>. Neville was appointed to the royal chancery in about 1214, largely through the patronage of <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and one of the king's favourites. From March to October 1214, Neville was in France with the king. After the king returned to England after 1214, Neville remained in royal service until at least May 1216, although without custody of the Great Seal. His activities during the final period of John's reign prior to the king's sudden death in October 1216 are unknown.

Neville was keeper of the royal seal under the new king, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> (r. 1216–1272) from about 6 November 1218. He had been at the royal court since May 1218, and was given custody of the seal as soon as it was made up. One of the first documents subsequently sealed was a declaration that no charters or other rights would be granted in perpetuity until Henry attained his majority. Neville was also vice-chancellor of England under the chancellorship of <a href="Richard%20Marsh%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Durham">Richard Marsh</a>, who had been elected as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> in 1217 and spent most of his time attending to ecclesiastical affairs in his northern diocese. In fact, if not in name, Neville was responsible for all the duties of the chancellorship, and he exercised most of the power of that office, although Marsh continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death in 1226. When instability threatened the royal government in May and June 1219 Neville was ordered by <a href="Pandulf%20Verraccio">Pandulf</a>, the papal legate, to remain in London with the Great Seal while a royal council was held at Gloucester. The council resulted in royal government coming under the control of <a href="Hubert%20de%20Burgh">Hubert de Burgh</a> the <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a>, Pandulf, and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.

Neville received a papal <a href="Dispensation%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">dispensation</a> for his <a href="illegitimacy">illegitimacy</a> on 25 January 1220, on the recommendation of the king, <a href="Stephen%20Langton">Stephen Langton</a> the Archbishop of Canterbury, other bishops, and the papal legate Cardinal <a href="Guala%20Bicchieri">Guala Bicchieri</a>, all of whom testified to his good reputation and character. In late October he was named chancellor of the see of Chichester, but was then elected Bishop of Chichester on about 1 November 1222. He was given control of the <a href="temporalities">temporalities</a> of the bishopric on 3 November 1222, and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. In April 1223 Neville was ordered by Pope <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Honorius III</a> to cease using the Great Seal on the command of the justiciar or other members of the minority council, but instead to do so only at the king's command, essentially ending the royal minority. But it did not finally end until December 1223, and even then, as the king had not yet been officially declared of age, the ban on grants without a fixed time limit remained in force.

Neville was named Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The appointment was made by the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department that was part of the royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the <a href="liberate%20roll">liberate roll</a>s from the <a href="letters%20close">letters close</a> in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the <a href="Charter%20Roll">Charter Roll</a>s in 1227. He also issued <a href="writ">writ</a>s on his own authority, the so-called writs "de cursu". Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.

Surviving letters from the <a href="precentor">precentor</a> of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to celebrate the Easter Mass and to deal with pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the <a href="Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a> or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.

Neville was elected Archbishop of Canterbury on about 24 September 1231 by the monks of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury</a>, but his election was quashed in early 1232 by Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20IX">Gregory IX</a>, on the grounds that Neville was an "illiteratus" or illiterate, even though he had been found to be "literatus" in 1214 when appointed dean; "literatus" in this sense meant "learned" rather than "literate". Other concerns were that <a href="Simon%20Langton%20%28priest%29">Simon Langton</a>, the <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Canterbury">Archdeacon of Canterbury</a>, described Neville as a courtier instead of a true priest, and claimed that Neville's goal was to free England from its feudal ties to the papacy.

As well as his chancery duties, Neville occasionally sat with the <a href="barons%20of%20the%20exchequer">barons of the exchequer</a> or with <a href="royal%20justice">royal justice</a>s, and he had a role in the appointment of royal justices. In 1230 he was regent of England while Henry was absent in France, during which time he met with <a href="Llywelyn%20the%20Great">Llywelyn the Great</a> in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an agreement that would resolve the disputes between the English and the Welsh. In 1232, during the events surrounding the de Burgh's downfall Neville, along with <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Blondeville%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>, urged that de Burgh should not be dragged from <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> to face the royal accusations against him. Neville's pleas prevailed for a time, but eventually de Burgh was removed from sanctuary.

The king attempted to deprive Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the bishop countered by claiming that as he had been appointed during the royal minority with the consent of the great council, only the council could dismiss him. In 1238 the cathedral chapter of the <a href="see%20of%20Winchester">see of Winchester</a> elected as Bishop of Winchester first <a href="William%20de%20Raley">William de Raley</a> in opposition to the king's choice of <a href="William%20of%20Savoy">William</a> the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Valence">Bishop of Valence</a>, and when that election was quashed, they elected Neville. His election to Winchester was quashed in 1239, leading to a quarrel with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Provence">Eleanor of Provence</a>, whom Henry had married in 1236. Valence had gained much influence with the king quite quickly, and worked to eliminate the older royal officials and institute reforms in the royal administration. This, along with the disputed election to Winchester, was the cause of Neville's fall from favour. Although Henry deprived Neville of the custody of the Great Seal from 1238 until 1242, Neville retained the title of chancellor until his death, thus entitling him to the revenues he would normally have received from the office. The Great Seal itself was held by a number of minor officials, probably to allow Henry greater control over its use by preventing the establishment of another powerful official who might interfere with his plans. But they lacked the power base that Neville had possessed, which enabled him to oppose the king.

In 1239 Neville may have been offered the custody of the Great Seal, which he refused. In May 1242 Neville was once again responsible for the seal while Henry was in France, a responsibility apparently shared with the regent. After the king's return in September 1243 Neville did seal a few documents with the Great Seal until his death a few months later.

Neville died between 1 and 4 February 1244 at the palace he had built in London in what was then New Street, subsequently renamed Chancery Lane because of his being Lord Chancellor. He was buried in Chichester Cathedral, behind the high altar. After Neville's death Matthew Paris described him as "a man laudable in all things, and a pillar of fidelity in the business of the kingdom and the king". Some of the provisions of his will are known: he left some jewellery and gems to the king, some of his lands were given to his successors as bishop, and other lands and items were bequeathed to his cathedral chapter at Chichester. He also endowed a distribution of bread to the poor residents of Chichester, a gift that continued into the 20th century. Neville also endowed a chapel near Chichester with two clergy to pray for the soul of King John.

Many of Neville's letters survive, as they were collected by him during his lifetime. They are currently in the <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Archives</a> of the United Kingdom, having previously formed part of the <a href="Public%20Record%20Office">Public Record Office</a>. The letters were published in "Sussex Archaeological Collections" volume 3 in 1850 and were edited by <a href="William%20Henry%20Blaauw">William Henry Blaauw</a>. Neville was instrumental in promoting the career of his brother William, but non-relatives also benefited from his patronage: one of Neville's clerks, <a href="Silvester%20de%20Everdon">Silvester de Everdon</a>, was a member of the chancery until 1246, when he was selected as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Carlisle">Bishop of Carlisle</a>.

Johnstown Inclined Plane

The Johnstown Inclined Plane is a <a href="funicular">funicular</a> in <a href="Johnstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Johnstown</a>, <a href="Cambria%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cambria County</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The incline and its two stations connect the city of Johnstown, situated in a valley at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="Stonycreek%20River">Stonycreek</a> and the <a href="Little%20Conemaugh%20River">Little Conemaugh</a> Rivers, to the <a href="borough%20%28Pennsylvania%29">borough</a> of <a href="Westmont%2C%20Pennsylvania">Westmont</a> on Yoder Hill. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is billed as the "world's steepest vehicular inclined plane", as it is capable of carrying automobiles, in addition to passengers, up or down a slope with a <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> of 70.9 percent. The travel time from one station to the other is 90 seconds.

After a <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">catastrophic flood in 1889</a>, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was completed in 1891 to serve as an escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by <a href="Cambria%20Iron%20Company">Cambria Iron Company</a> and its successor <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floods—once in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973 and was designated a <a href="Historic%20Mechanical%20Engineering%20Landmark">Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark</a> in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.

The Johnstown Inclined Plane was designed by <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> engineer <a href="Samuel%20Diescher">Samuel Diescher</a>, who had also designed the <a href="Duquesne%20Incline">Duquesne</a>, <a href="Castle%20Shannon%20Incline">Castle Shannon</a> and <a href="Fort%20Pitt%20Incline">Fort Pitt</a> Inclines in Pittsburgh. The funicular consists of a parallel set of <a href="broad%20gauge">broad gauge</a> railroad tracks with a 70.9 percent grade or an angle of 35 degrees and 28 <a href="minute%20of%20arc">minutes</a> from the horizontal. The incline is long and ascends vertically to the top of Yoder Hill and the <a href="borough%20%28Pennsylvania%29">borough</a> of <a href="Westmont%2C%20Pennsylvania">Westmont</a>, the station of which is at an elevation of above sea level. The rails are supported by 720  <a href="railroad%20tie">railroad tie</a>s made from <a href="Southern%20Yellow%20Pine">Southern Yellow Pine</a>. The incline is lit at night by 114 high-pressure <a href="sodium-vapor%20lamp">sodium-vapor lamp</a>s mounted along the sides of tracks. There used to be a stairway between the two tracks with 966 steps, but these were removed circa 1963.
Two cars traverse the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and acts as a <a href="counterweight">counterweight</a>. The cars are wide, tall, and long, and are large enough to carry either 65 people, 6 motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars are open to the elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are , <a href="wire%20rope%23Stranded%20ropes">6×36 right regular lay</a>, steel wire rope. They are wound around a , drum that connects the cars together. The cable on the north track is long, while the south cable is shorter. Each car weighs , but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of . A electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is unusual in that the motor and <a href="winch">winch</a> are located at a 90-degree angle to the incline instead of directly underneath it. Operation of the incline is controlled via a foot pedal located in a booth in the upper station.

An emergency brake engages if the air pressure needed to control the incline is insufficient; the brake also engages if a <a href="dead%20man%27s%20switch">dead man's switch</a> is tripped in the operator's booth. In addition to the hauling cables, a safety cable capable of withstanding is also connected to the cars.

Inclines are common in Europe, and immigrants, like the <a href="Germans">German</a>, <a href="Slavic%20people">Slavic</a>, and <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> people who settled near Johnstown, remembered them from their native lands and brought the concept to the United States. The earliest inclines in the United States were a series of 10 that were built in the 1830s as part of the <a href="Allegheny%20Portage%20Railroad">Allegheny Portage Railroad</a>. The portage railroad carried canal boats over the <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a> to connect the canals from Pittsburgh to the ones from <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Pittsburgh at one time also had "at least 17" inclines—some carried passengers, others freight, while another two inclines (like the <a href="Nunnery%20Hill%20Incline">Nunnery Hill Incline</a>) were curved.

On May 31, 1889, the <a href="South%20Fork%20Dam">South Fork Dam</a> collapsed upstream of Johnstown on the <a href="Little%20Conemaugh%20River">Little Conemaugh River</a>. The <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">resulting deluge</a> devastated the city, killing 2,209 people. As the city rebuilt, the <a href="Cambria%20Iron%20Company">Cambria Iron Company</a> started work on a residential development atop Yoder Hill. To provide easy transportation up and down the steep slope for the residents of the new community of Westmont, the company decided to construct an inclined plane. In addition to being a convenient mode of transportation, the Johnstown Inclined Plane doubled as an escape route in case of another flood. Diescher was hired by Cambria Iron to design the incline. The rails used in the incline were all manufactured in Johnstown at Cambria Iron, with many of the tools needed in the construction also handcrafted there. The <a href="Inclined%20Plane%20Bridge">Inclined Plane Bridge</a> was built to span the <a href="Stoneycreek%20River">Stoneycreek River</a> to provide access to the lower station of the incline. Originally named the Cambria Inclined Plane, the Johnstown Inclined Plane opened on June 1, 1891 and cost <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>133,296 to build. The convenience the incline provided stimulated a rapid growth of population in Westmont and made the borough one of the country's first suburbs. Over 40 million trips were taken on the incline in its first 80 years of operation.

The incline's original steam engine was disconnected on January 6, 1912, and replaced with an electric motor. The cars used on the incline were originally double-deckers, but were reconfigured into a single-decker design in 1921. The double-decker cars had horses and wagons riding on the main, upper deck and passengers riding in a compartment below. Only one human fatality has occurred at the incline, though it was determined that the incident was not caused by the incline itself. There were two incidents in the 1920s when horses aboard the incline became spooked and leapt from the car onto the tracks below. <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a>, the successor to Cambria Iron, sold the Johnstown Inclined Plane to the borough of Westmont in April 1935. On March 17, 1936, nearly 4,000 people were evacuated from Johnstown to higher ground via the incline as the Stoneycreek and <a href="Conemaugh%20River">Conemaugh</a> Rivers overflowed their banks. The floodwaters continued downstream and <a href="Pittsburgh%20Flood%20of%201936">eventually reached Pittsburgh</a>. From February 1938 to July 1953, the <a href="Johnstown%20Traction%20Company">Johnstown Traction Company</a> operated <a href="transit%20bus">transit bus</a>es from Johnstown to Westmont with the "fully loaded public buses" being carried by the incline. Bethlehem Steel stopped supplying electricity to the Johnstown Inclined Plane when the factory switched to "an incompatible power system", forcing the incline to close on January 31, 1962. Because of public pressure to keep the incline operating, it was reopened in July 1962 after an extensive renovation, in which the electric motor was rewound, ties were replaced, and the cars were repainted.

The Johnstown Inclined Plane was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on June 18, 1973. On July 20, 1977, the incline was again used as an escape route, evacuating residents from the valley amid rising floodwaters. It also carried "boats, <a href="emergency%20service">emergency personnel</a>, and equipment down to the valley to aid in rescue operations". The incline was again sold for $1 by Westmont borough on March 8, 1983, to the Cambria County Transit Authority, now <a href="CamTran">CamTran</a>. CamTran initiated a $4.2 million renovation on September 7, 1983, replacing "the incline's foundation piers, structural steel, and track." The renovations were completed on August 22, 1984, and the incline was rededicated on September 6. It was designated an <a href="Historic%20Mechanical%20Engineering%20Landmark">Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark</a> by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Mechanical%20Engineers">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</a> (ASME) in September 1994. A footbridge spanning <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2056">Pennsylvania Route 56</a> between the incline and Vine Street was opened around the same time. On September 1, 2000, the incline was closed when the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> (PennDOT) undertook an $2.3 million renovation of the bridge and the access road leading to the bridge. It was reopened in April 2001, but again closed in September to allow PennDOT to finish repairs to the bridge deck. The repairs were completed on December 14, 2001. A strong thunderstorm disrupted power to the incline on April 16, 2010, stranding the cars and two passengers almost halfway down the slope; the rescue took three hours and ended when firefighters <a href="abseiling">rappel</a>led down the tracks to reach the car. The Johnstown Inclined Plane was closed from September 9 to October 14, 2010, for the installation of a new "hoist brake shaft." From October 29 to October 31, 2012, CamTran shut down the incline fearing power outages due to the passage of <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. During the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, two <a href="resistor">resistor</a>s failed and stopped the incline just outside the stations on June 28, 2014; repairs took approximately a month after having experts brought in diagnose the failure. Sensor issues briefly disrupted service in August 2014 and, again, December 2014 forcing the incline to start its winter maintenance period early.

With the growing popularity of the automobile and subsequent construction of new roads, ridership on the incline diminished and it was losing $25,000 a year by 1961. However, since the 1980s, the incline has become one of the main tourist attractions in Johnstown, with people visiting the incline to "ride for fun, nostalgia and novelty." Though primarily used for tourism, the incline's use by commuters, who bike or walk to work, has also increased. CamTran's Route 18 <a href="transit%20bus">transit bus</a> offers connections between the incline and downtown Johnstown. , the cost for a ride on the incline is $3 or $5 for a roundtrip; fares for automobiles to be transported by the incline are $8 one way. The incline takes around 90 seconds to travel from one station to the other; the same trip takes 10 minutes by automobile. In 2016, the Johnstown Inclined Plane had an annual ridership of 65,268 passengers, an increase of 49.5 percent from the previous year.

The upper station of the incline has a gift shop that sells souvenirs and snack foods; a visitor center is also located adjacent to the station. The <a href="mechanical%20room">mechanical room</a> housing the incline's electric motor and hoisting mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and the lobby of the visitor center. An <a href="observation%20deck">observation deck</a> providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located on the opposite side of the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a <a href="sculpture%20trail">sculpture trail</a>, with works created in 1989 by local artist <a href="James%20Wolfe%20%28artist%29">James Wolfe</a>, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.

SMS Schleswig-Holstein

SMS "Schleswig-Holstein" () was the last of the five s built by the German <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>. The ship, named for the province of <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Province">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, was laid down in the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in August 1905 and commissioned into the fleet nearly three years later. The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service, being inferior in size, armor, firepower and speed to the new generation of <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> battleships.

"Schleswig-Holstein" fought in both World Wars. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, she saw front-line service in the II Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, culminating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916. "Schleswig-Holstein" saw action during the engagement, and was hit by one large-caliber shell. After the battle, "Schleswig-Holstein" was relegated to guard duty in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe%20River">Elbe River</a> before being decommissioned in late 1917. As one of the few battleships permitted for Germany by the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, "Schleswig-Holstein" was again pressed into fleet service in the 1920s. In 1935, the old battleship was converted into a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for naval cadets.

"Schleswig-Holstein" fired the first shots of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when she <a href="Battle%20of%20Westerplatte">bombarded the Polish base</a> at <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>'s <a href="Westerplatte">Westerplatte</a> in the early morning hours of 1 September 1939. The ship was used as a training vessel for the majority of the war, and was sunk by British bombers in <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a> in December 1944. "Schleswig-Holstein" was subsequently salvaged and then beached for use by the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> as a target. As of 1990, the ship's bell was on display in the <a href="Bundeswehr%20Military%20History%20Museum">Bundeswehr Military History Museum</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

The passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> in 1900 under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s, and shortly thereafter design work began on a follow-on design, which became the . The "Deutschland"-class ships were broadly similar to the "Braunschweig"s and featured incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s to save weight. The British battleship armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) gunswas commissioned in December 1906. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered obsolete every capital ship of the German navy, including "Schleswig-Holstein".

"Schleswig-Holstein" had a length of , a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Full%20or%20deep%20load%20or%20loaded%20displacement">combat loading</a>. She was equipped with three <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s and twelve coal-fired <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s that produced a rated and a top speed of . In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, "Schleswig-Holstein" was the second-most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for . She had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men.

The ship's primary armament consisted of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm SK L/40 gun</a>s in two twin turrets; one turret was placed forward and the other aft. She was also equipped with fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">SK L/40</a> guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and twenty <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">SK L/35</a> guns in pivot mounts. The ship was also armed with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all below the waterline. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Her <a href="belt%20armor">armored belt</a> was thick <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, and she had a thick armored deck. The main battery turrets had thick sides.

"Schleswig-Holstein" was laid down on 18 August 1905 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. She was launched on 17 December 1906, the last pre-dreadnought battleship of the German navy. At "Schleswig-Holstein"s launching ceremony, she was christened by <a href="Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein</a>, the German Empress; <a href="Wilhelm%20II%20of%20Germany">Wilhelm II</a> was also in attendance. <a href="Ernst%20Gunther%2C%20Duke%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Ernst Gunther</a>, the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, gave the commissioning speech.

Upon completion, "Schleswig-Holstein" was commissioned for <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 6 July 1908. Her crew largely came from her sister ship . On 21 September the ship was assigned to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, alongside her sister ships. In November, fleet and unit exercises were conducted in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The training regimen in which "Schleswig-Holstein" participated followed a similar pattern over the next five years. Fleet maneuvers were conducted in the spring, followed by a summer cruise to <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, and additional fleet training in the fall. This included another cruise into the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>, from 7 July to 1 August 1909.

Starting in September 1910, <a href="Friedrich%20Boedicker">Friedrich Boedicker</a> took command of the ship, a position he held for the next three years. On 3 October 1911, the ship was transferred back to the II Squadron. Due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a> in July, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic. In 1913, she won the Kaiser's "Schiesspreis" (Gunnery Award). On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began, but the threat of war in Europe cut the excursion short; within two weeks "Schleswig-Holstein" and the rest of the II Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven.

At the outbreak of war in July 1914, "Schleswig-Holstein" was assigned to guard duty in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe%20River">Elbe River</a> while the rest of the fleet mobilized. In late October, she and her sisters were sent to Kiel to have improvements made to their underwater protection system to make them more resistant to torpedoes and <a href="Naval%20mine">mine</a>s, after which the II Battle Squadron rejoined the fleet. The squadron covered Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> while they <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. During the operation, the German battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens convinced the German commander, Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, that he was confronted with the entire <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, and so he broke off the engagement and turned the fleet for home. In April 1916, the ship had two of her 8.8 cm guns removed and replaced with 8.8 cm <a href="Flak">Flak</a> guns.

"Schleswig-Holstein" then participated in a fleet advance to the <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> on 21–22 April 1915. On 11–12 September, the II Reconnaissance Group conducted a minelaying operation off the <a href="Swarte%20Bank">Swarte Bank</a> with the II Squadron in support. This was followed by another sweep by the fleet on 23–24 October that ended without result. The II and III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts conducted an advance into the North Sea on 5–7 March 1916; "Schleswig-Holstein" and the rest of the II Squadron remained in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, ready to sail in support. They then rejoined the fleet during the operation to <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombard Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a> on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Visibility was poor, so the operation was quickly called off before the British fleet could intervene.

The commander of the High Seas Fleet, Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, immediately planned another advance into the North Sea, but the damage to "Seydlitz" delayed the operation until the end of May. As the last ship assigned to the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron, the rearmost German formation, "Schleswig-Holstein" was the last battleship in the line. The II Battle Squadron was commanded by Rear Admiral . During the "Run to the North", Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British 5th Battle Squadron at top speed. "Schleswig-Holstein" and her sisters were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind. During this period, Admiral Scheer directed to place herself behind "Schleswig-Holstein" so he would have a flagship on either end of the formation. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Admiral Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower "Deutschland"-class ships; if Scheer had ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have had to sacrifice the slower ships to make his escape.

Admiral Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the "Gefechtskehrtwendung", a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. Having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn, and fell to the disengaged side of the German line. Admiral Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line. But by the time the II Squadron reached its position at the head of the line, Scheer had ordered another "Gefechtskehrtwendung", which placed them at the rear of the German fleet. By 21:00, Scheer had turned the fleet around a third time, but the slow speed of "Schleswig-Holstein" and her squadron mates caused them to fall out of position, to the disengaged side of the fleet.

Later on the first day of the battle, Hipper's badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their British rivals. "Schleswig-Holstein" and the other so-called "five-minute ships" came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. These ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. The visibility was so bad, the gunners aboard "Schleswig-Holstein" could not make out a target, and she did not fire her main guns. At 21:35 a heavy caliber shell struck the ship on the port-side, punching a hole approximately 40 cm (16 in) wide before exploding against the inner casemate armor. It tore apart of the superstructure deck and disabled one of the port side casemate guns. Three men were killed and nine were wounded. Admiral Mauve halted the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8-<a href="Points%20of%20the%20compass">point</a> turn to starboard.

Late on the 31st, the fleet re-formed for the night voyage back to Germany, with "Schleswig-Holstein" towards the rear of the line, ahead of , "Hannover", and the battlecruisers and . Around 03:00, British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which were directed towards "Schleswig-Holstein". Shortly thereafter, "Pommern" was struck by at least one torpedo from the destroyer ; the hit detonated an ammunition magazine, destroying the ship in a tremendous explosion. During the attack, "Schleswig-Holstein" was forced to turn away to avoid the destroyers' torpedoes. Shortly after 05:00, "Hannover" and several other ships fired repeatedly at what they falsely believed to be British submarines.

Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 4:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the and es took up defensive positions. Over the course of the battle, "Schleswig-Holstein" had fired only twenty 17 cm rounds.

"Schleswig-Holstein" was put into dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to withdraw the four remaining "Deutschland"-class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, as demonstrated by the loss of "Pommern". Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April "Schleswig-Holstein" was sent to <a href="Altenbruch">Altenbruch</a> at the mouth of the Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. "Schleswig-Holstein" was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in <a href="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a>. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.

Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the <a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a> according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under —two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. "Schleswig-Holstein" was among the ships that were retained, along with her sisters "Hannover" and "Schlesien" and several of the "Braunschweig"-class battleships. "Schleswig-Holstein" was recommissioned as the new fleet flagship on 31 January 1926 following an extensive refit, with new fire controls and an enlarged aft superstructure for the admiral's staff. The secondary 17 cm guns were replaced with pieces and four 50 cm torpedo tubes were fitted in main deck casemates fore and aft, replacing the submerged tubes.

"Schleswig-Holstein" and her sister "Hannover" went on a training cruise into the Atlantic that lasted from 14 May to 17 June 1926; while on the cruise, she visited <a href="Palma%20de%20Mallorca">Palma de Mallorca</a> in the Mediterranean from 22 to 30 May. She stopped in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> with from 1 to 7 June, and then proceeded to <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> from 12 to 14 June, where she joined "Hessen", "Elsass", and "Hannover". There, the chief of the fleet, Vice Admiral Konrad Mommsen, met with <a href="King%20Alfonso%20XIII">King Alfonso XIII</a>. "Schleswig-Holstein" went on another training cruise between 30 March and 14 June 1927 into the Atlantic. She visited a series of Iberian ports, including <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Portugal, where Mommsen was greeted by <a href="%C3%93scar%20Carmona">Óscar Carmona</a>, the president of Portugal. In December 1927 "Schleswig-Holstein" went back into dock, re-emerging in January 1928 with her forefunnel trunked back into the second and both remaining funnels heightened, as had previously been done with her sister "Schlesien".

With the delivery of the new "Panzerschiffe" (armored ships) beginning in 1933, the older battleships were gradually withdrawn from front-line service. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was reorganized as the <a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a> by the reforms instituted by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> that created the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>. "Schleswig-Holstein" ceased to be fleet flagship on 22 September 1935, and was refitted as a cadet training ship during January–March and May–July 1936. The changes included removing her remaining upper deck 15 cm guns and her torpedo tubes, and her two aft boiler rooms were converted to oil-firing models, although the forward boilers remained coal-fired. The ship's standard complement was also reduced from 35 officers and 708 enlisted men to 31 officers and 565 sailors. The crew was supplemented by 175 cadets, who were taken on long cruises in "Schlesien" and "Schleswig-Holstein", the latter sailing in October 1936 on a six-month voyage to South America and the Caribbean. The following year, her cruise took her around Africa, and the 1938–39 cruise went back to South American and Caribbean waters. <a href="Gustav%20Kieseritzky">Gustav Kieseritzky</a> served as the ship's commander from June 1938 until April 1939.

In the mid-1930s, Hitler began pursuing an increasingly aggressive foreign policy; in 1936 he <a href="Remilitarization%20of%20the%20Rhineland">re-militarized the Rhineland</a>, and in 1938 completed the <a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a> of Austria and the annexation of Czechoslovakia. He then demanded German control over the city of <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Danzig</a>, which had become a <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Danzig">free city</a> after World War I.

Early on 1 September 1939, Germany launched an <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a>. "Schleswig-Holstein" had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at <a href="Westerplatte">Westerplatte</a> under the guise of a <a href="ceremonial%20visit">ceremonial visit</a> in August. Around 04:47 on 1 September, "Schleswig-Holstein" opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Westerplatte">Battle of Westerplatte</a> was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by "Schleswig-Holstein", though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.

"Schleswig-Holstein" was joined on 4 September by the torpedo boats <a href="SMS%20G196">"T196"</a> and <a href="German%20minesweeper%20M%20107">"Von der Gröben"</a>. A force of German infantry and army engineers went ashore to take the fortress, with heavy fire support from "Schleswig-Holstein". The Poles managed to hold off the Germans until they were forced to surrender on 7 September at 10:30. Following the Polish surrender, "Schleswig-Holstein" began shelling Polish positions at <a href="Hel%2C%20Poland">Hel</a> and <a href="Red%C5%82owo">Redłowo</a>; these operations lasted until 13 September. Between 25 and 27 September, the old battleship returned to Hel with her sister "Schlesien"; both vessels conducted further bombardments of still-manned Polish positions there.

The German military then turned its attention westward, and in April 1940 <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Denmark%20%281940%29">invaded Denmark</a>. "Schleswig-Holstein" was assigned to the naval component of the invasion force. During the invasion, the ship was briefly grounded off the Danish coast. Following the operation, she was transferred back to training duties, as the flagship of the Chief of Training Units. At the end of 1943, the reactivation of "Schleswig-Holstein" was once again contemplated. In her favor was the fact that she retained some coal-fired boilers, given the ever-worsening oil-supply situation. Thus, on 1 February 1944 she was once again recommissioned, at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship, then later in the year docking at <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a> (Gdynia) for a refit. She was to be converted into a convoy escort ship with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, but after being hit three times by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> bombers on 18 December 1944, she eventually foundered in shallow water. As the ship was permanently disabled, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of <a href="Malbork">Marienburg</a>.

Following the Soviet capture of that city, the remaining crew detonated <a href="scuttling">scuttling</a> charges in the wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> and transferred to <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of <a href="Osmussaar">Osmussaar</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>. Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell was held in the collection of the <a href="Military%20History%20Museum%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr">Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> as of 1990.

May Revolution

The May Revolution () was a week-long series of events that took place from May 18 to 25, 1810, in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, capital of the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a>. This Spanish colony included roughly the territories of present-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil. The result was the removal of <a href="Viceroy%23Spanish%20Empire">Viceroy</a> <a href="Baltasar%20Hidalgo%20de%20Cisneros">Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros</a> and the establishment of a local government, the <a href="Primera%20Junta">Primera Junta</a> ("First Junta"), on May 25. It was the first successful revolution in the South American Independence process.

The May Revolution was a direct reaction to Spain's <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>. In 1808, King <a href="Ferdinand%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII of Spain</a> <a href="Abdications%20of%20Bayonne">abdicated</a> in favor of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, who granted the throne to his brother, <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a>. A <a href="Supreme%20Central%20and%20Governing%20Junta%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20%28Spain%29">Supreme Central Junta</a> led resistance to Joseph's government and the French occupation of Spain, but eventually suffered <a href="Peninsular%20War%23Napoleon%27s%20campaign%20%28October%201808%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20January%201809%29">a series of reversals</a> that resulted in the Spanish loss of the northern half of the country. On February 1, 1810, French troops took Seville and gained control of most of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. The Supreme Junta retreated to <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> and dissolved itself, and the <a href="Supreme%20Central%20and%20Governing%20Junta%20of%20the%20Kingdom%23The%20Council%20of%20Regency%20of%20Spain%20and%20the%20Indies">Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies</a> replaced it. News of these events arrived in Buenos Aires on May 18, brought by British ships.

Viceroy Cisneros tried to maintain the political status quo, but a group of <a href="criollo%20people">criollo</a> lawyers and military officials organized an <a href="open%20cabildo">open cabildo</a> (a special meeting of notables of the city) on May 22 to decide the future of the Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the Council of Regency in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros, since the government that had appointed him Viceroy no longer existed. To maintain a sense of continuity, Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However, this caused much popular unrest, so he resigned under pressure on May 25. The newly formed government, the Primera Junta, included only representatives from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not.

The May Revolution began the <a href="Argentine%20War%20of%20Independence">Argentine War of Independence</a>, although no formal declaration of independence was issued at the time and the Primera Junta continued to govern in the name of the deposed king, Ferdinand VII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the <a href="Spanish%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">Spanish American wars of independence</a>. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. <a href="Argentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">A formal declaration of independence</a> was finally issued at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n">Congress of Tucumán</a> on July 9, 1816.

The United States' <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declaration of independence</a> from Great Britain in 1776 led <a href="criollo%20people">criollos</a> (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">American patriots</a> of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> waged the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> against both the local <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">loyalists</a> and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government in the place of the British monarchy. The fact that Spain <a href="Spain%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">aided the colonies</a> in their struggle against Britain weakened the idea that it would be a crime to end one's allegiance to the parent state.

The ideals of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789 spread across Europe and the Americas as well. The overthrow and execution of King <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> and Queen <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> ended centuries of monarchy and removed the privileges of the nobility. Liberal ideals in the political and economic fields developed and spread through the <a href="Atlantic%20Revolutions">Atlantic Revolutions</a> across most of the Western world. The concept of the <a href="divine%20right%20of%20kings">divine right of kings</a> was questioned by the French "<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>", by the oft-quoted statement that "<a href="all%20men%20are%20created%20equal">all men are created equal</a>" in the United States Declaration of Independence and even by the Spanish church.

However, the spread of such ideas was forbidden in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of Louis XVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News of the events of 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">enlightened</a> criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during their university studies, either in Europe or at the <a href="University%20of%20Saint%20Francis%20Xavier">University of Chuquisaca</a> (modern <a href="Sucre">Sucre</a>). Books from the United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.
The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> started in Britain, with the use of <a href="plateway">plateway</a>s, canals and steam power. This led to dramatic increases in the productive capabilities of Britain, and created a need for new markets to sell its products. The <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> with France made this a difficult task, after Napoleon imposed the <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a>, which forbade his allies and conquests to trade with Britain. Thus Britain needed to be able to trade with the Spanish colonies, but could not do so because the colonies were restricted to trade only with their parent state. To achieve their economic objectives, Britain initially <a href="British%20invasions%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">tried to invade Rio de la Plata</a> and conquer key cities in Spanish America. When that failed, they chose to promote the Spanish-American aspirations of emancipation from Spain.

The <a href="mutiny%20of%20Aranjuez">mutiny of Aranjuez</a> in 1808 led King <a href="Charles%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV of Spain</a> to abdicate in favor of his son, <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII</a>. Charles IV requested that Napoleon restore him to the throne; instead, Napoleon crowned his own brother, <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a>, as the new Spanish King. These events are known as the <a href="Abdications%20of%20Bayonne">Abdications of Bayonne</a>. Joseph's coronation was met with severe resistance in Spain, which started the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>, and the <a href="Supreme%20Central%20and%20Governing%20Junta%20of%20the%20Kingdom">Supreme Central Junta</a> took power in the name of the absent king. This also led to Spain switching allegiances from France to Britain. France eventually invaded Sevilla, and a Council of Regency based in <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> replaced the disbanded Supreme Central Junta.

Spain forbade its American colonies to trade with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their international trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would need. This caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, to the detriment of Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though it was illegal, and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because prices would come down.
The Spanish monarchy appointed their own candidates to most of the political offices in the viceroyalty, usually favoring Spaniards from Europe. In most cases, the appointees had little knowledge of or interest in local issues. Consequently, there was a growing rivalry between criollos and <a href="peninsulars">peninsulars</a> (those born in Spain). Most criollos thought that peninsulars had undeserved advantages and received preferential treatment in politics and society. The lower clergy had a similar sentiment about the higher echelons of the religious hierarchy. Events developed at a slower pace than in the United States independence movement. This was in part because the clergy controlled the entire educational system in Spanish America, which led the population to hold the same conservative ideas and follow the same customs as in Spain.

Buenos Aires and <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> successfully resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by <a href="William%20Beresford%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Beresford">William Carr Beresford</a> seized Buenos Aires for a brief time; a Montevidean army led by <a href="Santiago%20de%20Liniers">Santiago de Liniers</a> liberated the city. The following year, a larger army seized Montevideo, but was overwhelmed by the forces of Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Argentina%29">Patricios Regiment</a>, led by <a href="Cornelio%20Saavedra">Cornelio Saavedra</a>, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence that they did not have before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.

The Portuguese royal family left Europe and <a href="Transfer%20of%20the%20Portuguese%20Court%20to%20Brazil">settled in colonial Brazil</a> in 1808, after their escape from the Napoleonic invasion of Portugal. <a href="Carlota%20of%20Spain">Carlota Joaquina</a>, sister of Ferdinand VII, was the wife of the Portuguese prince regent, but had her own political projects. As she avoided the later capture of the Spanish royal family, she attempted to take charge of the viceroyalty as regent. This political project, known as <a href="Carlotism">Carlotism</a>, sought to prevent a French invasion of the Americas. A small secret society of criollos, composed of politicians such as <a href="Manuel%20Belgrano">Manuel Belgrano</a> and <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Castelli">Juan José Castelli</a>, and military leaders such as <a href="Antonio%20Beruti">Antonio Beruti</a> and <a href="Hip%C3%B3lito%20Vieytes">Hipólito Vieytes</a>, supported this project. They considered it an opportunity to get a local government instead of a European one, or a step towards a potential declaration of independence. The project was resisted by Viceroy Liniers, most peninsulars, and some criollos, including Cornelio Saavedra and the lawyers <a href="Mariano%20Moreno">Mariano Moreno</a> and <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Paso">Juan José Paso</a>. They suspected that it concealed Portuguese expansionist ambitions over the region. The supporters of Carlota Joaquina intended her to head a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, whereas she wanted to govern an <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a>; these conflicting goals undermined the project and led to its failure. Britain, which had a strong influence in the politics of the Portuguese Empire, opposed the project as well: they did not want Spain split into several kingdoms, and considered Carlota Joaquina unable to prevent this.

After the British invasion of 1806, <a href="Santiago%20de%20Liniers%2C%201st%20Count%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">Santiago de Liniers</a> successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population did not allow <a href="Rafael%20de%20Sobremonte">Rafael de Sobremonte</a> to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location in the case of a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The <a href="Royal%20Audiencia%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires</a> did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King Charles IV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.

The Liniers administration was popular among criollos, but not among peninsulars such as the merchant <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20%C3%81lzaga">Martín de Álzaga</a> and the Governor of Montevideo, <a href="Francisco%20Javier%20de%20El%C3%ADo">Francisco Javier de Elío</a>. They requested the Spanish authorities appoint a new viceroy. In the wake of the outbreak of the Peninsular War, de Elío created the <a href="Junta%20of%20Montevideo">Junta of Montevideo</a>, which would scrutinise all the orders from Buenos Aires and reserve the right to ignore them, but did not openly deny the authority of the Viceroy or declare Montevideo independent.

Martín de Álzaga <a href="Mutiny%20of%20%C3%81lzaga">began a mutiny</a> to remove Liniers. On January 1, 1809, an <a href="open%20cabildo">open cabildo</a> (an extraordinary meeting of "<a href="vecino">vecino</a>s", prominent people of the city) chaired by Álzaga demanded the resignation of Liniers and the appointment of a local junta. The Spanish militia and a group of people summoned by the meeting gathered to support the rebellion. A small number of criollos, notably Mariano Moreno, supported the mutiny, but most of them did not. They felt that Álzaga wanted to remove the Viceroy to avoid his political authority while keeping the social differences between criollos and peninsulars unchanged. The riot was quickly routed when criollo militias led by Cornelio Saavedra surrounded the plaza and dispersed the insurgents. As a result of the failed mutiny, the rebel militias were disarmed. This included all peninsular militias, and the power of the criollos increased as a result. The leaders of the plot, with the exception of Moreno, were exiled to <a href="Carmen%20de%20Patagones">Carmen de Patagones</a>. Javier de Elío freed them and gave them political asylum at Montevideo.

The Supreme Central Junta replaced Liniers with the naval officer <a href="Baltasar%20Hidalgo%20de%20Cisneros">Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros</a>, a veteran of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, to end the political turmoil in the Río de la Plata. He arrived in Montevideo in June 1809 for the handover. Manuel Belgrano proposed that Liniers should resist on the grounds that he had been confirmed as Viceroy by a King of Spain, whereas Cisneros lacked such legitimacy. The criollo militias shared Belgrano's proposal, but Liniers handed over the government to Cisneros without resistance. Javier de Elío accepted the authority of the new Viceroy, and dissolved the Junta of Montevideo. Cisneros rearmed the disbanded peninsular militias, and pardoned those responsible for the mutiny. Álzaga was not freed, but his sentence was commuted to house arrest.

There was concern about events in Spain and about the legitimacy of local governors in <a href="Upper%20Peru">Upper Peru</a> as well. On May 25, 1809, the <a href="Chuquisaca%20Revolution">Chuquisaca Revolution</a> deposed <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Garc%C3%ADa%20de%20Le%C3%B3n%20y%20Pizarro">Ramón García de León y Pizarro</a> as Governor of <a href="Sucre">Chuquisaca</a> and replaced him with <a href="Juan%20Antonio%20Alvarez%20de%20Arenales">Juan Antonio Alvarez de Arenales</a>. On July 16, the <a href="La%20Paz%20revolution">La Paz revolution</a>, led by Colonel <a href="Pedro%20Domingo%20Murillo">Pedro Domingo Murillo</a>, deposed the Governor of La Paz and elected a new <a href="Junta%20Tuitiva%20de%20los%20Derechos%20del%20Pueblo">junta</a>. A swift reaction from the Spanish authorities defeated those rebellions. An army of 1,000 men sent from Buenos Aires found no resistance at Chuquisaca, took control of the city and overthrew the Junta. Murillo tried to defend La Paz, but his 800 militiamen were completely outnumbered by the more than 5,000 soldiers sent from Lima. He and the other leaders were later beheaded, and their heads were exhibited as a deterrent. These measures contrasted sharply with the pardon that Martín de Álzaga and others had received after a short time in prison, and the resentment of criollos against the peninsulars deepened. Juan José Castelli was present at the deliberations of the University of Chuquisaca, where <a href="Bernardo%20Monteagudo">Bernardo Monteagudo</a> developed the "Syllogism of Chuquisaca", a legal explanation to justify <a href="self-governance">self-governance</a>. This influenced his ideas during the "May Week".

On November 25, 1809, Cisneros created the Political Surveillance Court to persecute "<a href="afrancesado">afrancesado</a>s" (supporters of Joseph Bonaparte) and <a href="Independence">independentists</a>. However, he rejected economist José María Romero's proposal to banish a number of people considered dangerous to the Spanish regime, such as Saavedra, Paso, Vieytes, Castelli and Moreno, among others. Romero warned Cisneros against spreading news that might be considered subversive. Criollos felt that soon any pretext would be enough to lead to the outbreak of revolution. In April 1810, Cornelio Saavedra advised to his friends: "it's not time yet, let the figs ripen and then we'll eat them". He meant that he would not support rushed actions against the Viceroy, but would do so at a strategically favorable moment, such as when Napoleon's forces gained a decisive advantage in their war against Spain.

The May Week was the period of time in Buenos Aires which began with the confirmation of the fall of the Supreme Central Junta and ended with the dismissal of Cisneros and the establishment of the <a href="Primera%20Junta">Primera Junta</a>.

On May 14, 1810, the British war schooner HMS "Mistletoe" arrived at Buenos Aires with European newspapers that reported the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta the previous January. The city of Seville had been <a href="Siege%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">invaded</a> by French armies, which were already dominating most of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>. The newspapers reported that some of the former members of the Junta had taken refuge on the <a href="Isla%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Isla de León</a> in Cadiz. This was confirmed in Buenos Aires on May 17, when the British frigate HMS "John Paris" arrived in Montevideo; the most recent newspapers reported that members of the Supreme Central Junta had been dismissed. The Council of Regency of Cadiz was not seen as a successor of the Spanish resistance but as an attempt to restore absolutism in Spain. The Supreme Central Junta was seen as sympathetic to the new ideas. South American patriots feared both a complete French victory in the peninsula and an absolutist restoration. Cisneros monitored the British warships and seized their newspapers, to conceal the news, but a newspaper came into the hands of Belgrano and Castelli. They spread the news among other patriots and challenged the legitimacy of the Viceroy, who had been appointed by the fallen junta. When Cornelio Saavedra, head of the <a href="regiment%20of%20Patricians">regiment of Patricians</a>, was informed of this news, he decided that it was finally the ideal time to take action against Cisneros. <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28politician%29">Martín Rodríguez</a> proposed to overthrow the Viceroy by force, but Castelli and Saavedra rejected this idea and proposed the convening of an open cabildo.

Although Viceroy Cisneros attempted to conceal the news of the Spanish defeat, the rumor had already spread throughout Buenos Aires. Most of the population was uneasy; there was high activity at the barracks and in the Plaza, and most shops were closed. The "Café de Catalanes" and the "Fonda de las Naciones", frequent criollo meeting places, became venues for political discussions and radical proclamations; <a href="Francisco%20Jos%C3%A9%20Planes">Francisco José Planes</a> shouted that Cisneros should be hanged in the Plaza as retribution for the execution of the leaders of the ill-fated La Paz revolution. People who sympathized with the absolutist government were harassed, but the fights were of little consequence because nobody was allowed to take muskets or swords out of the barracks.

The Viceroy, trying to calm the criollos, gave his own version of events in a proclamation. He asked for allegiance to King Ferdinand VII, but popular unrest continued to intensify. He was aware of the news, but only said that the situation on the Iberian Peninsula was delicate; he did not confirm the fall of the Junta. His proposal was to make a government body that would rule on behalf of Ferdinand VII, together with <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20Peru">Viceroy of Peru</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Fernando%20de%20Abascal%20y%20Sousa">José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa</a>, Governor of Potosí <a href="Francisco%20de%20Paula%20Sanz">Francisco de Paula Sanz</a> and President of the Royal Audiencia of Charcas <a href="Vicente%20Nieto">Vicente Nieto</a>.

Not fooled by the Viceroy's communiqué, some criollos met at the houses of <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Pe%C3%B1a">Nicolás Rodríguez Peña</a> and Martín Rodríguez. During these secret meetings, they appointed a representative commission composed of Juan José Castelli and Martín Rodríguez to request that Cisneros convene an open cabildo to decide the future of the Viceroyalty.

During the night of May 19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which involved military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Lezica">Juan José de Lezica</a>, the senior <a href="alcalde">alcalde</a> (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator <a href="Juli%C3%A1n%20de%20Leiva">Julián de Leiva</a>, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said that if it was not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.

Lezica informed Cisneros of the request for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders to come to the fort at 7 pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded on behalf of all the criollo regiments. He compared the current international situation with that prevailing at the time of the mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. He rejected the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out that the Supreme Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy no longer existed, so he rejected Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.

Castelli and Martín Rodríguez moved to the Fort for an interview with Cisneros. <a href="Juan%20Florencio%20Terrada">Juan Florencio Terrada</a>, commander of the Infantry Grenadiers, joined them, because their barracks were located under Cisneros' window, and his presence would not allow the Viceroy to request military aid to take Castelli and Martín Rodríguez prisoners. The guards let them pass unannounced, and they found Cisneros playing cards with Brigadier Quintana, prosecutor Caspe and aide Coicolea. Castelli and Rodríguez demanded once again the convening of an open cabildo, and Cisneros reacted angrily, considering their request an outrage. Rodríguez interrupted him and forced him to give a definitive answer. After a short private discussion with Caspe, Cisneros reluctantly gave his consent.

That night, many of the revolutionaries attended a theatre production on the theme of tyranny, called "Rome Saved". The lead actor was Morante, playing <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with "Misanthropy and Repentance" by the German novelist and playwright <a href="August%20von%20Kotzebue">August von Kotzebue</a>. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the <a href="Gauls">Gauls</a> are ancestors of the <a href="French%20people">French people</a>) and the need for strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.

After the play, the revolutionaries returned to Peña's house. They learned the result of the meeting with Cisneros, but were unsure as to whether Cisneros intended to keep his word. They organized a demonstration for the following day to ensure that the open cabildo would be held as decided.

At 3 pm, the Cabildo began its routine work, but was interrupted by 600 armed men named the Infernal Legion, who occupied the Plaza de la Victoria and loudly demanded the convening of an open cabildo and the resignation of Viceroy Cisneros. They carried a portrait of Ferdinand VII and the lapels of their jackets bore a white ribbon that symbolized criollo–Spanish unity. <a href="Domingo%20French">Domingo French</a>, the mail carrier of the city, and Antonio Beruti, an employee of the treasury, led the rioters. It was rumored that Cisneros had been killed, and that Saavedra would take control of the government. Saavedra was at the barracks at that moment, concerned about the demonstration. He thought the violence should be stopped and that radical measures such as the assassination of Cisneros should be prevented, but he also thought that the troops would mutiny if the demonstrations were suppressed. The people in the Plaza did not believe that Cisneros would allow the open cabildo the next day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was representing the crowd, requested a definitive commitment. Leiva explained that everything would go ahead as planned, but the Cabildo needed time to prepare. He asked Belgrano to help the Cabildo with the work, as his intervention would be seen by the crowd as a guarantee that their demands would not be ignored. The crowd left the main hall but stayed in the Plaza. Belgrano protested about the guest list, which consisted of the wealthiest citizens, and thought that if the poor people were left outside there would be further unrest. The members of the Cabildo tried to convince him to give his support, but he left.

Belgrano's departure enraged the crowd, as he did not explain what had happened, and the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened to say that the claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.

The invitations were distributed among 450 leading citizens and officials in the capital. The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting people that would be likely to support the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so that most people would be against Cisneros instead. The printer <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Jos%C3%A9%20Donado">Agustín Donado</a>, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600 invitations instead of the 450 requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.

According to the minutes, only about 251 out of the 450 officially invited guests attended the open cabildo. French and Beruti, in command of 600 men armed with knives, shotguns and rifles, controlled access to the square to ensure that the open cabildo had a majority of criollos. All noteworthy religious and civilian people were present, as well as militia commanders and many prominent residents. The only notable absence was that of Martín de Álzaga, who was still under house arrest.

A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, attended the open cabildo but, in a letter to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.

The meeting lasted from morning to midnight, including the reading of the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of <a href="retroversion%20of%20the%20sovereignty%20to%20the%20people">retroversion of the sovereignty to the people</a> stated that, in the absence of the legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish <a href="scholasticism">scholasticism</a> and <a href="Rationalism">rationalist philosophy</a>, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a <a href="Junta%20%28Peninsular%20War%29">junta, like the ones established in Spain</a> to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.

One of the speakers for the first position was the bishop of Buenos Aires, <a href="Benito%20Lue%20y%20Riega">Benito Lue y Riega</a>, leader of the local church, who said:

Not only is there no reason to get rid of the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain remained unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there. If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.

<a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Castelli">Juan José Castelli</a> was the main speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was dissolved and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until Ferdinand VII could return to the throne.

Nobody could call the whole nation a criminal, nor the individuals that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, it would be fair for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.

<a href="Pascual%20Ruiz%20Huidobro">Pascual Ruiz Huidobro</a> stated that, since the authority that appointed Cisneros had expired, Cisneros should no longer have a place in the government. Huidobro felt that the Cabildo should be in government, as it was the representative of the people. Melchor Fernández, Juan León Ferragut and Joaquín Grigera supported his vote, among others.
Attorney <a href="Manuel%20Genaro%20Villota">Manuel Genaro Villota</a>, representative of the conservative Spanish, said that the city of Buenos Aires had no right to make unilateral decisions about the legitimacy of the Viceroy or the Council of Regency without the participation of other cities of the Viceroyalty. He argued that such an action would break the unity of the country and establish as many sovereignties as there were cities. His intention was to keep Cisneros in power by delaying any possible action. Juan José Paso accepted his first point, but argued that the situation in Europe and the possibility that Napoleon's forces could conquer the American colonies demanded an urgent resolution. He then expounded the "argument of the elder sister", reasoning that Buenos Aires should take the initiative and make the changes deemed necessary and appropriate, on the express condition that the other cities would be invited to comment as soon as possible. The rhetorical device of the "elder sister", comparable to "<a href="negotiorum%20gestio">negotiorum gestio</a>", makes an analogy between the relationship of Buenos Aires and other cities of the viceroyalty with a sibling relationship.

The priest <a href="Juan%20Nepomuceno%20Sol%C3%A1">Juan Nepomuceno Solá</a> then proposed that the Cabildo should receive the provisional command, until the formation of a governing junta made up of representatives from all populations of the Viceroyalty. Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga (who would be members of the Primera Junta some days later), Escalada and Argerich (or Aguirre) supported his vote, among others.

Cornelio Saavedra suggested that the Cabildo should receive the provisional command until the formation of a governing junta in the manner and form that the Cabildo would deem as appropriate. He said "...there shall be no doubt that it is the people that create authority or command." At the time of the vote, Castelli's position coincided with that of Saavedra.

Manuel Belgrano stood near a window and, in the event of a problematic development, he would give a signal by waiving a white cloth, upon which the people gathered in the Plaza would force their way into the Cabildo. However, there were no problems and this emergency plan was not implemented. The historian <a href="Vicente%20Fidel%20L%C3%B3pez">Vicente Fidel López</a> revealed that his father, <a href="Vicente%20L%C3%B3pez%20y%20Planes">Vicente López y Planes</a>, who was present at the event, saw that Mariano Moreno was worried near the end in spite of the majority achieved. Moreno told Planes that the Cabildo was about to betray them.

The debate took all day, and the votes were counted very late that night. After the presentations, people voted for the continuation of the Viceroy, alone or at the head of a junta, or his dismissal. The ideas explained were divided into a small number of proposals, designated with the names of their main supporters, and the people then voted for one of those proposals. The voting lasted for a long time, and the result was to dismiss the Viceroy by a large majority: 155 votes to 69.

Manuel José Reyes stated that he found no reason to depose the Viceroy, and that it would be enough to appoint a junta headed by Cisneros. His proposal had nearly 30 votes. Another 30 votes supported Cisneros, with no change to the political system. A small group supported the proposal of Martín José de Choteco, who also supported Cisneros.

There were also many different proposals involving the removal of Cisneros. Many of them required the new authorities to be elected by the Cabildo. Pascual Ruiz Huidobro proposed that the Cabildo should rule in the interim and appoint a new government, but this proposal made no reference to <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a> or the creation of a junta. This proposal received 35 votes, and sought simply to replace Cisneros with Huidobro: Huidobro was the most senior military officer, and thus the natural candidate under current laws to replace the viceroy in the lack of a new appointment from Spain. Juan Nepomuceno Solá proposed a junta composed of delegates from all the provinces of the viceroyalty, while the Cabildo should govern in the interim; this proposal received nearly 20 votes. Cornelio Saavedra, whose aforementioned proposal was that the Cabildo should appoint a Junta and rule in the interim, got the largest number of votes. A number of other proposals received only a few votes each.

At dawn on May 23, the Cabildo informed the population that the Viceroy would end his mandate. The highest authority would be transferred temporarily to the Cabildo until the appointment of a governing junta. Notices were placed at various points throughout the city, which announced the imminent creation of a junta and the summoning of representatives from the provinces. The notices also called for the public to refrain from actions contrary to public policy.

The Cabildo interpreted the decision of the open cabildo in its own way. When it formed the new Junta to govern until the arrival of representatives from other cities, Leiva arranged for former viceroy Cisneros to be appointed president of the Junta and commander of the armed forces. There are <a href="Historiography%20of%20the%20May%20Revolution%23Factual%20concerns">many interpretations</a> of his motives for departing from the decision of the open cabildo in this way. Four other members were appointed to the Junta: criollos Cornelio Saavedra and Juan José Castelli, and peninsulars Juan Nepomuceno Solá and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Santos%20Inchaurregui">José Santos Inchaurregui</a>.

Leiva wrote a constitutional code to regulate the actions of the Junta. It stipulated that the Junta could not exercise judicial power, which was reserved for the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires; that Cisneros could not act without the support of the other members of the Junta; that the Cabildo could dismiss anyone who neglected his duty; that the Cabildo's consent would be required to create new taxes; that the Junta would sanction a general amnesty for those who had aired opinions at the open cabildo; and that the Junta would invite the other cities to send delegates. The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, agreed to this code. The Junta swore the oath of office that afternoon.

These developments shocked the revolutionaries. Unsure of what to do next, they feared that they would be punished, like the revolutionaries of Chuquisaca and La Paz. Moreno abjured relations with the others and shut himself in his home. There was a meeting at Rodríguez Peña's house. They felt that the Cabildo would not pursue such a plot without the blessing of Saavedra and that Castelli should resign from the Junta. Tagle took a different view: he thought that Saavedra may have accepted out of weakness or naivety and that Castelli should stay in the Junta to counter the others' influence on him. Meanwhile, a mob led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti filled the Plaza. The stability of Cisneros in power, albeit in an office other than Viceroy, was seen as an insult to the will of the open cabildo. Colonel Martín Rodriguez warned that, if the army were to commit support to a government that kept Cisneros, they would soon have to fire on the people, and that they would revolt. He said that "everyone without exception" demanded the removal of Cisneros.

That night, Castelli and Saavedra informed Cisneros of their resignation from the newly formed Junta. They explained that the population was on the verge of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did not have the power to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted to wait for the following day, but they said that there was no time for further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.

On the morning of May 25, in spite of bad weather, a crowd gathered in the Plaza de la Victoria, as did the militia led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti. They demanded the recall of the Junta elected the previous day, the final resignation of Cisneros, and the appointment of a new junta that did not include him. Historian <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Mitre">Bartolomé Mitre</a> stated that French and Beruti distributed blue and white ribbons, similar to the modern <a href="cockade%20of%20Argentina">cockade of Argentina</a>, among those present. Later historians doubt it, but consider it possible that the revolutionaries used distinctive marks of some kind for identification. It was rumored that the Cabildo might reject Cisneros' resignation. Because of delays in issuing an official resolution, the crowd became agitated, clamoring that "<a href="%C2%A1El%20pueblo%20quiere%20saber%20de%20qu%C3%A9%20se%20trata%21">the people want to know what is going on!</a>".

The Cabildo met at 9 am and rejected Cisneros' resignation. They considered that the crowd had no legitimate right to influence something that the Cabildo had already decided and implemented. They considered that, as the Junta was in command, the demonstration should be suppressed by force, and made the members responsible for any changes to the resolution of the previous day. To enforce those orders, they summoned the chief commanders, but these did not obey. Many of them, including Saavedra, did not appear. Those that did stated that they could not support the government order, and that the commanders would be disobeyed if they ordered the troops to repress the demonstrators.

The crowd's agitation increased, and they overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested that someone who could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires had no right to break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out that the only way to calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400 people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.
After a long interval, a document containing 411 signatures was delivered to the Cabildo. This paper proposed a new composition for the governing Junta, and a 500-man expedition to assist the provinces. The document—still preserved—listed most army commanders and many well-known residents, and contained many illegible signatures. French and Beruti signed the document, stating "for me and for six hundred more". However, there is no unanimous view among historians about the <a href="Historiography%20of%20the%20May%20Revolution%23Factual%20concerns">authorship of the document</a>. Meanwhile, the weather improved and the sun broke through the clouds. The people in the plaza saw it as a favorable omen for the revolution. The "<a href="Sun%20of%20May">Sun of May</a>" was created a few years later with reference to this event.

The Cabildo accepted the document and moved to the balcony to submit it directly to the people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, the number of people in the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore the patience of the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.

The Primera Junta was finally established. It was composed by president Cornelio Saavedra, members <a href="Manuel%20Alberti">Manuel Alberti</a>, <a href="Miguel%20de%20Azcu%C3%A9naga">Miguel de Azcuénaga</a>, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, <a href="Domingo%20Matheu">Domingo Matheu</a> and <a href="Juan%20Larrea%20%28politician%29">Juan Larrea</a>, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were roughly the same as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina">Córdoba, Argentina</a>, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.

Buenos Aires endured the whole Spanish American Wars of independence without being reconquered by royalist armies or successful royalist counter-revolutions. However, it faced several internal conflicts. The May Revolution lacked a clear <a href="Libertadores">leader</a> as other regions of Latin America; the secretary Mariano Moreno led the initial phase of the government, but he was removed shortly afterwards.

The Council of Regency, the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires and the peninsulars opposed the new situation. The Royal Audiencia secretly swore allegiance to the Council of Regency a month later and sent communiqués to the other cities of the Viceroyalty, to request them to deny recognition to the new government. To put an end to these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and all the members of the Royal Audiencia on the pretext that their lives were in danger, and sent them into exile aboard the British ship "Dart". Captain Mark Brigut Larrea was instructed to avoid American ports and deliver all of them directly to the Canary Islands. The Junta then appointed a new Audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to the revolution.

Every city in the territory of modern Argentina other than Córdoba endorsed the Primera Junta. The cities of the Upper Peru, however, did not take a position, owing to the recent outcomes of the Chuquisaca and La Paz Revolutions. <a href="Asunci%C3%B3n%20del%20Paraguay">Asunción del Paraguay</a> rejected the Junta and swore loyalty to the Council of Regency. The <a href="Banda%20Oriental">Banda Oriental</a>, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.

Former Viceroy <a href="Santiago%20de%20Liniers%2C%201st%20Count%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">Santiago de Liniers</a> <a href="Liniers%20Counter-revolution">organized a counter-revolution</a> in Córdoba, and this became the first military campaign of the independent government. Despite the importance of Liniers himself, and his prestige as a popular hero for his role when the British invaded, the population of Córdoba preferred to support the revolution. This reduced the power of the counter-revolutionary army by means of desertions and sabotage. Liniers's troops were quickly defeated by the forces led by <a href="Francisco%20Ortiz%20de%20Ocampo">Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo</a>. Ocampo refused to shoot the captive Liniers; hence the execution ordered by the Junta was carried out by Juan José Castelli. After the victory, the Primera Junta sent military expeditions to many other cities, to demand support and the election of representatives to it.
Montevideo, which had a historical rivalry with Buenos Aires, opposed the Primera Junta and the Council of Regency declared it the new capital of the Viceroyalty, along with Francisco Javier de Elío as the new Viceroy. The city was well defended, so it could easily resist an invasion. Peripheral cities in the Banda Oriental acted contrary to Montevideo's will and supported the Buenos Aires Junta. <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Gervasio%20Artigas">José Gervasio Artigas</a> led them, and kept Montevideo under siege. The final defeat of the Montevidean royalists was carried out by <a href="Carlos%20Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Alvear">Carlos María de Alvear</a> and <a href="William%20Brown%20%28admiral%29">William Brown</a>.

The <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Chile">Captaincy General of Chile</a> followed a process analogous to that of the May Revolution, and elected a <a href="Government%20Junta%20of%20Chile%20%281810%29">Government Junta</a> that inaugurated the brief period known as "<a href="Patria%20Vieja">Patria Vieja</a>". The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rancagua">Battle of Rancagua</a>, and the subsequent <a href="Reconquista%20%28Chile%29">Reconquista</a> of Chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, so there was no military confrontation between them until the <a href="Crossing%20of%20the%20Andes">Crossing of the Andes</a>, led by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20San%20Mart%C3%ADn">José de San Martín</a> in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.

The Primera Junta increased in size when it incorporated the representatives sent by the provinces. From then on, the Junta was renamed the "<a href="Junta%20Grande">Junta Grande</a>". It was dissolved shortly after the June 1811 defeat of the Argentine troops at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Huaqui">Battle of Huaqui</a>, and two successive triumvirates exercised executive power over the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of the Río de la Plata</a>. In 1814, the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate%20%28Argentina%29">second triumvirate</a> was replaced by the authority of the <a href="Supreme%20Director%20of%20the%20United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Supreme Director</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Miguel%20de%20G%C3%BCemes">Martín Miguel de Güemes</a> contained the royalist armies sent from the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20Peru">Viceroyalty of Peru</a> at <a href="Salta">Salta</a>, while San Martín advanced towards the royalist stronghold of Lima by sea, on a Chilean–Argentine campaign. The war for independence gradually shifted towards northern South America. From 1814, Argentina <a href="Argentine%20Civil%20Wars">descended into civil war</a>.

According to historian <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Luna">Félix Luna</a>'s "<a href="Breve%20historia%20de%20los%20Argentinos">Breve historia de los Argentinos</a>" (), one of the most important societal consequences of the May Revolution was the shift in the way the people and its rulers related. Until then, the conception of the common good prevailed: while royal authority was fully respected, if an instruction from the crown of Spain was considered detrimental to the common good of the local population, it was half-met or simply ignored. With the revolution, the concept of common good gave way to that of popular sovereignty, as theorized by Moreno, Castelli and Monteagudo, among others. This idea held that, in the absence of a legitimate authority, the people had the right to appoint their own leaders. Over time, popular sovereignty would give way to the idea of <a href="majority%20rule">majority rule</a>. This maturation of ideas was gradual, taking many decades to crystallize into stable electoral and political systems, but it was what ultimately led to the adoption of the <a href="republic">republican system</a> as the form of government for Argentina. <a href="Domingo%20Faustino%20Sarmiento">Domingo Faustino Sarmiento</a> stated similar views in his "<a href="Facundo">Facundo</a>", and noted that cities were more receptive to republican ideas, while rural areas were more resistant to them, which led to the surge of <a href="caudillo">caudillo</a>s.

Another consequence, also according to Luna, was the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">dissolution of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a> into several different units. Most of the cities and provinces had distinctive populations, economies, attitudes, contexts, and interests. Until the revolution, all of these peoples were held together by the authority of the Spanish government, but with its disappearance, people from Montevideo, Paraguay and the Upper Peru began to distance themselves from Buenos Aires. The brief existence of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, which had lasted barely 38 years, impeded the consolidation of a patriotic feeling and failed to bring a sense of community to all of the population. The new country of Argentina lacked an established concept of national identity capable to unite the population under a common idea of statehood. <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20Alberdi">Juan Bautista Alberdi</a> sees the May Revolution as one of the early manifestations of the power struggles between the city of Buenos Aires and the provinces—one of the axial conflicts at play in the <a href="Argentine%20civil%20wars">Argentine civil wars</a>. Alberdi wrote in his book ""Escritos póstumos"":

The revolution of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, intended to win the independence of Argentina from Spain, also had the consequence of emancipating the province of Buenos Aires from Argentina or, rather, of imposing the authority of this province upon the whole nation emancipated from Spain. That day, Spanish power over the Argentine provinces ended and that of Buenos Aires was established.

<a href="Historiography">Historiographical</a> studies of the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the information was properly recorded at the time and was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.
The first people to write about the May Revolution were participants who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, <a href="Manuel%20Moreno">Manuel Moreno</a> wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.

The first remarkable historiographical school of interpretation of the <a href="history%20of%20Argentina">history of Argentina</a> was founded by members of the <a href="1837%20generation">1837 generation</a>, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the <a href="charismatic%20authority">charismatic authority</a> of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical until the end of the 19th century, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ about the relative weight of the <a href="causes%20of%20the%20May%20Revolution">causes of the May Revolution</a> and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; <a href="Ricardo%20Levene">Ricardo Levene</a> and the "<a href="National%20Academy%20of%20History%20of%20Argentina">Academia Nacional de la Historia</a>" were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a <a href="historical%20revisionism">revisionist</a> view based on nationalism and <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.

The May Revolution was not the product of the actions of a single political party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, there are a number of conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to "<a href="The%20Representation%20of%20the%20Landowners">The Representation of the Landowners</a>" (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> and <a href="economic%20integration">economic integration</a> with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a <a href="Political%20radicalism">radical</a> revolution.

The government created on May 25 pronounced itself loyal to the deposed King of Spain Ferdinand VII, but historians disagree on whether this was sincere or not. Since Mitre, many historians think that this professed loyalty was merely a political deception to gain autonomy. The Primera Junta did not pledge allegiance to the Council of Regency, which was still in operation, and in 1810 it still seemed unlikely that Napoleon would be defeated and Ferdinand returned to the throne (which finally happened on December 11, 1813, with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Valen%C3%A7ay">Treaty of Valençay</a>). The purpose of such a deception would have been to gain time to strengthen the position of the patriotic cause and avoid reactions that may have led to a counter-revolution, by making it appear that monarchical authority was still respected and that no revolution had taken place. The ruse is known as the "Mask of Ferdinand VII". It was upheld by the Primera Junta, the Junta Grande and the First Triumvirate. The <a href="Asamblea%20del%20A%C3%B1o%20XIII">Assembly of Year XIII</a> was intended to declare independence, but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members. However, it suppressed mention of Ferdinand VII in official documents. Before the <a href="Argentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declaration of independence of 1816</a>, the supreme directors considered other options, such as to negotiate with Spain or become a British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>.

The change was potentially favorable for Britain, as trade with the cities of the area was facilitated, without the monopoly that Spain had maintained over their colonies for centuries. However, Britain's first priority was the war against France in Europe, and they could not appear to support American independence movements or allow the military attention of Spain to be divided onto two different fronts. Consequently, they pushed to avoid explicit independence demonstrations. This pressure was exerted by <a href="Lord%20Strangford">Lord Strangford</a>, the British ambassador at the court of Rio de Janeiro; he expressed support for the Junta, but under the condition that "...the behavior is consistent, and that [the] Capital [is] retained on behalf of Mr. Dn. Ferdinand VII and his legitimate successors". Later conflicts between Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Artigas led to internal conflicts on the British front, between Strangford and the Portuguese regent <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">John VI of Portugal</a>.

Juan Bautista Alberdi and later historians such as <a href="Norberto%20Galasso">Norberto Galasso</a>, <a href="Luis%20Romero%20%28historian%29">Luis Romero</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Chiaramonte">José Carlos Chiaramonte</a> doubted Mitre's interpretation and put forward different ones. Alberdi thought that "the Argentine revolution is a chapter of the Hispanoamerican revolution, as also of the Spanish one, as also of the French and European one". They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between new libertarian ideas and absolutism. The intention was not to cut ties with Spain, but to reformulate the relationship; similarly, the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> was not separatist at its initial steps either. Thus, it would have the characteristics of a civil war instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu, and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of José de San Martín: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Martín had spent most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Martín talked about enemies, he called them "<a href="Royalist%20%28Spanish%20American%20Revolution%29">royalists</a>" or "Goths", but never "Spanish".

According to those historians, the Spanish revolution against absolutism got mixed up with the Peninsular War. When Ferdinand VII stood against his father Charles IV, who was seen as an absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of Ferdinand VII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (<a href="Libert%C3%A9%2C%20%C3%A9galit%C3%A9%2C%20fraternit%C3%A9">liberty, equality and fraternity</a>) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, as he began the <a href="Absolutist%20Restoration">Absolutist Restoration</a> and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay as a part of the Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.

May 25 is a <a href="national%20day">national day</a> in Argentina, known as "<a href="First%20Patriotic%20Government">First Patriotic Government</a>", with the character of a public holiday. The public holiday is set by law 21.329 and is always celebrated on May 25, regardless of the day of the week. The <a href="Argentina%20Centennial">Argentina Centennial</a> and the <a href="Argentina%20Bicentennial">Argentina Bicentennial</a> were celebrated in 1910 and 2010.

May 25 was designated as a patriotic date in 1813, but the Argentine Declaration of Independence suggests July 9 as an alternative national day. At first this added to the conflicts between Buenos Aires and the provinces during the <a href="Argentine%20Civil%20War">Argentine Civil War</a>, because the date in May related to Buenos Aires and the date of July 9 related to the whole country. Thus the <a href="Unitarian%20Party">unitarian</a> <a href="Bernardino%20Rivadavia">Bernardino Rivadavia</a> canceled the celebration of July 9, and the <a href="Federalist%20Party%20%28Argentina%29">federalist</a> <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20de%20Rosas">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a> allowed it again, but maintained the May celebrations. By 1880, the <a href="federalization%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">federalization of Buenos Aires</a> removed the local connotations and the May Revolution was considered the birth of the nation.

The date, as well as a generic image of the <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Cabildo">Buenos Aires Cabildo</a>, are used in different variants to honor the May Revolution. Two of the most notable are the "<a href="Avenida%20de%20Mayo">Avenida de Mayo</a>" and the "<a href="Plaza%20de%20Mayo">Plaza de Mayo</a>" in Buenos Aires, near the location of the Cabildo. The "<a href="Pir%C3%A1mide%20de%20Mayo">May Pyramid</a>" was erected in the Plaza a year after the revolution, and was rebuilt in its present form in 1856. "Veinticinco de Mayo" ("May 25") is the name of several administrative divisions, cities, public spaces and landforms of Argentina. There are departments of this name in the provinces of Chaco, Misiones, San Juan, Rio Negro and Buenos Aires, the latter holding the town of <a href="Veinticinco%20de%20Mayo%2C%20Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Veinticinco de Mayo</a>. The cities of Rosario (Santa Fe), Junín (Buenos Aires) and Resistencia (Chaco) have eponymous squares. <a href="King%20George%20Island%20%28Antarctica%29">King George Island</a>, which is claimed by Argentina, Britain and Chile, as part of the <a href="Argentine%20Antarctica">Argentine Antarctica</a>, the <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Territory">British Antarctic Territory</a> and the <a href="Chilean%20Antarctic%20Territory">Chilean Antarctic Territory</a> respectively, is referred to as "Isla 25 de Mayo" in Argentina.

A representation of a cabildo is used on Argentine 25-cent coins, and an image of the Sun of May appears on the 5-cent coin. An image of the Cabildo during the Revolution appeared on the back of the 5-peso banknote of the former <a href="Argentine%20peso%20moneda%20nacional">peso moneda nacional</a>.

Unification of Germany

The unification of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a> officially occurred on 18 January 1871, in the <a href="Hall%20of%20Mirrors">Hall of Mirrors</a> at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a> in France. Princes of the German states, excluding Austria, gathered there to proclaim <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">William I</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> as <a href="German%20Empire">German Emperor</a> after the French capitulation in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. Unofficially, the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers, but in fits and starts. The self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, which prompted the dissolution of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in 1806, and the subsequent rise of <a href="German%20nationalism">German nationalism</a>.

Unification exposed tensions due to religious, linguistic, social, and cultural differences among the inhabitants of the new nation, suggesting that 1871 only represented one moment in a continuum of the larger unification processes. The Holy Roman Emperor had been often called "Emperor of all the Germanies"; contemporary news accounts frequently referred to "The Germanies". In the empire, higher nobility were referred to as "Princes of Germany" or "Princes of the Germanies"—for the lands once called <a href="East%20Francia">East Francia</a> had been organized and governed as pocket kingdoms since before the rise of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> (800 AD). In the mountainous terrain of much of the territory, isolated peoples developed cultural, educational, linguistic, and religious differences over such a lengthy time period. By the nineteenth century, transportation and communications improvements brought these regions closer together.

The Holy Roman Empire, which had included more than 500 independent states, was effectively dissolved when Emperor Francis II abdicated (6 August 1806) during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>. Despite the legal, administrative, and political disruption associated with the end of the Empire, the people of the German-speaking areas of the old Empire had a common linguistic, cultural, and legal tradition further enhanced by their shared experience in the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. <a href="European%20liberalism">European liberalism</a> offered an intellectual basis for unification by challenging <a href="dynastic">dynastic</a> and <a href="Absolutism%20%28European%20history%29">absolutist</a> models of social and political organization; its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition, education, and linguistic unity of peoples in a geographic region. Economically, the creation of the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n (customs union) in 1818, and its subsequent expansion to include other states of the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a>, reduced competition between and within states. Emerging modes of transportation facilitated business and recreational travel, leading to contact and sometimes conflict among German speakers from throughout Central Europe.

The model of diplomatic <a href="spheres%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a> resulting from the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> dominance in Central Europe. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the <a href="German%20people">German</a> states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This <a href="German%20dualism">German dualism</a> presented two solutions to the problem of unification: , the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or , the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).

Historians debate whether <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>—<a href="Minister%20President%20of%20Prussia">Minister President of Prussia</a>—had a master plan to expand the <a href="North%20German%20Confederation">North German Confederation</a> of 1866 to include the remaining independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand the <a href="power%20in%20international%20relations">power</a> of <a href="Prussia">the Kingdom of Prussia</a>. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck's led a collection of early modern <a href="polities">polities</a> to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a> provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of Liberation</a> of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.


Prior to 1803, German-speaking Central Europe included more than 300 political entities, most of which were part of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> or the extensive <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> hereditary dominions. They ranged in size from the small and complex territories of the princely <a href="Hohenlohe">Hohenlohe</a> family branches to sizable, well-defined territories such as the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>. Their governance varied: they included <a href="free%20imperial%20city">free imperial cities</a>, also of different sizes, such as the powerful <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> and the minuscule <a href="Weil%20der%20Stadt">Weil der Stadt</a>; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy <a href="Abbey%20of%20Reichenau">Abbey of Reichenau</a> and the powerful <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Cologne">Archbishopric of Cologne</a>; and dynastic states such as <a href="Duchy%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>. These lands (or parts of them—both the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> domains and <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> Prussia also included territories outside the Empire structures) made up the territory of the Holy Roman Empire, which at times included <a href="List%20of%20states%20in%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire">more than 1,000 entities</a>. Since the 15th century, with few exceptions, the Empire's <a href="Prince-elector">Prince-elector</a>s had chosen successive heads of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a> to hold the title of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of <a href="imperial%20circles">imperial circles</a> ("Reichskreise"), groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection.

The <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a> (1799–1802) resulted in the defeat of the imperial and allied forces by <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. The treaties of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lun%C3%A9ville">Lunéville</a> (1801) and the <a href="German%20Mediatization">Mediatization of 1803</a> secularized the ecclesiastical principalities and abolished most free imperial cities and these territories along with their inhabitants were absorbed by dynastic states. This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Baden">Baden</a>. In 1806, after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia and Russia at the joint battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Jena-Auerstedt">Jena-Auerstedt</a>, Napoleon dictated the <a href="Peace%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29">Treaty of Pressburg</a> and presided over the creation of the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine">Confederation of the Rhine</a>, which, "inter alia", provided for the mediatization of over a hundred petty princes and counts and the absorption of their territories, as well as those of hundreds of <a href="Imperial%20Knight">imperial knights</a>, by the Confederation's member-states. Following the formal secession of these member-states from the Empire, the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire.

Under the <a href="French%20period">hegemony</a> of the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a> (1804–1814), popular German nationalism thrived in the reorganized German states. Due in part to the shared experience, albeit under French dominance, various justifications emerged to identify "Germany" as a single state. For the German philosopher <a href="Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a>,
The first, original, and truly natural boundaries of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.

A common language may have been seen to serve as the basis of a nation, but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">Napoleon's campaigns in Poland</a> (1806–07), the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Iberian Peninsula</a>, western Germany, and his disastrous <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">invasion of Russia</a> in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a> nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the <a href="L%C3%BCtzow%20Free%20Corps">Lützow Free Corps</a> exemplified this tendency.

The debacle in Russia loosened the French grip on the German princes. In 1813, Napoleon mounted a campaign in the German states to bring them back into the French orbit; the subsequent <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of Liberation</a> culminated in the great <a href="Battle%20of%20Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a>, also known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nations">Battle of Nations</a>. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the <a href="Sixth%20Coalition">Coalition</a> of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on <a href="Elba">Elba</a>. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the <a href="Hundred%20Days">100 Days</a> of 1815, forces of the <a href="Seventh%20Coalition">Seventh Coalition</a>, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> and a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n army under the command of <a href="Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Gebhard von Blücher</a>, were victorious at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at <a href="Battle%20of%20Ligny">Ligny</a> the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key building block of the <a href="Borussian%20myth">"Borussian" myth</a> expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.

After Napoleon's defeat, the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> established a new European political-diplomatic system based on the <a href="Balance%20of%20power%20in%20international%20relations">balance of power</a>. This system reorganized Europe into <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a>, which, in some cases, suppressed the aspirations of the various nationalities, including the Germans and Italians. Generally, an enlarged Prussia and the 38 other states consolidated from the mediatized territories of 1803 were confederated within the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>'s sphere of influence. The Congress established a loose <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> (1815–1866), headed by Austria, with a "Federal <a href="diet%20%28assembly%29">Diet</a>" (called the "Bundestag" or "<a href="Bundesversammlung%20%28German%20Confederation%29">Bundesversammlung</a>", an assembly of appointed leaders) that met in the city of <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a>. In recognition of the imperial position traditionally held by the Habsburgs, the emperors of Austria became the titular presidents of this parliament. Problematically, the built-in Austrian dominance failed to take into account Prussia's 18th century emergence in Imperial politics. Ever since the <a href="Prince-Elector">Prince-Elector</a> of <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> had made himself <a href="King%20in%20Prussia">King in Prussia</a> at the beginning of that century, their domains had steadily increased through war and inheritance. Prussia's consolidated strength had become especially apparent during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a> and the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> under <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>. As <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a> and <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph</a> tried to restore Habsburg hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick countered with the creation of the "<a href="F%C3%BCrstenbund">Fürstenbund</a>" (Union of Princes) in 1785. Austrian-Prussian <a href="German%20dualism">dualism</a> lay firmly rooted in old Imperial politics. Those balance of power manoeuvers were epitomized by the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of the Bavarian Succession</a>, or "<a href="Potato%20War%23Change%20in%20warfare">Potato War</a>" among common folk. Even after the end of the Holy Roman Empire, this competition influenced the growth and development of nationalist movements in the 19th century.

Despite the nomenclature of "Diet" (Assembly or Parliament), this institution should in no way be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Baden">Duchy of Baden</a>, based <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to a small portion of the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 <a href="Battle%20of%20Jena-Auerstedt">Battle of Jena-Auerstedt</a>, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.

The surge of German <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, stimulated by the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect its roots in the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The "<a href="Burschenschaft">Burschenschaft</a>" student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at <a href="Wartburg">Wartburg</a> Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the <a href="German%20Campaign%20of%201813">German Campaign of 1813</a> engendered an expectation of <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a> and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as <a href="Klemens%20Wenzel%2C%20Prince%20von%20Metternich">Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich</a>, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist <a href="August%20von%20Kotzebue">August von Kotzebue</a> in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the <a href="Carlsbad%20Decrees">Carlsbad Decrees</a>, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.

Metternich was able to harness conservative outrage at the assassination to consolidate legislation that would further limit the press and constrain the rising liberal and nationalist movements. Consequently, these decrees drove the "Burschenschaften" underground, restricted the publication of nationalist materials, expanded censorship of the press and private correspondence, and limited academic speech by prohibiting university professors from encouraging nationalist discussion. The decrees were the subject of <a href="Johann%20Joseph%20von%20G%C3%B6rres">Johann Joseph von Görres</a>'s pamphlet "Teutschland [archaic: Deutschland] und die Revolution" ("Germany and the Revolution") (1820), in which he concluded that it was both impossible and undesirable to repress the free utterance of public opinion by reactionary measures.

Another institution key to unifying the German states, the "<a href="Zollverein">Zollverein</a>", helped to create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister <a href="Hans%2C%20Count%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans, Count von Bülow</a>, as a Prussian <a href="customs%20union">customs union</a> in 1818, the "Zollverein" linked the many Prussian and <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers between the German states, especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods, making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy, transport, and sell raw materials. This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers, most of which were located in the Prussian regions of the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, the <a href="Saar%20River">Saar</a>, and the <a href="Ruhr%20%28river%29">Ruhr</a> valleys. States more distant from the coast joined the Customs Union earlier. Not being a member mattered more for the states of south Germany, since the external tariff of the Customs Union prevented customs-free access to the coast (which gave access to international markets). Thus, by 1836, all states to the south of Prussia had joined the Customs Union, except Austria.

In contrast, the coastal states already had barrier free access to international trade and did not want consumers and producers burdened with the import duties they would pay if they were within the Zollverein customs border. Hanover on the north coast formed its own customs union - the “Tax Union” or <a href="Steuerverein">Steuerverein</a> - in 1834 with Brunswick and with Oldenburg in 1836. The external tariffs on finished goods and overseas raw materials were below the rates of the Zollverein. Brunswick joined the Zollverein Customs Union in 1842, while Hanover and Oldenburg finally joined in 1854 After the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg were annexed by Prussia and thus annexed also to the Customs Union, while the two Mecklenburg states and the city states of Hamburg and Bremen joined late because they were reliant on international trade. The Mecklenburgs joined in 1867, while Bremen and <a href="Accession%20of%20Hamburg%20to%20the%20German%20Customs%20Union%20%28Zollverein%29">Hamburg joined in 1888</a>.

By the early 19th century, German roads had deteriorated to an appalling extent. Travelers, both foreign and local, complained bitterly about the state of the "Heerstraßen", the military roads previously maintained for the ease of moving troops. As German states ceased to be a military crossroads, however, the roads improved; the length of hard–surfaced roads in Prussia increased from in 1816 to in 1852, helped in part by the invention of <a href="macadam">macadam</a>. By 1835, <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Gagern">Heinrich von Gagern</a> wrote that roads were the "veins and arteries of the body politic..." and predicted that they would promote freedom, independence and prosperity. As people moved around, they came into contact with others, on trains, at hotels, in restaurants, and for some, at fashionable resorts such as the spa in <a href="Kurhaus%20%28Baden-Baden%29">Baden-Baden</a>. Water transportation also improved. The blockades on the Rhine had been removed by Napoleon's orders, but by the 1820s, steam engines freed riverboats from the cumbersome system of men and animals that towed them upstream. By 1846, 180 steamers plied German rivers and <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a>, and a network of canals extended from the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, the <a href="Weser">Weser</a>, and the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> rivers.

As important as these improvements were, they could not compete with the impact of the railway. German economist <a href="Friedrich%20List">Friedrich List</a> called the railways and the Customs Union "Siamese Twins", emphasizing their important relationship to one another. He was not alone: the poet <a href="August%20Heinrich%20Hoffmann%20von%20Fallersleben">August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben</a> wrote a poem in which he extolled the virtues of the "Zollverein", which he began with a list of commodities that had contributed more to German unity than politics or diplomacy. Historians of the <a href="Second%20Reich">Second Empire</a> later regarded the railways as the first indicator of a unified state; the patriotic novelist, <a href="Wilhelm%20Raabe">Wilhelm Raabe</a>, wrote: "The German empire was founded with the construction of the first railway..." Not everyone greeted the "iron monster" with enthusiasm. The Prussian king <a href="Frederick%20William%20III">Frederick William III</a> saw no advantage in traveling from Berlin to <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> a few hours faster, and Metternich refused to ride in one at all. Others wondered if the railways were an "evil" that threatened the landscape: <a href="Nikolaus%20Lenau">Nikolaus Lenau</a>'s 1838 poem "An den Frühling" ("To Spring") bemoaned the way trains destroyed the pristine quietude of German forests.

The <a href="Bavarian%20Ludwig%20Railway">Bavarian Ludwig Railway</a>, which was the first passenger or freight rail line in the German lands, connected <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> and <a href="F%C3%BCrth">Fürth</a> in 1835. Although it was long and only operated in daylight, it proved both profitable and popular. Within three years, of track had been laid, by 1840, , and by 1860, . Lacking a geographically central organizing feature (such as a national capital), the rails were laid in webs, linking towns and markets within regions, regions within larger regions, and so on. As the rail network expanded, it became cheaper to transport goods: in 1840, 18 "<a href="Pfennig">Pfennig</a>s" per ton per kilometer and in 1870, five "Pfennigs". The effects of the railway were immediate. For example, raw materials could travel up and down the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a> Valley without having to unload and reload. Railway lines encouraged economic activity by creating demand for commodities and by facilitating commerce. In 1850, inland shipping carried three times more freight than railroads; by 1870, the situation was reversed, and railroads carried four times more. Rail travel changed how cities looked and how people traveled. Its impact reached throughout the social order, affecting the highest born to the lowest. Although some of the outlying German provinces were not serviced by rail until the 1890s, the majority of the population, manufacturing centers, and production centers were linked to the rail network by 1865.

As travel became easier, faster, and less expensive, Germans started to see unity in factors "other" than their language. The <a href="Brothers%20Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a>, who compiled a massive dictionary known as "The Grimm", also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. <a href="Karl%20Baedeker">Karl Baedeker</a> wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, sites to visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.

The words of <a href="August%20Heinrich%20Hoffmann%20von%20Fallersleben">August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben</a> expressed not only the linguistic unity of the German people but also their geographic unity. In "Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles", officially called "<a href="Das%20Lied%20der%20Deutschen">Das Lied der Deutschen</a>" (""The Song of the Germans""), Fallersleben called upon sovereigns throughout the German states to recognize the unifying characteristics of the German people. Such other patriotic songs as "<a href="Die%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Die Wacht am Rhein</a>" ("The Watch on the Rhine") by <a href="Max%20Schneckenburger">Max Schneckenburger</a> began to focus attention on geographic space, not limiting "Germanness" to a common language. Schneckenburger wrote "The Watch on the Rhine" in a specific patriotic response to French assertions that the Rhine was France's "natural" eastern boundary. In the refrain, "Dear fatherland, dear fatherland, put your mind to rest / The watch stands true on the Rhine", and in such other patriotic poetry as Nicholaus Becker's "Das Rheinlied" ("The Rhine"), Germans were called upon to defend their territorial homeland. In 1807, <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> argued that national character reflected geographic influence, linking landscape to people. Concurrent with this idea, movements to preserve old fortresses and historic sites emerged, and these particularly focused on the Rhineland, the site of so many confrontations with France and Spain.

The period of Austrian and Prussian police-states and vast censorship before the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20Germany">Revolutions of 1848 in Germany</a> later became widely known as the "<a href="Vorm%C3%A4rz">Vormärz</a>", the "before March", referring to March 1848. During this period, European liberalism gained momentum; the agenda included economic, social, and political issues. Most European liberals in the "Vormärz" sought unification under nationalist principles, promoted the transition to capitalism, sought the expansion of male suffrage, among other issues. Their "radicalness" depended upon where they stood on the spectrum of <a href="Universal%20suffrage">male suffrage</a>: the wider the definition of suffrage, the more radical.

Despite considerable conservative reaction, ideas of unity joined with notions of popular sovereignty in German-speaking lands. The <a href="Hambach%20Festival">Hambach Festival</a> ("Hambacher Fest") in May 1832 was attended by a crowd of more than 30,000. Promoted as a <a href="county%20fair">county fair</a>, its participants celebrated fraternity, liberty, and national unity. Celebrants gathered in the town below and marched to the ruins of <a href="Hambach%20Castle">Hambach Castle</a> on the heights above the small town of Hambach, in the Palatinate province of Bavaria. Carrying flags, beating drums, and singing, the participants took the better part of the morning and mid-day to arrive at the castle grounds, where they listened to speeches by nationalist orators from across the conservative to radical political spectrum. The overall content of the speeches suggested a fundamental difference between the German nationalism of the 1830s and the French nationalism of the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a>: the focus of German nationalism lay in the education of the people; once the populace was educated as to what was needed, they would accomplish it. The Hambach rhetoric emphasized the overall peaceable nature of German nationalism: the point was not to build barricades, a very "French" form of nationalism, but to build emotional bridges between groups.

As he had done in 1819, after the <a href="August%20von%20Kotzebue">Kotzebue</a> assassination, Metternich used the popular demonstration at Hambach to push conservative social policy. The "Six Articles" of 28 June 1832 primarily reaffirmed the principle of monarchical authority. On 5 July, the Frankfurt Diet voted for an additional 10 articles, which reiterated existing rules on censorship, restricted political organizations, and limited other public activity. Furthermore, the member states agreed to send military assistance to any government threatened by unrest. <a href="Karl%20Philipp%20von%20Wrede">Prince Wrede</a> led half of the Bavarian army to the Palatinate to "subdue" the province. Several hapless Hambach speakers were arrested, tried and imprisoned; one, Karl Heinrich Brüggemann (1810–1887), a law student and representative of the secretive "Burschenschaft", was sent to Prussia, where he was first condemned to death, but later pardoned.

Several other factors complicated the rise of <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a> in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, and again in the 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged as a result of a shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.

The economic, social and cultural dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure of most of the governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the <a href="Phytophthora%20infestans">potato blight</a> (related to the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Irish Famine</a>) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.

Crucially, both the Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any clear-cut program of unification. At Hambach, the positions of the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the "Volk" (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.

The widespread—mainly German—<a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20Germany">revolutions of 1848–49</a> sought unification of Germany under a single constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, for a parliamentary assembly that would have the responsibility to draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal male suffrage</a>, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the <a href="Prussian%20three-class%20franchise">Prussian three-class franchise</a>, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.

On 27 March 1849, the <a href="Frankfurt%20Parliament">Frankfurt Parliament</a> passed the "<a href="Paulskirchenverfassung">Paulskirchenverfassung</a>" (Constitution of St. Paul's Church) and offered the title of "Kaiser" (Emperor) to the Prussian king <a href="Frederick%20William%20IV">Frederick William IV</a> the next month. He refused for a variety of reasons. Publicly, he replied that he could not accept a crown without the consent of the actual states, by which he meant the princes. Privately, he feared opposition from the other German princes and military intervention from Austria or Russia. He also held a fundamental distaste for the idea of accepting a crown from a popularly elected parliament: he would not accept a crown of "clay". Despite franchise requirements that often perpetuated many of the problems of sovereignty and political participation liberals sought to overcome, the Frankfurt Parliament did manage to draft a constitution and reach an agreement on the "kleindeutsch" solution. While the liberals failed to achieve the unification they sought, they did manage to gain a partial victory by working with the German princes on many constitutional issues and collaborating with them on reforms.

Scholars of German history have engaged in decades of debate over how the successes and failures of the Frankfurt Parliament contribute to the historiographical explanations of German nation building. One school of thought, which emerged after <a href="World%20War%20I">The Great War</a> and gained momentum in the aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, maintains that the failure of German liberals in the Frankfurt Parliament led to <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> compromise with conservatives (especially the conservative <a href="Junker">Junker</a> landholders), which subsequently led to the so-called "<a href="Sonderweg">Sonderweg</a>" (distinctive path) of 20th-century German history. Failure to achieve unification in 1848, this argument holds, resulted in the late formation of the nation-state in 1871, which in turn delayed the development of positive national values. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> often called on the German public to sacrifice all for the cause of their great nation, but his regime did not create German nationalism: it merely capitalized on an intrinsic cultural value of German society that still remains prevalent even to this day. Furthermore, this argument maintains, the "failure" of 1848 reaffirmed latent aristocratic longings among the German middle class; consequently, this group never developed a self-conscious program of modernization.

More recent scholarship has rejected this idea, claiming that Germany did not have an actual "distinctive path" any more than any other nation, a historiographic idea known as <a href="exceptionalism">exceptionalism</a>. Instead, modern historians claim 1848 saw specific achievements by the liberal politicians. Many of their ideas and programs were later incorporated into Bismarck's social programs (e.g., social insurance, education programs, and wider definitions of suffrage). In addition, the notion of a distinctive path relies upon the underlying assumption that some other nation's path (in this case, the United Kingdom's) is the accepted norm. This new argument further challenges the norms of the British-centric model of development: studies of national development in Britain and other "normal" states (e.g., France or the United States) have suggested that even in these cases, the modern nation-state did not develop evenly. Nor did it develop particularly early, being rather a largely mid-to-late-19th-century phenomenon. Since the end of the 1990s, this view has become widely accepted, although some historians still find the "Sonderweg" analysis helpful in understanding the period of <a href="National%20Socialism">National Socialism</a>.

After the Frankfurt Parliament disbanded, Frederick William IV, under the influence of General <a href="Joseph%20von%20Radowitz">Joseph Maria von Radowitz</a>, supported the establishment of the <a href="Erfurt%20Union">Erfurt Union</a>—a federation of German states, excluding Austria—by the free agreement of the German princes. This limited union under Prussia would have almost entirely eliminated Austrian influence on the other German states. Combined diplomatic pressure from Austria and Russia (a guarantor of the 1815 agreements that established European spheres of influence) forced Prussia to relinquish the idea of the Erfurt Union at a meeting in the small town of <a href="Olomouc">Olmütz</a> in Moravia. In November 1850, the Prussians—specifically Radowitz and Frederick William—agreed to the restoration of the German Confederation under Austrian leadership. This became known as the <a href="Punctation%20of%20Olm%C3%BCtz">Punctation of Olmütz</a>, but among Prussians it was known as the "Humiliation of Olmütz."

Although seemingly minor events, the Erfurt Union proposal and the Punctation of Olmütz brought the problems of influence in the German states into sharp focus. The question became not a matter of "if" but rather "when" unification would occur, and "when" was contingent upon strength. One of the former Frankfurt Parliament members, <a href="Johann%20Gustav%20Droysen">Johann Gustav Droysen</a>, summed up the problem:
We cannot conceal the fact that the whole <a href="German%20question">German question</a> is a simple alternative between Prussia and Austria. In these states, German life has its positive and negative poles—in the former, all the interests [that] are national and reformative, in the latter, all that are dynastic and destructive. The German question is not a constitutional question but a question of power; and the Prussian monarchy is now wholly German, while that of Austria cannot be.
Unification under these conditions raised a basic diplomatic problem. The possibility of German (or <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian</a>) unification would overturn the overlapping <a href="Sphere%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a> system created in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna. The principal architects of this convention, <a href="Klemens%20Wenzel%2C%20Prince%20von%20Metternich">Metternich</a>, <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Viscount%20Castlereagh">Castlereagh</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Alexander</a> (with his foreign secretary Count <a href="Karl%20Nesselrode">Karl Nesselrode</a>), had conceived of and organized a Europe balanced and guaranteed by four "<a href="great%20powers">great powers</a>": Great Britain, France, Russia, and Austria, with each power having a geographic sphere of influence. France's sphere included the Iberian Peninsula and a share of influence in the Italian states. Russia's included the eastern regions of Central Europe and a balancing influence in the Balkans. Austria's sphere expanded throughout much of the Central European territories formerly held by the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. Britain's sphere was the rest of the world, especially the seas.

This sphere of influence system depended upon the fragmentation of the German and Italian states, not their consolidation. Consequently, a German nation united under one banner presented significant questions. There was no readily applicable definition for who the German people would be or how far the borders of a German nation would stretch. There was also uncertainty as to who would best lead and defend "Germany", however it was defined. Different groups offered different solutions to this problem. In the "<a href="Kleindeutschland">Kleindeutschland</a>" ("Lesser Germany") solution, the German states would be united under the leadership of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">Prussian Hohenzollerns</a>; in the "<a href="Kleindeutschland%20and%20Gro%C3%9Fdeutschland">Grossdeutschland</a>" ("Greater Germany") solution, the German states would be united under the leadership of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrian Habsburgs</a>. This controversy, the latest phase of the <a href="German%20dualism">German dualism</a> debate that had dominated the politics of the German states and Austro-Prussian diplomacy since the 1701 creation of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, would come to a head during the following twenty years.

Other nationalists had high hopes for the German unification movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> wrote to German revolutionary <a href="Karl%20Blind">Karl Blind</a> on 10 April 1865, "The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [that] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." Garibaldi looked to Germany for the "kind of leadership [that], in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression."

German unification had also been viewed as a prerequisite for the creation of a European federation, which <a href="Giuseppe%20Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a> and other European patriots had been promoting for more than three decades:
In the spring of 1834, while at <a href="Berne">Berne</a>, Mazzini and a dozen refugees from Italy, Poland and Germany founded a new association with the grandiose name of <a href="Young%20Europe">Young Europe</a>. Its basic, and equally grandiose idea, was that, as the French Revolution of 1789 had enlarged the concept of individual liberty, another revolution would now be needed for national liberty; and his vision went further because he hoped that in the no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal Europe with some kind of federal assembly to regulate their common interests. [...] His intention was nothing less than to overturn the European settlement agreed [to] in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked the emergence of smaller nations. [...] Mazzini hoped, but without much confidence, that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime. In practice Young Europe lacked the money and popular support for more than a short-term existence. Nevertheless he always remained faithful to the ideal of a united continent for which the creation of individual nations would be an indispensable preliminary.

King <a href="Frederick%20William%20IV">Frederick William IV</a> suffered a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother <a href="Wilhelm%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">William</a> becoming <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a> of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Moltke%20the%20Elder">Helmuth von Moltke</a> had become chief of the <a href="Prussian%20General%20Staff">Prussian General Staff</a> in 1857, and <a href="Albrecht%20von%20Roon">Albrecht von Roon</a> would become <a href="Prussian%20Minister%20of%20War">Prussian Minister of War</a> in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially how to pay for them) caused a <a href="constitutional%20crisis">constitutional crisis</a> beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> to the position of <a href="Minister-President%20of%20Prussia">Minister-President of Prussia</a> in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.

The <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> of 1854–55 and the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Italian War of 1859</a> disrupted relations among Great Britain, France, Austria, and Russia. In the aftermath of this disarray, the convergence of von Moltke's operational redesign, von Roon and Wilhelm's army restructure, and Bismarck's diplomacy influenced the realignment of the European balance of power. Their combined agendas established Prussia as the leading German power through a combination of foreign diplomatic triumphs—backed up by the possible use of Prussian military might—and an internal conservativism tempered by pragmatism, which came to be known as "<a href="Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>".

Bismarck expressed the essence of "Realpolitik" in his subsequently famous <a href="Blood%20and%20Iron%20%28speech%29">"Blood and Iron" speech</a> to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 30 September 1862, shortly after he became Minister President: "The great questions of the time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions—that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood." Bismarck's words, "iron and blood" (or "blood and iron", as often attributed), have often been misappropriated as evidence of a German lust for blood and power. First, the phrase from his speech "the great questions of time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions" is often interpreted as a repudiation of the political process—a repudiation Bismarck did not himself advocate. Second, his emphasis on blood and iron did not imply simply the unrivaled military might of the Prussian army but rather two important aspects: the ability of the assorted German states to produce iron and other related war materials and the willingness to use those war materials if necessary.

By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, the idea of a German nation-state in the peaceful spirit of <a href="Pan-Germanism">Pan-Germanism</a> had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck's more conservative "Realpolitik". Bismarck sought to link a unified state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck's primary contributions to the creation of the <a href="Second%20Reich">German Empire</a> in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of this. To get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck's role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck's intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a grand scheme to unify a nation-state. Regardless of motivation, by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, Bismarck demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.

Three episodes proved fundamental to the unification of Germany. First, the death <a href="Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark%23Succession%20crisis">without male heirs</a> of <a href="Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick VII of Denmark</a> led to the <a href="Second%20War%20of%20Schleswig">Second War of Schleswig</a> in 1864. Second, the <a href="Italian%20unification">unification of Italy</a> provided Prussia an ally against Austria in the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> of 1866. Finally, France—fearing Hohenzollern encirclement—declared war on Prussia in 1870, resulting in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. Through a combination of Bismarck's diplomacy and political leadership, <a href="Albrecht%20von%20Roon">von Roon</a>'s military reorganization, and <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Moltke%20the%20Elder">von Moltke</a>'s military strategy, Prussia demonstrated that none of the European signatories of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">1815 peace treaty</a> could guarantee Austria's sphere of influence in Central Europe, thus achieving Prussian hegemony in Germany and ending the dualism debate.

The first episode in the saga of German unification under Bismarck came with the <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Question">Schleswig-Holstein Question</a>. On 15 November 1863, King <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Christian IX of Denmark</a> became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig and Holstein. On 18 November 1863, he signed the <a href="History%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein%23The%20November%20Constitution">Danish November Constitution</a> and declared the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Schleswig">Duchy of Schleswig</a> a part of Denmark. The <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> saw this act as a violation of the <a href="London%20Protocol%20%281852%29">London Protocol</a> of 1852, which emphasized the status of the Kingdom of Denmark as distinct from the independent duchies of Schleswig and <a href="Holstein">Holstein</a>. The populations of Schleswig and Holstein, furthermore, valued their separate status. The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of these duchies as a rallying cry: large portions of both Schleswig and Holstein were of German origin and spoke German in everyday life (though Schleswig had a sizable Danish minority). Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed, and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the border into Schleswig on 1 February 1864. Initially, the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the "<a href="Danevirke">Danevirke</a>", but this proved futile. The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces, and they could not rely on help from their allies in the other Scandinavian states because Denmark had nullified its alliance by violating the London Protocol. The <a href="Needle%20Gun">Needle Gun</a>, one of the first <a href="bolt%20action%20rifle">bolt action rifle</a>s to be used in conflict, aided the Prussians in both this war and the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> two years later. The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone, while its muzzle-loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing. The <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a> resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria, and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding <a href="Treaty%20of%20Vienna%20%281864%29">peace of Vienna</a>, signed on 30 October 1864.

The second episode in Bismarck's unification efforts occurred in 1866. In concert with <a href="Italian%20unification">the newly formed Italy</a>, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist the other in a war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian "Landtag" (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.

The debate over the proposed national constitution became moot when news of Italian troop movements in <a href="History%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial <a href="mobilization">mobilization</a> in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave <a href="Helmuth%20Graf%20von%20Moltke">von Moltke</a> command over the Prussian armed forces, and the next day he began full-scale mobilization.

In the Diet, the group of middle-sized states, known as "Mittelstaaten" (<a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>, the grand duchies of <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Baden">Baden</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Hesse">Hesse</a>, and the duchies of <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Saxony–Weimar</a>, <a href="Saxe-Meiningen">Saxony–Meiningen</a>, <a href="Saxe-Coburg">Saxony–Coburg</a>, and <a href="Nassau%2C%20Germany">Nassau</a>), supported complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck used to try to gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian <a href="war%20cabinet">war cabinet</a> understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Mecklenburg-Schwerin">Mecklenburg-Schwerin</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.

Opposition to Prussia's strong-armed tactics surfaced in other social and political groups. Throughout the German states, city councils, liberal parliamentary members who favored a unified state, and chambers of commerce—which would see great benefits from unification—opposed any war between Prussia and Austria. They believed any such conflict would only serve the interests of royal dynasties. Their own interests, which they understood as "civil" or "bourgeois", seemed irrelevant. Public opinion also opposed Prussian domination. Catholic populations along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>—especially in such cosmopolitan regions as <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> and in the heavily populated <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a> Valley—continued to support Austria. By late spring, most important states opposed Berlin's effort to reorganize the German states by force. The Prussian cabinet saw German unity as an issue of power and a question of who had the strength and will to wield that power. Meanwhile, the liberals in the Frankfurt assembly saw German unity as a process of negotiation that would lead to the distribution of power among the many parties.

Although several German states initially sided with Austria, they stayed on the defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the <a href="Needle%20gun%23Dreyse%20needle%20gun">technologically superior</a> Prussian army with support only from <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the <a href="Third%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Third Italian War of Independence</a> on a second front in <a href="Venetia%20%28region%29">Venetia</a> and on the Adriatic sea.

In the day-long <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz">Battle of Königgrätz</a>, near the village of <a href="Sadov%C3%A1">Sadová</a>, the Crown Prince <a href="Prince%20Frederick%20Charles%20of%20Prussia">Friedrich Carl</a> and his troops arrived late, and in the wrong place. Once he arrived, however, he ordered his troops immediately into the fray. The battle was a decisive victory for Prussia and forced the Habsburgs to end the war, laying the groundwork for the "Kleindeutschland" (little Germany) solution, or "Germany without Austria."

A quick peace was essential to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Hanover</a>, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hesse">Hesse-Kassel</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Nassau">Nassau</a>, and the <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Frankfurt">city of Frankfurt</a>. <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Hesse">Hesse Darmstadt</a> lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the <a href="North%20German%20Confederation">North German Confederation</a>.

The end of Austrian dominance of the German states shifted Austria's attention to the Balkans. In 1867, the Austrian emperor <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph</a> accepted a settlement (the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Compromise%20of%201867">Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</a>) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains, creating the Dual Monarchy of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. The <a href="Peace%20of%20Prague%20%281866%29">Peace of Prague (1866)</a> offered lenient terms to Austria, in which Austria's relationship with the new nation-state of Italy underwent major restructuring; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops, the monarchy lost the important province of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia">Venetia</a>. The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France, which then formally transferred control to Italy. The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded "Revanche pour Sadová" ("Revenge for Sadova"), illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France—a problem that would accelerate in the months leading up to the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. The Austro-Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government. At a meeting in <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a> in September 1865 with <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, Bismarck had let it be understood (or Napoleon had thought he understood) that France might annex parts of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> in exchange for its neutrality in the war. These annexations did not happen, resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck.

The reality of defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of internal divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation had its own constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance to the idea of a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.

By 1870 three of the important lessons of the Austro-Prussian war had become apparent. The first lesson was that, through force of arms, a powerful state could challenge the old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815. Second, through diplomatic maneuvering, a skillful leader could create an environment in which a rival state would declare war first, thus forcing states allied with the "victim" of external aggression to come to the leader's aid. Finally, as Prussian military capacity far exceeded that of Austria, Prussia was clearly the only state within the Confederation (or among the German states generally) capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression. In 1866, most mid-sized German states had opposed Prussia, but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with Prussia. In the event that a European state declared war on one of their members, they all would come to the defense of the attacked state. With skillful manipulation of European politics, Bismarck created a situation in which France would play the role of aggressor in German affairs, while Prussia would play that of the protector of German rights and liberties.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Metternich and his conservative allies had reestablished the Spanish monarchy under <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">King Ferdinand VII</a>. Over the following forty years, the great powers supported the Spanish monarchy, but events in 1868 would further test the old system. A revolution in Spain overthrew <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Queen Isabella II</a>, and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris. The Spanish, looking for a suitable Catholic successor, had offered the post to three European princes, each of whom was rejected by <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, who served as regional power-broker. Finally, in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenzollern">Leopold</a> of <a href="Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen">Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen</a>, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line. The ensuing furor has been dubbed by historians as the <a href="Hohenzollern%20candidature">Hohenzollern candidature</a>.

Over the next few weeks, the Spanish offer turned into the talk of Europe. Bismarck encouraged Leopold to accept the offer. A successful installment of a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen king in Spain would mean that two countries on either side of France would both have German kings of Hohenzollern descent. This may have been a pleasing prospect for Bismarck, but it was unacceptable to either Napoleon III or to <a href="Agenor%2C%20duc%20de%20Gramont">Agenor, duc de Gramont</a>, his minister of foreign affairs. Gramont wrote a sharply formulated ultimatum to Wilhelm, as head of the Hohenzollern family, stating that if any Hohenzollern prince should accept the crown of Spain, the French government would respond—although he left ambiguous the nature of such response. The prince withdrew as a candidate, thus defusing the crisis, but the French ambassador to Berlin would not let the issue lie. He approached the Prussian king directly while Wilhelm was vacationing in <a href="Bad%20Ems">Ems Spa</a>, demanding that the King release a statement saying he would never support the installation of a Hohenzollern on the throne of Spain. Wilhelm refused to give such an encompassing statement, and he sent Bismarck a dispatch by telegram describing the French demands. Bismarck used the king's telegram, called the <a href="Ems%20Dispatch">Ems Dispatch</a>, as a template for a short statement to the press. With its wording shortened and sharpened by Bismarck—and further alterations made in the course of its translation by the French agency <a href="Havas">Havas</a>—the Ems Dispatch raised an angry furor in France. The French public, still aggravated over the defeat at Sadová, demanded war.

Napoleon III had tried to secure territorial concessions from both sides before and after the Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with nothing. He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by <a href="Albrecht%20von%20Roon">von Roon</a> and the operational strategy of <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Moltke%20the%20Elder">Moltke</a> combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably <a href="Battle%20of%20Spicheren">Spicheren</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%B6rth%20%281870%29">Wörth</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mars-la-Tour">Mars la Tour</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Gravelotte">Gravelotte</a>, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of <a href="Metz">Metz</a> and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan">Sedan</a> on 1 September 1870.

The humiliating capture of the French emperor and the loss of the French army itself, which marched into captivity at a makeshift camp in the Saarland ("Camp Misery"), threw the French government into turmoil; Napoleon's energetic opponents overthrew his government and proclaimed the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">Third Republic</a>. The German High Command expected an overture of peace from the French, but the new republic refused to surrender. The Prussian army <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">invested</a> Paris and <a href="Siege%20of%20Paris%20%281870-1871%29">held it under siege until mid-January</a>, with the city being "ineffectually bombarded". On 18 January 1871, the German princes and senior military commanders <a href="William%20I%20of%20Germany%23Emperor">proclaimed Wilhelm "German Emperor"</a> in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Under the subsequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Frankfurt%20%281871%29">Treaty of Frankfurt</a>, France relinquished most of its traditionally German regions (<a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> and the German-speaking part of <a href="Lorraine%20%28province%29">Lorraine</a>); paid an indemnity, calculated (on the basis of population) as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon Bonaparte imposed on Prussia in 1807; and accepted German administration of Paris and most of northern France, with "German troops to be withdrawn stage by stage with each installment of the indemnity payment".

Victory in the Franco-Prussian War proved the capstone of the nationalist issue. In the first half of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states (aside from Austria) to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as "Kaiser", Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles%20of%201871">Treaty of Versailles of 1871</a> (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Frankfurt%20%281871%29">Treaty of Frankfurt</a> of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the "Zollverein." The difficulties of the "Vormärz", the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.

The new German Empire included 25 states, three of them <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic</a> cities. It realized the "<a href="Kleindeutsche%20L%C3%B6sung">Kleindeutsche Lösung</a>" ("Lesser German Solution", with the exclusion of Austria) as opposed to a "<a href="German%20question">Großdeutsche Lösung</a>" or "Greater German Solution", which would have included Austria. Unifying various states into one nation required more than some military victories, however much these might have boosted morale. It also required a rethinking of political, social, and cultural behaviors and the construction of new metaphors about "us" and "them". Who were the new members of this new nation? What did they stand for? How were they to be organized?

Though often characterized as a federation of monarchs, the German Empire, strictly speaking, federated a group of 26 states.

The 1866 <a href="North%20German%20Constitution">North German Constitution</a> became (with some semantic adjustments) the 1871 <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20German%20Empire">Constitution of the German Empire</a>. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: notably the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Imperial Diet</a>, which—in contrast to the parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation on the basis of elections by direct and equal <a href="Universal%20suffrage">suffrage</a> of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the "Bundesrat", the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as "Kaiser", who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the <a href="State%20Secretary">State Secretaries</a> (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.

The "Sonderweg" hypothesis attributed Germany's difficult 20th century to the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian <a href="landed%20elite">landed elite</a>s, the "<a href="Prussian%20Junkers">Junkers</a>", retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The "Sonderweg" hypothesis attributed their power to the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the "Junkers" as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic cities</a> and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.

Additional studies of different groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all contributed to a new view of the period. Although the "Junkers" did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters as much as the "Sonderweg" theorists had hypothesized. Eastern "Junker" power had a counterweight in the western provinces in the form of the Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.

If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had lacked a constitution and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, and enthusiastic crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, and the provision of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did not make a <a href="nation">nation</a>.

A key element of the <a href="nation-state">nation-state</a> is the creation of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a "<a href="Kulturkampf">Kulturkampf</a>" (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of <a href="Germanization">Germanization</a> of non-German people of the empire's population, including the <a href="Poles">Polish</a> and <a href="Danish%20people">Danish</a> minorities, started with language, in particular, the <a href="German%20language">German language</a>, compulsory schooling (<a href="Germanization">Germanization</a>), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.

For some Germans, the definition of "nation" did not include pluralism, and <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Catholics</a> in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%23Chancellor%20of%20the%20German%20Empire%20%281871%E2%80%931918%29">chancellor</a>, Bismarck tried without much success to limit the influence of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and of its party-political arm, the <a href="Catholic%20Centre%20Party">Catholic Center Party</a>, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, under the control of the state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The <a href="Kulturkampf%23Congregations%20Law%201875">Congregations Law</a> of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.

The <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Germanized Jews</a> remained another vulnerable population in the new German nation-state. Since 1780, after emancipation by the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a>, Jews in the former Habsburg territories had enjoyed considerable economic and legal privileges that their counterparts in other German-speaking territories did not: they could own land, for example, and they did not have to live in a Jewish quarter (also called the "<a href="Ghetto">Judengasse</a>", or "Jews' alley"). They could also attend universities and enter the professions. During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, many of the previously strong barriers between Jews and Christians broke down. Napoleon had ordered the <a href="Jewish%20emancipation">emancipation of Jews</a> throughout territories under French hegemony. Like their French counterparts, wealthy German Jews sponsored <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a>; in particular, several Jewish "salonnières" held important gatherings in Frankfurt and Berlin during which German intellectuals developed their own form of republican intellectualism. Throughout the subsequent decades, beginning almost immediately after the defeat of the French, reaction against the mixing of Jews and Christians limited the intellectual impact of these salons. Beyond the salons, Jews continued a process of <a href="Germanization">Germanization</a> in which they intentionally adopted German modes of dress and speech, working to insert themselves into the emerging 19th-century German <a href="public%20sphere">public sphere</a>. The religious reform movement among German Jews reflected this effort.

By the years of unification, German Jews played an important role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.

Another important element in nation-building, the story of the heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist <a href="Friedrich%20Christoph%20Dahlmann">Friedrich Dahlmann</a> (1785–1860), his conservative student <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Treitschke">Heinrich von Treitschke</a> (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as <a href="Theodor%20Mommsen">Theodor Mommsen</a> (1817–1903) and <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Sybel">Heinrich von Sybel</a> (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.

Heinrich von Treitschke's "History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century", published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this <a href="Borussian%20myth">"Borussian" myth</a> ("Borussia" is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.

Mommsen's contributions to the "<a href="Monumenta%20Germaniae%20Historica">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</a>" laid the groundwork for additional scholarship on the study of the German nation, expanding the notion of "Germany" to mean other areas beyond Prussia. A liberal professor, historian, and theologian, and generally a titan among late 19th-century scholars, Mommsen served as a delegate to the Prussian House of Representatives from 1863–1866 and 1873–1879; he also served as a delegate to the "Reichstag" from 1881–1884, for the liberal <a href="German%20Progress%20Party">German Progress Party</a> ("Deutsche Fortschrittspartei") and later for the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Germany%29">National Liberal Party</a>. He opposed the <a href="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> programs of Bismarck's "Kulturkampf" and the vitriolic text that Treitschke often employed in the publication of his "Studien über die Judenfrage" ("Studies of the Jewish Question"), which encouraged assimilation and Germanization of Jews.

Stretford

Stretford is a town in <a href="Trafford">Trafford</a>, Greater Manchester, England, on flat ground between the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> and the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, southwest of <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a>, south of <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a> and northeast of <a href="Altrincham">Altrincham</a>. Stretford borders <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy">Chorlton-cum-Hardy</a> to the east, <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a> to the west, Salford to the north, and <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a> to the south. The <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> bisects the town.

<a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">Historically</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village, known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.

Stretford has been the home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United Football Club</a> since 1910, and of <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire County Cricket Club</a> since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire <a href="John%20Rylands">John Rylands</a>, the <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, the painter <a href="L.%20S.%20Lowry">L. S. Lowry</a>, <a href="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>, <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a> frontman <a href="Ian%20Curtis">Ian Curtis</a> and <a href="Jay%20Kay">Jay Kay</a> of <a href="Jamiroquai">Jamiroquai</a>.

The origin of the name Stretford is "street" (<a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "stræt") on a ford across the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>. The principal road through Stretford, the <a href="A56%20road">A56 Chester Road</a>, follows the line of the old <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> from <a href="Deva%20Victrix">Deva Victrix</a> (<a href="Chester">Chester</a>) to <a href="Mancunium">Mancunium</a> (<a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.
The earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000 BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> <a href="Brigantes">Brigantes</a> tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the <a href="Cornovii%20%28Midlands%29">Cornovii</a> on the southern side of the Mersey. By 1212, there were two <a href="manorialism">manors</a> in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by <a href="Hamon%20de%20Massey">Hamon de Mascy</a>, while the land in the north, closer to the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a>, was held by Henry de Trafford. In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.

The de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> in the Old Trafford district north of the town. Until then Stretford "remained in the background of daily life in England", except for a brief cameo role during the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745">Jacobite rising of 1745</a>, when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a>'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.

Until the 1820s one of Stretford's main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302 handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still in use, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms. As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford's agricultural products, in particular <a href="rhubarb">rhubarb</a>, once known locally as Stretford beef. By 1836 <a href="market%20gardening">market gardening</a> had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the "garden of Lancashire"; in 1845 more than 500 tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week. Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of <a href="black%20pudding">black pudding</a>s, leading to the village being given the nickname of Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market.

Situated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large recreation areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a>, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution. In 1857, the gardens hosted the <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition">Art Treasures Exhibition</a>, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £38,000 to house the 16,000 exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the <a href="Royal%20Jubilee%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201887">Royal Jubilee Exhibition</a> of 1887, celebrating <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than six months and was attended by more than 4.75 million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed structure</a> in 1987.

The arrival of the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.

During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of <a href="mat%C3%A9riel">matériel</a>, including the <a href="Avro%20Manchester">Avro Manchester</a> heavy bomber, and the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> engines used to power both the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> and the <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a>. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester Blitz</a> of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>'s <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29">Old Trafford football ground</a>, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.

Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed <a href="B%26amp%3BQ">B&Q</a> store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a>, <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a>, <a href="Chaka%20Khan">Chaka Khan</a>, <a href="Curved%20Air">Curved Air</a> and <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a> were amongst those who appeared. <a href="Tangerine%20Dream">Tangerine Dream</a> was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club's Old Trafford ground, next door, has provided a concert venue for bands such as <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>, <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a>, <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>, <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a>, <a href="Arctic%20Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> and <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>.

Stretford's growth was fuelled by the transport revolutions of the 18th and especially the 19th century: the Bridgewater Canal reached Stretford in 1761, and the railway in 1849. The completion of the <a href="Manchester%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a> (MSJAR) in 1849, passing through Stretford, led to the population of the town nearly doubling in a decade, from 4,998 in 1851 to 8,757 by 1861.

Because Stretford is situated on the main <a href="A56%20road">A56 road</a> between <a href="Chester">Chester</a> and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site of what used to be the Bass Drum public house, was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. Horse-drawn omnibuses replaced the stagecoach service through Stretford in 1845. The <a href="Manchester%20Carriage%20Company">Manchester Carriage Company</a>'s tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10 minutes between 8:00 am and 10:15 pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.

The MSJAR railway line through Stretford was electrified in 1931 and converted to light rail operation in 1992, when it became part of the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> tram network. The first Metrolink tram through Stretford ran on 15 June 1992.

Stretford was part of the ancient <a href="Manchester%20%28ancient%20parish%29">parish of Manchester</a>, within the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic county boundaries</a> of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. Following the <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act">Poor Law Amendment Act</a> of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the <a href="Chorlton-upon-Medlock">Chorlton</a> Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell">Barton-upon-Irwell</a> Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of <a href="Stretford%20Urban%20District">Stretford Urban District Council</a> in 1894, as a result of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201894">Local Government Act 1894</a>.

Stretford Urban District became the <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Stretford">Municipal Borough of Stretford</a> in 1933, giving it <a href="borough%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">borough status in the United Kingdom</a>. Stretford Borough Council was granted its <a href="Coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster</a>. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.

In 1974, as a result of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the <a href="Trafford">Metropolitan Borough of Trafford</a>, in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford.

The <a href="Stretford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">constituency of Stretford</a> was created in 1885, and existed until 1997, when it was replaced by the present <a href="Stretford%20and%20Urmston%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">constituency of Stretford and Urmston</a>. <a href="Kate%20Green">Kate Green</a>, a member of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, became the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 General Election</a>, with a majority of 8,935, representing 48.6% of the vote. She retained the seat at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">2017 General Election</a> with an increased majority of 19,705, which represents 66.8% of the vote. The <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> took 27.0% of the vote, <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UKIP</a> 2.2%, the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> 2.0%, the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party</a> 1.3%, and the <a href="Christian%20Party%20%28UK%29">Christian Party</a> 0.2%.

Stretford is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford; the other three are <a href="Altrincham">Altrincham</a>, <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a> and <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a>. The area historically known as Stretford, between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in the south, has since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> of <a href="Clifford%20%28ward%29">Clifford</a>, <a href="Longford%20%28ward%29">Longford</a>, <a href="Gorse%20Hill%20%28ward%29">Gorse Hill</a>, and <a href="Stretford%20%28ward%29">Stretford</a>. Each ward is represented by three local councillors, giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council. The wards elect in thirds on a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202007">four yearly cycle</a>. As of the <a href="Trafford%20Council%20election%2C%202014">2014 local elections</a>, all 12 councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party.

Stretford occupies an area of , just north of the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>, at (53.4466, −2.3086). The area is generally flat, sloping slightly southwards towards the river valley, and is approximately above sea level at its highest point. The most southerly part of Stretford lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey, and so has historically been prone to flooding. A great deal of flood mitigation work has been carried out in the Mersey Valley since the 1970s, with the stretch of the Mersey through Stretford canalised to speed up the passage of floodwater. Emergency floodbasins have also been constructed, <a href="Sale%20Water%20Park">Sale Water Park</a> being a prominent local example, lying immediately to the south of Stretford.
Stretford comprises the local areas of <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, Gorse Hill, Trafford Park and <a href="Firswood">Firswood</a>. Its climate is generally <a href="temperate">temperate</a>, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK.

Stretford's built environment developed along the A56 road in two separate sections, corresponding to the original two manors. The area in the south, near to the border with Sale, grew around the church of St Matthew – an old alternative name for the town was Stretford St. Matthew. The northern part of Stretford was centred on Old Trafford, with undeveloped countryside separating them. During the 19th century, the sections merged.

The western terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork <a href="Nico%20Ditch">Nico Ditch</a> is in Hough Moss, just to the east of Stretford; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century.

As at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 UK census</a>, the Stretford area <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> of Clifford, Gorse Hill, Longford and Stretford had a total population of 46,910 and a population density of 8,907 persons per square mile (3,439 per km²).

Stretford residents had an average age of 36 years, younger than the 39.3 Trafford average. For every 100 females, there were 97.8 males. Of all residents, 42% were single (never married): in Trafford, 33% were single. Of the 19,209 households, 33% were one-person households, 56% were married couples with dependent children, and 15% were lone parents with dependent children. Of those aged 16–74 in Stretford, 23% had no <a href="Education%20in%20England%23Specialist%20qualifications">academic qualifications</a>, higher than the 18% in all of Trafford.

With 78% of residents born in the United Kingdom, there is a relatively high proportion of foreign-born residents reported. There is also a high proportion of non-white people, as 63% of residents were recorded as white. The largest minority group was <a href="British%20Asian">Asian</a>, at 21% of the population.

In 1931, 19% of Stretford's population was middle class and 20% working class compared to 14% middle class and 36% working class nationally. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 15% whilst the working class had grown to 31% compared to 24% middle class and 26% working class nationally.

Until the end of the 19th century Stretford was a largely agricultural village. The development of the <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000 workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still a very significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people.

The main shopping centre is Stretford Mall in the <a href="central%20business%20district">commercial centre</a> of Stretford, previously known as Stretford <a href="Arndale%20Centre">Arndale</a>. It was opened in 1969 and changed its name in 2003. Stretford Mall was built on the site of the original shopping centre in the former King Street. <a href="The%20Trafford%20Centre">The Trafford Centre</a>, a large shopping and leisure complex opened in September 1998, lies to the northwest of Stretford. Frequent shuttle buses run between Stretford <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> tram station and The Trafford Centre, about away.
According to the 2011 UK census, the industry of employment of residents in Stretford was 17% retail and wholesale, 11% health and social work, 11% education, 7% manufacturing, 6% transport and storage, 6% public administration and defence, 6% professional, scientific and technical activities, 5% hotels and restaurants, 5% construction, 5% finance, 1% energy and water supply, 0.06% agriculture and 5% other. This is roughly in line with national figures, except for the town's relatively low percentage of agricultural workers.

The 2011 census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74 as 39.3% in full-time employment, 13.6% in part-time employment, 7.5% self-employed, 5.7% unemployed, 5.9% students, 9.5% retired, 5.6% looking after home or family, and 6.1% permanently sick or disabled. The 5.7% unemployment rate in Stretford was high compared with the national rate of 3.2%. According to the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> estimates, between April 2001 and March 2002 the average gross income of households in Stretford was £415 per week (£21,664 per year).

Longford Cinema, opposite Stretford Mall, on the eastern side of the <a href="A56%20road">A56 Chester Road</a>, is perhaps the most visually striking building in the town. Designed by the architect Henry Elder, it was the height of <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> fashion when it was opened by the Mayor of Stretford in 1936. Its unusual "cash register" frontage was intended to symbolise the business aspect of show business.

The building incorporated many modern features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, and it was also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, which was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>. It also played host to the <a href="Hall%C3%A9%20Orchestra">Hallé Orchestra</a> after the orchestra's own home, the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Hall">Free Trade Hall</a>, was bombed and severely damaged during the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester Blitz</a> of 1940.

After a change of ownership in 1950, the cinema was renamed the Stretford Essoldo. It continued to operate as a cinema until 1965, when it was converted into a <a href="Bingo%20%28UK%29">bingo</a> hall, which it remained until its closure in 1995. The building has been unused since then. It was designated a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II listed</a> building in 1994.

In 2017 a proposal was put forward by Trafford Council to bring the Essoldo back into use as part of the new University Academy 92, to provide student amenities and other community facilities such as an enhanced library.

The Great Stone, which gave its name to the Great Stone Road, where it was located until being moved in 1925, is one of Stretford's most easily overlooked landmarks. The stone is composed of <a href="millstone%20grit">millstone grit</a> and was probably deposited as a <a href="glacial%20erratic">glacial erratic</a>. It is rectangular in shape, about wide, deep, and tall, with two deep rectangular slots cut into its upper surface.

Several suggestions have been made for the history of the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes in the top of the stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between <a href="Northwich">Northwich</a> and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.

When the Great Stone Road was widened in the late 19th century, the stone was moved back from the road slightly. In 1925, the stone was moved again, to its current location outside the North Lodge of Gorse Hill Park, about from its historical location. The stone is a Grade II listed structure.

Stretford Cenotaph, opposite the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was built as a memorial to the 580 Stretford men who lost their lives in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the wall behind the cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a>, Secretary of State for War.

The cenotaph is high and wide at its base. It cost £2,000 to build, raised by public subscription and a donation from the Stretford Red Cross. The memorial bears the legend "They died that we might live" on one side, and "In memory of the heroic dead" on the other. It is a Grade II listed structure.

Longford Park is the largest park in Trafford, at . It includes a pets' corner, <a href="wildlife%20garden">wildlife garden</a>, bowling greens, tennis and basketball courts, children's play areas, <a href="Disc%20golf">disc golf course</a>, and an athletics stadium, and was the finishing point of the annual Stretford Pageant. It was the site of a royal <a href="garden%20party">garden party</a> in 1977, the <a href="Silver%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II</a>. As the Manchester–Stretford boundary ran across the park until the <a href="Boundary%20Commissions%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Boundary Commission</a> moved it in 1987, part of it (including the Athletics Stadium) was in <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy">Chorlton-cum-Hardy</a>, although it was always administered by Trafford MBC.

Longford Park was the home of <a href="John%20Rylands">John Rylands</a>, industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire, from 1855 until his death in 1888 and of his widow <a href="Enriqueta%20Augustina%20Rylands">Enriqueta Augustina Rylands</a> until her death in 1908. The house Rylands constructed in the park in 1857, Longford Hall, was demolished in 1995. It replaced an earlier house of the same name that had been the residence of Thomas Walker (died 1817) and subsequently of his sons Thomas (died 1836) and Charles. Today only the front porch, coach house, and the stable buildings remain. The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers, and the park was opened to the public the following year.

Longford Park is the home of Stretford parkrun; a free, weekly 5k running event.

Stretford Public Hall was built in 1878 by <a href="John%20Rylands">John Rylands</a>. It was designed by N. Lofthouse and is on the western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford's first public lending library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.

Public baths were built to the rear of the building, accessed via Cyprus Street. In 1940 the new Stretford Library was opened on King Street, and the public hall was rendered surplus. The building re-opened in March 1949 as the Stretford Civic Theatre, with a well-equipped stage for the use of local groups. After the Stretford Leisure Centre opened in 1983 now Stretford Sports Village, the Cyprus Street Baths wing fell into disuse, and was demolished. The remainder of the building began to fall into disrepair, despite being designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987, until Trafford Council refurbished and converted the hall to serve as council offices in the mid-1990s. It was re-opened in 1997, once again named Stretford Public Hall.

Stretford Cemetery was designed by John Shaw and opened in 1885. Its chapel is in the <a href="Decorated%20style">Decorated style</a>, designed by architects Bellamy & Hardy, and quite elaborate. On the western side is a memorial to the casualties of the Second World War and to the east a newer section of the cemetery.

<a href="Trafford%20Town%20Hall">Trafford Town Hall</a> stands in a large site at the junction of Talbot Road and Warwick Road, directly opposite the <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a>. Work on the building, designed by architects <a href="Bradshaw%20Gass%20%26amp%3B%20Hope">Bradshaw Gass & Hope</a> of Bolton, began on 21 August 1931.

The town hall officially came into use as Stretford Town Hall on the granting of Stretford's charter, on 16 September 1933. In 1974, on the formation of the new Trafford Metropolitan Borough, Stretford Town Hall was adopted as the base for the new council and renamed Trafford Town Hall; it was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007.

The Union Church was formed in 1862, with John Rylands as its patron; he laid the foundation stone of its building in Edge Lane, close to Longford Park's southern entrance, in 1867. In the latter part of the 20th century the church was converted into office accommodation but by the early 21st century was standing empty. In 2012 it was restored to its original use a church having been bought by the Church of Christ – Iglesia ni Cristo.

<a href="Stretford%20Metrolink%20station">Stretford Metrolink station</a> is part of the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> tram system, and lies on the <a href="Altrincham">Altrincham</a> to <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a> line. Trams leave about every six minutes between 7:15 and 18:30, and every 12 minutes at other times of the day. The nearest main line railway station is <a href="Trafford%20Park%20railway%20station">Trafford Park</a>, on the Liverpool to Manchester line. Services are roughly every two hours in each direction, with extra services calling during the peak hours. The Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, opened in 1993, is in the Gorse Hill area of Stretford. It cost £11 million and has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year. The containers are handled by two huge gantry cranes, the noise from which has led to complaints from some local residents.

The town has good access to the motorway network. Junction 7 of the <a href="M60%20motorway">M60</a> is just to the north of Stretford's boundary with <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a>, and the <a href="A56%20road">A56 road</a> gives easy access to the south as well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction. Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.

<a href="Manchester%20Airport">Manchester Airport</a>, the busiest in the UK outside London, is about to the south of Stretford.

Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the <a href="11-plus">11-plus</a> examination.
The proportion of pupils leaving <a href="Stretford%20Grammar%20School">Stretford Grammar School</a> with five or more <a href="General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education">GCSEs</a> at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist <a href="Science%20College">Science College</a> status in September 2005. The school was assessed as "good" in its April 2015 <a href="Office%20for%20Standards%20in%20Education">Ofsted</a> report.

Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as "satisfactory" in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an "outstanding" assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection. GCSE results also placed the school in the top 1% of schools in the country for adding value to its students.

Stretford also has the specialist Arts College, <a href="Lostock%20College">Lostock College</a>.

Plans to build a new university in the town, to be known as University Academy 92, were announced in September 2017. A branch of <a href="Lancaster%20University">Lancaster University</a>, it hopes to welcome the first of its anticipated 6500 students in September 2019. The campus is to be built on the Kelloggs headquarters site on Talbot Road, which has already been acquired by Trafford Council for £12 million.

The date of the first church to be built in Stretford is unrecorded, but in a lease dated 1413, land is described as lying next to a chapel. Many of the present day churches in the area were constructed during the late 19th and early 20th century, as the population of Stretford began to grow.

<a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> was a significant influence in 19th-century Stretford, but of the seventeen churches in the town today, only one is Methodist whereas five are <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. The Catholic mission in Stretford was begun in 1859, in a small chapel on Herbert Street.

As at the 2011 UK census, 51% of Stretford residents reported themselves as being Christian, 18% as <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, and 3% as <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>. No other religion was represented at higher than 1% of the population, with 20% reporting themselves as having no religion.

Stretford is in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Salford">Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford</a>, and the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Manchester">Anglican Diocese of Manchester</a>.

There are two <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II listed</a> churches in Stretford: the Church of <a href="St%20Ann%27s%2C%20Stretford">St Ann</a> and the Church of St Matthew. St Ann's is a Roman Catholic church, built in 1862–67 by <a href="E.%20W.%20Pugin">E. W. Pugin</a> for <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20de%20Trafford">Sir Humphrey</a> and Lady Annette de Trafford. It was officially opened by <a href="William%20Turner%20%28Bishop%20of%20Salford%29">Bishop William Turner</a> on 22 November 1863, and was <a href="consecration">consecrated</a> in June 1867. Features include a historic organ built by Jardine & Co (1867) and a good number of fine stained glass windows by Hardman & Co of Birmingham. St Matthew's church was built in 1842 by W. Hayley in the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style, with additional phases in 1869, 1906 and 1922.

Stretford has been the home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United Football Club</a> since 1910, when the club moved to its present <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28football%29">Old Trafford</a> ground, the western end of which is still unofficially called the <a href="Stretford%20End">Stretford End</a>.
<a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> was originally the home of <a href="Manchester%20Cricket%20Club">Manchester Cricket Club</a>, but became the home of <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire County Cricket Club</a> in 1864 upon that club's formation. The ground is on Talbot Road, Stretford, where it has been since 1856. Similar to its counterpart, one end of the Old Trafford cricket ground is called the Stretford End. It has been a test venue since 1884 and has hosted three <a href="Cricket%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> semi-finals. After the 2005 Ashes Test, when more than 20,000 fans had to be turned away, the decision was made to increase the ground's capacity from 20,000 to 25,000. Initial plans included building a new stadium on the site of Trafford Town Hall, opposite the present ground. Trafford Council voted against the demolition of the town hall and instead, in 2007, signed an agreement jointly with Lancashire County Cricket Club, Ask Developments, and <a href="Tesco">Tesco</a>, to redevelop the ground on its present site. The new cricket ground will be at the heart of a development that will also include business space, residential, retail, hotel and leisure facilities. More than £25 million is expected to be invested in the redevelopments at Old Trafford.

Stretford Stadium, adjoining Longford Park, is the home of Trafford Athletic Club. Trafford is one of the UK's top athletic clubs, with more than 100 members having competed at international level.

The Stretford Sports Village run by Trafford Community Leisure Trust comprises two main centres: the original Stretford Leisure Centre, now called the Chester Centre, and the facility at Stretford High School called the Talbot Centre. The Stretford Sports Village is between Manchester United Football Club's Old Trafford Stadium and Lancashire County Cricket Club's Old Trafford Ground. The centres have a 25-metre main pool, a 20-metre children's pool, four gyms, a table tennis room, twelve badminton courts, two <a href="five-a-side%20football">five-a-side</a> courts, a spinning studio, practice hall, training rooms, community room, a cafe, an outdoor full-size floodlight <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> pitch and a full-size grass pitch. <a href="Sale%20Water%20Park">Trafford Water Sports Centre</a> lies just across Stretford's southern border with Sale, about from Stretford town centre.

Although Stretford town centre is busy during the day, there is very little in the way of a night-time economy. There are no restaurants or other entertainments except for a number of <a href="public%20houses">public houses</a> and members-only social clubs. There are two public libraries: Greatstone Library, part of Stretford Sports Village, and Stretford Library, both run by Trafford Council.

The Stretford Pageant is an annual Rose Queen festival held on the last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a procession of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park on the day of the pageant, such as a fun fair and a <a href="car%20boot%20sale">car boot sale</a>. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.

"<a href="The%20Stretford%20Wives">The Stretford Wives</a>" is a television drama that was broadcast by the BBC in August 2002, watched by 5.7 million viewers. Written by <a href="Danny%20Brocklehurst">Danny Brocklehurst</a>, it is the story of three sisters living in Stretford, although most of the filming took place in nearby Salford. The programme received a mixed critical reception.

The <a href="Stretford%20process">Stretford process</a> was developed at the North-Western Gas Board's laboratories in Stretford during the 1940s. It was the first liquid phase oxidation process for removing hydrogen sulphide (HS) from <a href="town%20gas">town gas</a> to be commercially successful. Many Stretford plants were built worldwide.

Policing in Stretford is the responsibility of the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Police">Greater Manchester Police</a>, who have their headquarters in the town. The force's "M" Division, responsible for policing in Trafford, is also based in Stretford, close to Trafford Town Hall.

<a href="Waste%20management">Waste management</a> is co-ordinated by the local authority via the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Waste%20Disposal%20Authority">Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority</a>.

Perhaps fittingly for an area so close to Trafford Park, the world's first planned industrial estate, one of the world's first industrial espionage agents, John Holker, was born in Stretford, in 1719.

Two of Stretford's famous residents were the <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> and the painter <a href="L.%20S.%20Lowry">L. S.

Manchester's first multi-millionaire <a href="John%20Rylands">John Rylands</a> and his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands lived at Longford Hall in Stretford during the later parts of their lives. The radical firebrand socialist, and later post-war politician <a href="Herschel%20Austin">Herschel Lewis Austin</a> (1911–1974) served Stretford as a Labour Member of Parliament between 1945 and 1950.

Palazzo Pitti

The Palazzo Pitti (), in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, is a vast, mainly <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="palace">palace</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. It is situated on the south side of the <a href="Arno%20River">River Arno</a>, a short distance from the <a href="Ponte%20Vecchio">Ponte Vecchio</a>. The core of the present <a href="palazzo">palazzo</a> dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of <a href="Luca%20Pitti">Luca Pitti</a>, an ambitious Florentine banker.

The palace was bought by the <a href="House%20of%20Medici">Medici family</a> in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy">Grand Duchy</a> of <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions.

In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used as a power base by <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">King Victor Emmanuel III</a> in 1919.

The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres. It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.

The construction of this severe and forbidding building was commissioned in 1458 by the Florentine banker <a href="Luca%20Pitti">Luca Pitti</a> (1398-1472), a principal supporter and friend of <a href="Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo de' Medici</a>. The early history of the Palazzo Pitti is a mixture of fact and myth. Pitti is alleged to have instructed that the windows be larger than the entrance of the <a href="Palazzo%20Medici%20Riccardi">Palazzo Medici</a>. The 16th-century art historian <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> proposed that <a href="Filippo%20Brunelleschi">Brunelleschi</a> was the palazzo's <a href="architect">architect</a>, and that his pupil <a href="Luca%20Fancelli">Luca Fancelli</a> was merely his assistant in the task, but today it is Fancelli who is generally credited. Besides obvious differences from the elder architect's style, Brunelleschi died 12 years before construction of the palazzo began. The design and <a href="window">fenestration</a> suggest that the unknown architect was more experienced in utilitarian domestic architecture than in the <a href="Humanism">humanist</a> rules defined by <a href="Leone%20Battista%20Alberti">Alberti</a> in his book "<a href="De%20Re%20Aedificatoria">De Re Aedificatoria</a>".

Though impressive, the original palazzo would have been no rival to the Florentine Medici residences in terms of either size or content. Whoever the architect of the Palazzo Pitti was, he was moving against the contemporary flow of fashion. The <a href="rustication%20%28architecture%29">rusticated</a> stonework gives the palazzo a severe and powerful atmosphere, reinforced by the three-times-repeated series of seven arch-headed apertures, reminiscent of a <a href="Roman%20aqueduct">Roman aqueduct</a>. The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a>-style architecture appealed to the Florentine love of the new style "all'antica". This original design has withstood the test of time: the repetitive formula of the façade was continued during the subsequent additions to the palazzo, and its influence can be seen in numerous 16th-century imitations and 19th-century revivals. Work stopped after Pitti suffered financial losses following the death of Cosimo de' Medici in 1464. Luca Pitti died in 1472 with the building unfinished.

The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti, a descendant of Luca Pitti, to <a href="Eleonora%20di%20Toledo">Eleonora di Toledo</a>. Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of <a href="Cosimo%20I%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo I de' Medici</a> of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a> enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the <a href="Vasari%20Corridor">Vasari Corridor</a>, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the <a href="Palazzo%20Vecchio">Palazzo Vecchio</a>, through the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a>, above the <a href="Ponte%20Vecchio">Ponte Vecchio</a> to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the <a href="Palazzo%20Vecchio">Palazzo Vecchio</a>. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son <a href="Francesco%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Francesco I</a> and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.

Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the <a href="Boboli%20Gardens">Boboli Gardens</a>. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Tribolo">Niccolò Tribolo</a>, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by <a href="Bartolommeo%20Ammanati">Bartolommeo Ammanati</a>. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the "<a href="corps%20de%20logis">corps de logis</a>" of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was "<a href="Andria%20%28comedy%29">Andria</a>" by <a href="Terence">Terence</a> in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as <a href="Giovan%20Battista%20Cini">Giovan Battista Cini</a>. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect <a href="Baldassarre%20Lanci">Baldassarre Lanci</a>.

With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian "palais" of <a href="Maria%20de%27%20Medici">Maria de' Medici</a>, the <a href="Luxembourg%20Palace">Luxembourg</a>. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the "finestre inginocchiate" ("kneeling" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a "<a href="prie-dieu">prie-dieu</a>", a device of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the "<a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>", and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a <a href="grotto">grotto</a>, called the "grotto of Moses" on account of the <a href="porphyry%20%28geology%29">porphyry</a> statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the "piano nobile" windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the "Fontana del Carciofo" ("Fountain of the Artichoke"), designed by <a href="Giambologna">Giambologna</a>'s former assistant, <a href="Francesco%20Susini">Francesco Susini</a>, and completed in 1641.

In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. <a href="Giulio%20Parigi">Giulio Parigi</a> won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by <a href="Alfonso%20Parigi">Alfonso Parigi</a>. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect <a href="Giuseppe%20Ruggeri">Giuseppe Ruggeri</a> to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a <a href="piazza">piazza</a> centered on the façade, the prototype of the "<a href="cour%20d%27honneur">cour d'honneur</a>" that was copied in France. Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.

To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by <a href="Bernardo%20Buontalenti">Bernardo Buontalenti</a>. The lower façade was begun by <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a> but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by "dripping" pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with <a href="Giambologna">Giambologna</a>'s Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.

The palazzo remained the principal Medici residence until the <a href="Gian%20Gastone%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">last male Medici heir</a> died in 1737. It was then occupied briefly by his sister, the elderly <a href="Anna%20Maria%20Luisa%20de%27%20Medici">Electress Palatine</a>; on her death, the Medici dynasty became extinct and the palazzo passed to the new <a href="Grand%20Dukes%20of%20Tuscany">Grand Dukes of Tuscany</a>, the Austrian <a href="House%20of%20Lorraine">House of Lorraine</a>, in the person of <a href="Francis%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. The Austrian tenancy was briefly interrupted by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, who used the palazzo during his period of control over Italy.

When Tuscany passed from the House of Lorraine to the <a href="House%20of%20Savoy">House of Savoy</a> in 1860, the Palazzo Pitti was included. After the <a href="Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a>, when Florence was briefly the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20II">Victor Emmanuel II</a> resided in the palazzo until 1871. His grandson, <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III">Victor Emmanuel III</a>, presented the palazzo to the nation in 1919. The palazzo and other buildings in the Boboli Gardens were then divided into five separate art galleries and a museum, housing not only many of its original contents, but priceless artefacts from many other collections acquired by the state. The 140 rooms open to the public are part of an interior, which is in large part a later product than the original portion of the structure, mostly created in two phases, one in the 17th century and the other in the early 18th century. Some earlier interiors remain, and there are still later additions such as the Throne Room. In 2005 the surprise discovery of forgotten 18th-century bathrooms in the palazzo revealed remarkable examples of contemporary plumbing very similar in style to the bathrooms of the 21st century.

The Palatine Gallery, the main gallery of Palazzo Pitti, contains a large ensemble of <a href="list%20of%20works%20in%20the%20palatine%20gallery">over 500 principally Renaissance paintings</a>, which were once part of the Medicis' and their successors' private art collection. The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Perugino">Perugino</a> ("<a href="Lamentation%20over%20the%20Dead%20Christ%20%28Perugino%29">Lamentation over the Dead Christ</a>"), <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a>, <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, and <a href="Pietro%20da%20Cortona">Pietro da Cortona</a>. The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much as they would have been in the grand rooms for which they were intended rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.

The finest rooms were decorated by Pietro da Cortona in the high <a href="baroque">baroque</a> style. Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the "piano nobile" called the Sala della Stufa with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received; the "Age of Gold" and "Age of Silver" were painted in 1637, followed in 1641 by the "Age of Bronze" and "Age of Iron". They are regarded among his masterpieces. The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms; a suite of five rooms at the front of the palazzo. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (the Medici Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Cortona left Florence in 1647, and his pupil and collaborator, <a href="Ciro%20Ferri">Ciro Ferri</a>, completed the cycle by the 1660s. They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a>'s <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>, designed by <a href="Charles%20Le%20Brun">Le Brun</a>.

The collection was first opened to the public in the late 18th century, albeit rather reluctantly, by Grand Duke <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold</a>, Tuscany's first enlightened ruler, keen to obtain popularity after the demise of the Medici.

The Palatine Gallery has 28 rooms, among them:



The Royal Apartments include 14 rooms. Their decoration has been changed to Empire style by the Savoy, but there are still some rooms maintaining decorations and furniture from the age of the Medici.

The Green Room, was frescoed by <a href="Giuseppe%20Castagnoli">Giuseppe Castagnoli</a> in early 19th Century. It exhibits an Intarsia Cabinet from the 17th century and a Collection of Gilded Bronzes; the Throne Room was decorated for King Vittorio Emanuele II of Savoy and is characterized by the red brocate on the walls and by the Japanese and Chinese Vases (17th-18th century).

The Blue Room contains collected Furniture (17th-18th century) and the Portraits of members of the Medici Family painted by Justus Sustermans (1597–1681).

This is a suite of 14 rooms, formerly used by the Medici family, and lived in by their successors. These rooms have been largely altered since the era of the Medici, most recently in the 19th century. They contain a collection of Medici portraits, many of them by the artist <a href="Giusto%20Sustermans">Giusto Sustermans</a>. In contrast to the great salons containing the Palatine collection, some of these rooms are much smaller and more intimate, and, while still grand and gilded, are more suited to day-to-day living requirements. Period furnishings include four-poster beds and other necessary furnishings not found elsewhere in the palazzo. The Kings of Italy last used the Palazzo Pitti in the 1920s. By that time it had already been converted to a museum, but a suite of rooms (now the Gallery of Modern Art) was reserved for them when visiting Florence officially.

This gallery originates from the remodeling of the Florentine academy in 1748, when a gallery of Modern Art was established. The gallery was intended to hold those art works which were prize-winners in the academy's competitions. The Palazzo Pitti was being redecorated on a grand scale at this time and the new works of art were being collected to adorn the newly decorated salons. By the mid-19th century so numerous were the Grand Ducal paintings of modern art that many were transferred to the , which became the first home of the newly formed "Modern Art Museum".

Following the <a href="Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a> and the expulsion of the Grand Ducal family from the palazzo, all the Grand Ducal modern art works were brought together under one roof in the newly titled "Modern gallery of the Academy". The collection continued to expand, particularly so under the patronage of <a href="Vittorio%20Emanuele%20II">Vittorio Emanuele II</a>. However it was not until 1922 that this gallery was moved to the Palazzo Pitti where it was complemented by further modern works of art in the ownership of both the state and the municipality of Florence. The collection was housed in apartments recently vacated by members of the Italian Royal family. The gallery was first opened to public viewing in 1928.

Today, further enlarged and spread over 30 rooms, this large collection includes works by artists of the <a href="Macchiaioli">Macchiaioli</a> movement and other modern Italian schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The pictures by the Macchiaioli artists are of particular note, as this school of 19th-century Tuscan painters led by <a href="Giovanni%20Fattori">Giovanni Fattori</a> were early pioneers and the founders of the impressionist movement. The title "gallery of modern art" to some may sound incorrect, as the art in the gallery covers the period from the 18th to the early 20th century. No examples of later art are included in the collection since In Italy, "modern art" refers to the period before World War II; what has followed is generally known as "contemporary art" ("arte contemporanea"). In Tuscany this art can be found at the <a href="Centro%20per%20l%27arte%20contemporanea%20Luigi%20Pecci">Centro per l'arte contemporanea Luigi Pecci</a> at <a href="Prato">Prato</a>, a city about from Florence.

The Silver Museum, sometimes called "The Medici Treasury", contains a collection of priceless silver, <a href="cameo%20%28carving%29">cameo</a>s, and works in semi-precious <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>s, many of the latter from the collection of <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a>, including his collection of ancient vases, many with delicate silver gilt mounts added for display purposes in the 15th century. These rooms, formerly part of the private royal apartments, are decorated with 17th-century <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es, the most splendid being by <a href="Giovanni%20da%20San%20Giovanni">Giovanni da San Giovanni</a>, from 1635 to 1636. The Silver Museum also contains a fine collection of German gold and silver artefacts purchased by Grand Duke <a href="Ferdinand%20III%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Ferdinand</a> after his return from exile in 1815, following the French occupation.

First opened in 1973, this museum is housed in the Casino del Cavaliere in the Boboli Gardens. The porcelain is from many of the most notable European porcelain factories, with <a href="S%C3%A8vres%20porcelain">Sèvres</a> and <a href="Meissen">Meissen</a> near <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> being well represented. Many items in the collection were gifts to the Florentine rulers from other European sovereigns, while other works were specially commissioned by the Grand Ducal court. Of particular note are several large dinner services by the <a href="Vincennes%20porcelain">Vincennes</a> factory, later renamed Sèvres, and a collection of small <a href="Bisque%20%28pottery%29">biscuit</a> <a href="figurine">figurine</a>s.

Situated in a wing known as the "", this gallery contains a collection of theatrical costumes dating from the 16th century until the present. It is also the only museum in Italy detailing the history of Italian fashions. One of the newer collections to the palazzo, it was founded in 1983 by <a href="Kirsten%20Aschengreen%20Piacenti">Kirsten Aschengreen Piacenti</a>; a suite of fourteen rooms, the Meridiana apartments, were completed in 1858.

In addition to theatrical costumes, the gallery displays garments worn between the 18th century and the present day. Some of the exhibits are unique to the Palazzo Pitti; these include the 16th-century funeral clothes of Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, and his wife Eleonora of Toledo and their son Garzia, both of whom died of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Their bodies would have been displayed <a href="Lying%20in%20state">in state</a> wearing their finest clothes, before being reclad in plainer attire before <a href="burial">interment</a>. The gallery also exhibits a collection of mid-20th century <a href="costume%20jewellery">costume jewellery</a>. The "Sala Meridiana" originally sponsored a functional solar meridian instrument, built into the fresco decoration by <a href="Anton%20Domenico%20Gabbiani">Anton Domenico Gabbiani</a>.

This ground floor museum exhibits <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s and other conveyances used by the Grand Ducal court mainly in the late 18th and 19th century. The extent of the exhibition prompted one visitor in the 19th century to wonder, "In the name of all that is extraordinary, how can they find room for all these carriages and horses". Some of the carriages are highly decorative, being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels. Those used on the grandest occasions, such as the "Carrozza d'Oro" (golden carriage), are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station of the carriage's occupants. Other carriages on view are those used by the King of the <a href="Two%20Sicilies">Two Sicilies</a>, and <a href="Archbishop">Archbishop</a>s and other Florentine dignitaries.

Today, transformed from royal palace to museum, the Palazzo is in the hands of the Italian state through the "Polo Museale Fiorentino", an institution which administers twenty museums, including the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi Gallery</a>, and has ultimate responsibility for 250,000 catalogued works of art. In spite of its metamorphosis from royal residence to a state-owned public building, the palazzo, sitting on its elevated site overlooking Florence, still retains the air and atmosphere of a private collection in a grand house. This is to a great extent due to the "Amici di Palazzo Pitti" (Friends of the Palazzo Pitti), an organisation of <a href="Volunteering">volunteer</a>s and <a href="patronage">patrons</a> founded in 1996, which raises funds and makes suggestions for the ongoing maintenance of the palazzo and the collections, and for the continuing improvement of their visual display.

The <a href="Munich%20Residenz%23The%20K%C3%B6nigsbau">Königsbau</a> wing ('King's building / den') of the <a href="Munich%20Residenz">Munich Residenz</a>, the former royal palace in the capital of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, was modelled after the Palazzo Pitti.

The storyline followed <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a> on his journey to stop <a href="Dr.%20Robotnik">Dr. Robotnik</a> stealing six magic rings from Tiara Boobowski and her father.

"X-treme" was conceived as a <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> platform game for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> to succeed "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a>" (1994). Development shifted to the <a href="32X">32X</a> and then the Saturn and <a href="Windows">Windows</a>, and the game was redesigned as a 3D platform game for the 1996 holiday season. The plan was disrupted by company politics, an unfavorable visit by <a href="Sega">Sega of Japan</a> executives, and obstacles using a <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> developed by <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> for another project. Staff illness made it impossible to finish "X-treme" on time, leading to its cancellation. A film tie-in with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> was also canceled.

In place of "X-treme", Sega released a <a href="Porting">port</a> of the Genesis game "<a href="Sonic%203D%20Blast">Sonic 3D Blast</a>", but did not release an original 3D "Sonic" platform game until "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>" for the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> in 1998. The cancellation is considered an important factor in the Saturn's <a href="list%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>, as it left the system with no original "Sonic" platform game. Elements similar to those in "X-treme" appeared in later games, such as "<a href="Sonic%20Lost%20World">Sonic Lost World</a>" (2013).

"X-treme" was a <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> in which players controlled <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, with the ability to move in any direction. Gameplay was similar to the Saturn platform game "<a href="Bug%21">Bug!</a>", though producer Mike Wallis said that "X-treme" would differ in that Sonic would be free to roam levels, unconstrained by linear paths. The game featured a <a href="Fisheye%20lens">fisheye</a> camera system, the "Reflex Lens", that gave players a wide-angle view, making levels appear to move around Sonic. Levels would rotate around a fixed center of gravity, meaning Sonic could run up walls, arriving at what was previously the ceiling. Sonic was also able to enter and exit the screen as he moved. For <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> battles, levels were "free-roaming" and "arena-style'", and rendered bosses as polygonal characters as opposed to <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>. These levels used shading, transparency, and lighting effects to showcase the Saturn's technical potential.

The developers wanted to take Sonic into the modern era, while building on the series' successes. In 1996, Wallis said: "We plan to have all of [the familiar Sonic] elements in the game, as well as additional ones. We're giving Sonic new moves, because Sonic is a hedgehog of the times, we're bringing him up to speed." In line with other "Sonic" games, "X-treme" emphasized speed and featured collectable <a href="Rings%20%28Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%29">rings</a>. Additions included the abilities to throw rings at enemies, create a shield from rings, do spinning midair attacks, strike enemies below with a "Power Ball" attack, jump higher with less control than normal, and execute a "Sonic Boom" attack, in concert with the shield, that struck in 360 degrees. <a href="Surfing">Surfing</a> and <a href="bungee%20jumping">bungee jumping</a> were included as activities considered <a href="Cool%20%28aesthetic%29">cool</a> at the time.

At least four stages were developed: Jade Gully, Red Sands, Galaxy Fortress, and Crystal Frost. Lead designer <a href="Chris%20Senn%20%28video%20game%20designer%29">Chris Senn</a> stated that he <a href="3D%20modeling">modeled</a> and <a href="Texture%20mapping">textured</a> four main characters, as well as designs for 50 enemies and an hour of music. <a href="List%20of%20Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20characters%23Fang%20the%20Sniper">Fang the Sniper</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20characters%23Metal%20Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> were planned as bosses. The plot described in promotional materials involves a Tiara Boobowski, who was set to become a major character, and her father calling on Sonic to help defend the six magical Rings of Order from <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Dr. Robotnik</a>.

The original "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" was developed by <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> in Japan. Released in 1991, it greatly increased the popularity of the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> in North America. After its release, developer <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> and other Japanese staff relocated to <a href="California">California</a> to join <a href="Sega%20Technical%20Institute">Sega Technical Institute</a> (STI), a development division led by <a href="Mark%20Cerny">Mark Cerny</a>. Cerny aimed to establish an elite development studio combining the design philosophies of American and Japanese developers.

In 1991, STI began developing several games, including "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>," which was released the following year. Though "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" was successful, the language barrier and cultural differences created a rift between the Japanese and American developers. Once development ended, Cerny departed STI and was replaced by former <a href="Atari">Atari</a> employee Roger Hector. The American staff developed "<a href="Sonic%20Spinball">Sonic Spinball</a>", while the Japanese staff developed "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%203">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>" and "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a>". According to developer <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>, the Japanese team experimented with <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a> for "Sonic 3", but were unable to implement them with the limited power of the Genesis. After "Sonic & Knuckles" was completed in 1994, Naka returned to Japan to continue work with Sonic Team.

At the time, Sega of Japan and Sega of America ran as separate entities, and relations were not always smooth. Some of this conflict may have been caused by Sega president <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a> and his admiration for Sega of America; according to former Sega of America CEO <a href="Tom%20Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a>, "There were some guys in the executive suites who really didn't like that Nakayama in particular appeared to favor the US executives. A lot of the Japanese executives were maybe a little jealous, and I think some of that played into the decisions that were made." By contrast, author <a href="Steven%20L.%20Kent">Steven L. Kent</a> wrote that Nakayama bullied American executives and believed the Japanese executives made the best decisions. According to Hector, after the release of the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> in 1994, the atmosphere at Sega became political, with "lots of finger-pointing".

After Naka's return to Japan with his team in late 1994, STI was left with mostly American staff. Early ideas for the next "Sonic" game included the experimental "Sonic Crackers", which became "<a href="Knuckles%27%20Chaotix">Knuckles' Chaotix</a>" for the <a href="32X">32X</a>. Development of "Sonic X-treme" began in late 1994 at STI. Michael Kosaka was executive producer and team leader, and designer and <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> artist Senn created animations to pitch the game to Sega executives. "Sonic X-treme" was conceived for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> as a side-scrolling <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> like previous "Sonic" games. As new consoles and the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">32-bit era</a> were on the way, the game was moved to the 32X under the working titles "Sonic 32X" and "Sonic Mars" after the "Project Mars" codename used for the 32X. The initial 32X design was for an <a href="2.5D">isometric</a> side-scroller, but became a full 3D game with a view set on a floating plane. Kosaka completed <a href="Software%20design%20description">design documents</a> for the 32X version before the 32X was released, without a clear picture of the hardware.

In mid-1995, Kosaka resigned. According to Senn, "[Kosaka] and the executive producer Dean Lester were not getting along, and I believe Michael felt it was his best option to simply remove himself from what he thought was a politically unhealthy environment." Lester resigned later in 1995 and was replaced by Manny Granillo. Wallis, who had worked on the Genesis games "<a href="The%20Ooze">The Ooze</a>" and "<a href="Comix%20Zone">Comix Zone</a>", was promoted to producer and placed in charge of "Sonic X-treme". Lead programmer Don Goddard was replaced with Ofer Alon, who some staff felt was difficult to work with, saying he did not share his work. As the design had changed significantly and the 32X struggled commercially, development moved to a planned Sega cartridge console to be powered by <a href="nVidia">nVidia</a> 3D hardware, to compete with the upcoming <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>. Wallis said this request was made without hardware specifications. After Sega of Japan announced that Sega would focus solely on the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, development shifted again. When Naka visited STI and observed the "X-treme" development, he simply said "good luck".

 The Saturn version was developed by two teams with two different <a href="Game%20engine">game engines</a>, starting in the second half of 1995. One team, led by STI tech director Robert Morgan and including programmer Chris Coffin, developed the free-roaming boss levels. This engine used tools used by Saturn games such as "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20II%20Zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>" and rendered bosses as fully polygonal characters. The other team, led by Senn and Alon, developed the main levels, working on PC with the intent of porting their work to Saturn. Alon and Senn focused on building an <a href="Game%20creation%20system">editor</a> to construct the main levels. Music and backgrounds could not be coded in the editor, and had to be coded manually for each level. Enemies were created as <a href="Pre-rendering">pre-rendered</a> sprites.

Other staff included composer <a href="Howard%20Drossin">Howard Drossin</a>, lead artist Ross Harris, artist/designers Fei Cheng and Andrew Probert, and designers Jason Kuo and Richard Wheeler. According to Senn, his team was completely different from the STI teams led by Naka; this, combined with their inexperience, "set up seeds of doubt and a political landmine waiting to go off if we didn't produce amazing results quickly." Wallis stated that STI shifted its resources toward "Sonic X-treme" in late 1995. He expressed frustration with the team structure, and felt that internal politics hampered development. Coffin felt the division of responsibilities would ensure every element was perfect.Other difficulties arose from the design. According to Wallis, "The theme of the game was to take basic "Sonic" [2D side-scrolling] and add the ability to have him go into and out of the screen. On paper that sounded great, but when we actually started to implement it, the addition created some design challenges we didn't initially account for." <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a> were new, and developers were still learning how they would affect controls and gameplay. Programming for the Saturn proved difficult; as Alon could not get his engine, developed on Windows, to run fast enough on Saturn, Morgan outsourced the port to a third party.

In March 1996, Sega of Japan representatives visited STI to evaluate progress. Senn and other sources indicate that the key visitor was president Nakayama, though Wallis recalls executive vice president <a href="Shoichiro%20Irimajiri">Shoichiro Irimajiri</a>. The executive was unimpressed by Senn and Alon's work, as the version he saw, ported from PC to Saturn by the third party, ran at a poor <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>. Senn and Alon attempted to show their most recent PC version, but the visitor was "taken away" before they had the opportunity. The visitor was impressed by Coffin's boss engine, and requested that "X-treme" be reworked around it. Concerned about the need to create essentially a new game before the strict December 1996 deadline, Wallis isolated Coffin's team, preventing outside influence. The team consisted of four artists, two programmers, a contractor, and three designers, set up in an old STI location. The team worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day. According to Wallis, "Coffin actually left his apartment, cancelling his lease, moved all his belongings into the office, and worked day and night."In April, Sega executive vice president <a href="Bernie%20Stolar">Bernie Stolar</a> approached STI and asked what he could do to help the game meet its deadline. At Wallis' suggestion, he provided the tools and <a href="source%20code">source code</a> for Sonic Team's 3D Saturn game "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams">Nights into Dreams</a>". Two weeks later, Stolar requested that the team stop using the engine, as Naka had threatened to leave Sega if it were used. Senn said: "Personally, I can understand Naka's interest in keeping technology his team developed under tight control. "Sonic" was a franchise he clearly felt should be handled solely by Sonic Team... He must have felt very strongly about it if he was willing to even threaten to quit." Sonic Team was also developing its own 3D "Sonic" game using the "Nights" engine, which may have motivated Naka's threat. The loss of the "Nights" engine cost the "Sonic X-treme" team two weeks of development. 

In May 1996, Sega displayed a playable demo of "X-treme" at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 1996, and displayed a version of Coffin's engine. By this time, team morale had dropped and <a href="Turnover%20%28employment%29">turnover</a> was high. Wallis claims that he fired an artist for not pulling his weight and for disrupting the team. By August, Coffin had contracted severe <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Wallis praised Coffin's effort, calling him a "human dynamo", but said that Coffin had "worked himself into the ground" and that the team had no chance of meeting its deadline without him. Around the same time, Senn became so ill that he was told he had six months to live, though he survived. With both teams crippled, and only two months left before the deadline, Wallis canceled the game.

Sega initially stated that "X-treme" had been delayed, but in early 1997 announced that it had been canceled. For the 1996 holiday season, Sega instead concentrated on Sonic Team's "Nights into Dreams," and a port of the Genesis game "<a href="Sonic%203D%20Blast">Sonic 3D Blast</a>" by <a href="Traveller%27s%20Tales">Traveller's Tales</a>, which Wallis contributed to. STI developer Peter Morawiec requested that "X-treme" be reworked into bonus stages in "3D Blast", but Traveller's Tales was unable to properly transfer Sonic's model. Sonic Team's work on a Saturn 3D "Sonic" game became "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>" for the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>. Remnants of their prototype can be seen in the Saturn compilation game "<a href="Sonic%20Jam">Sonic Jam</a>". 

After the visit from Sega of Japan in March 1996, Senn and Alon continued to develop "X-treme" using Alon's engine, hoping to pitch it to Sega's PC division. Senn felt it could have been completed with an additional six to twelve months. However, Sega's PC division would not pay for its development, and may have been hesitant after the engine had been rejected for "X-treme". After the project was rejected, Alon left Sega. Sega of America disbanded STI in 1996 following management changes. STI's Roger Hector believed that the success of PlayStation led to corporate turmoil within Sega that resulted in STI's dissolution. According to Wallis, STI was restructured as Sega of America's product development department after the previous product development department had become <a href="SegaSoft">SegaSoft</a>.

In August 1994, Sega of America signed a deal with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> and Trilogy Entertainment to produce a <a href="live-action%20animated%20film">live-action animated film</a> based on "Sonic the Hedgehog" and tie into "Sonic X-treme." In May 1995, screenwriter <a href="Richard%20Jefferies%20%28screenwriter%29">Richard Jeffries</a> pitched a treatment to Sega titled "Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World". The treatment saw Sonic and Dr Robotnik escaping from "Sonic X-treme" into the real world. The film was canceled as none of the companies could come to an agreement.

"Sonic X-treme"'s cancellation is cited as a key reason the Saturn failed. While Sega claimed up to 55% of the console market in 1994, by August 1997, <a href="Sony">Sony</a> controlled 47%, Nintendo 40%, and Sega only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases could save the console. The Saturn never received an exclusive "Sonic" platform game; instead it received a port of the Genesis game "Sonic 3D Blast;" as well as "Sonic Jam", a compilation of past "Sonic" games featuring a 3D level.

Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact "X-treme" might have had had it been released. David Houghton of "<a href="GamesRadar%2B">GamesRadar+</a>" described the prospect of "a good 3D "Sonic" game" on the Saturn as "a 'What if...' situation on a par with the dinosaurs not becoming extinct." "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" Travis Fahs described "X-treme" as "an empty vessel for Sega's ambitions and the hopes of their fans ... It was the turning point not only for Sega's mascot and their 32-bit console, but for the entire company." Levi Buchanan, also writing for "IGN", stated that "while the lack of a true Sonic sequel for the Saturn certainly didn't wholly destroy the console's chances, the lack of appearances by the Sega mascot sure didn't help matters much." Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan site, said: "I don't know if ["X-treme"] could've saved the Saturn, but ... "Sonic" helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn't a great new "Sonic" title ready at or near the launch of the [Saturn]". 

In a 2007 retrospective, producer Wallis said that "X-treme" "definitely would have been competitive" with Nintendo's "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>." Senn believed that a version of "X-treme" built by him with Alon's engine could have sold well. By contrast, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" said that "X-treme" did not compare well to competition such as "Super Mario 64" and "<a href="Crash%20Bandicoot%20%28video%20game%29">Crash Bandicoot</a>", and would have damaged Sega's reputation. Naka was also dissatisfied with the game; in a 2012 interview, he recalled being relieved when he learned it had been cancelled. Journalists also noted similarities in level themes and mechanics between "X-treme" and the 2013 game "<a href="Sonic%20Lost%20World">Sonic Lost World</a>".

For years, little content from "X-treme" was released beyond promotional screenshots. In 2006, a copy of an early test engine was sold at auction for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2500 to an anonymous collector. An animated <a href="GIF">GIF</a> image of gameplay was released, and after a fundraising project by the "Assemblergames" website community purchased the disc from the collector, the <a href="disk%20image">disk image</a> was <a href="Internet%20leak">leaked</a> on July 17, 2007. Senn opened the ""Sonic X-treme" Compendium" website and revealed large amounts of development history, including early footage, a playable character named Tiara, and concept music. Senn considered finishing "X-treme" himself, and used some of its concepts in a "Sonic" fan game. In February 2015, fans obtained the "Sonic X-treme" source code and created a playable build.

School Rumble

"School Rumble"s popularity has resulted in its adaptation into multiple forms of media. <a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a> broadcast a 26-episode <a href="anime">anime</a> program between October 2004 and April 2005. In December 2005, a two-part <a href="original%20video%20animation">original video animation</a> (OVA) entitled "School Rumble: Extra Class" was released. A second season, "School Rumble: 2nd Semester", aired between April and September 2006. Finally, two more episodes, collectively entitled "School Rumble: Third Semester", were bundled with the Japanese manga volumes 21 and 22. Three <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s have been produced—two for the in July 2005 and July 2006, and one for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> in 2005. Two light novels written by <a href="Hiroko%20Tokita">Hiroko Tokita</a> and illustrated by Kobayashi were published in April 2004 and December 2007; four official guidebooks illustrated by Kobayashi and written by his editors have also been released.

<a href="Del%20Rey%20Manga">Del Rey Manga</a> published the English translation of the first 16 volumes of "School Rumble" in physical format. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order to preserve <a href="pun">pun</a>s based on the characters' names. <a href="Kodansha%20USA">Kodansha USA</a> published the English translation in digital format. <a href="Funimation">Funimation</a> published the first and second anime seasons and the "Extra Class" OVAs in English. "School Rumble" has been translated into additional languages, although the final two episodes, the video games, and guidebooks have yet to be released outside Japan.

The manga was well received by Japanese-language readers; several volumes have appeared in the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered on some of the jokes and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and—for the English-language translation—critics. The decision by <a href="Media%20Factory">Media Factory</a> to aggressively pursue its <a href="Intellectual%20property">intellectual property rights</a> for "School Rumble" is believed by proponents of <a href="fansub">fansub</a>s to have had a negative impact on the franchise's release and sales in the North American market.

In 2009, Kobayashi said ""School Rumble" is an important piece that I want to draw more, but I wanted to do more other things so I ended it. When I have some time, I would like to draw their adult days in a <a href="Seinen%20manga">seinen magazine</a>."

"School Rumble" is a romantic "shōnen" comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> is <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Tenma">Tenma Tsukamoto</a>, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Oji%20Karasuma">Oji Karasuma</a>. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in <a href="curry">curry</a>. The main male protagonist, <a href="Juvenile%20delinquency">delinquent</a> <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Harima">Kenji Harima</a>, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.

Harima complicates the <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Eri%20Sawachika">Eri Sawachika</a>, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Yakumo">Yakumo Tsukamoto</a>, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Haruki%20Hanai">Haruki Hanai</a>, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared <a href="surname">surname</a> causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.

Although "School Rumble" focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Mikoto%20Suou">Mikoto Suo</a>, who runs a <a href="kenpo">kenpo</a> <a href="dojo">dojo</a> where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Akira%20Takano">Akira Takano</a>, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.

"School Rumble Z", the "parallel comedy", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23English%20exchange%20students">Max</a> or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.

<a href="Jin%20Kobayashi">Jin Kobayashi</a> began writing "School Rumble", his debut work, in 2002. He stated to an audience at <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>'s 2006 <a href="Kawaii%20Kon">Kawaii Kon</a> convention that he started writing the series because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting. Kobayashi's favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates "about 30%" of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that <a href="List%20of%20School%20Rumble%20characters%23Ryuuhei%20Suga">Ryuuhei Suga</a>, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical. Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates; Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he heard the <a href="Voice%20acting%20in%20Japan">voice actors</a>' interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound. He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes "if there's no misunderstanding then there's no funny story." He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.

Kobayashi and his editors collaborated on the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic illustrations for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish. As the series' <a href="Mangaka">manga artist</a>, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she should be on the cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six. Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of "School Rumble Z".

An anime adaptation of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi, and he was skeptical of the project when first approached. Negotiations and preparation took some time, but he claims to be happy with the end result. On viewing the first anime footage, Kobayashi was astonished; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time, stating "I was incredibly touched by it. Completely overcome." Impressed with the adaptation of his work, he praises the anime staff for their achievement, although conceding that "School Rumble" probably lent itself to the anime format. He cites the fishing episode, for which he supplied the voice acting for several minor parts, as his favorite.

Kobayashi allowed the voice actors who voiced his characters significant freedom to interpret them as they chose. There were a number of cast changes throughout the production; <a href="Ami%20Koshimizu">Ami Koshimizu</a>, the voice actress for Tenma, had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo, and between "School Rumble"s first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. <a href="Mako%20Sakurai">Mako Sakurai</a> took over Karen's role from <a href="Yuuka%20Nanri">Yuuka Nanri</a>, and <a href="Aya%20Hirano">Aya Hirano</a> replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.

The artbox design for <a href="Funimation">Funimation</a>'s <a href="DVD%20region%20code">North American</a> release of the "School Rumble" anime resembles a miniature metal locker, and each of the individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets. The discs include subtitled interviews with the Japanese voice actors, which were compiled onto a third DVD for the full first season release. In 2007, Funimation ran a drawing contest prior to releasing the anime in North America. The grand prize included a new computer with software for developing anime and manga. The <a href="DVD%20region%20code">United Kingdom</a> anime release by <a href="Revelation%20Films">Revelation Films</a> saw the same limited edition box as Funimation, along with two standard editions.

Jin Kobayashi wrote and illustrated both "School Rumble" and "School Rumble Z". "School Rumble" was serialized by <a href="Kodansha">Kodansha</a> in "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Magazine">Weekly Shōnen Magazine</a>" from October 2002 to July 2008. It further appeared in issues of "Shōnen Magazine"s "<a href="Magazine%20Special">Magazine Special</a>", and comprised one chapter of the seasonal . The collected works were released in Japan by Kodansha. "School Rumble Z" was produced in "Magazine Special" from August 2008 to May 2009. Concluding the series, a compiled volume was released on June 17, 2009. A special chapter of the manga was published on "Weekly Shōnen Magazine" on November 30, 2016.

As a guide to the contents of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In "School Rumble", chapters marked with a <a href="sharp%20%28music%29">sharp sign</a> (♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while <a href="side%20story">side stories</a> dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a <a href="flat%20%28music%29">flat sign</a> (♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in "Shōnen Magazine Wonder", which uses the <a href="natural%20sign">natural sign</a> (♮). "School Rumble Z" uses the natural sign for every chapter. The <a href="Bunkobon">manga volumes</a> of "School Rumble" contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.

<a href="Del%20Rey%20Manga">Del Rey Manga</a>, in North America, and <a href="Tanoshimi">Tanoshimi</a> in the United Kingdom licensed "School Rumble" for an English-language release. It has also been translated into other languages, although the German-language release which <a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a> initially published was cancelled and later continued by <a href="Egmont%20Manga%20%26amp%3B%20Anime">Egmont Manga & Anime</a>. Del Rey released the first English-language volume on February 28, 2006, and the latest—volumes 14-16 in an omnibus—on July 27, 2010. Following Kodansha's lead, the Del Rey translation places the main plot chapters first followed by the side stories. Del Rey also retained the Japanese naming order to preserve puns and humor involving the names of the characters. The manga ceased to be published in North America after Del Rey became defunct. Kodansha released 13 volumes of the manga digitally on iTunes on July 26, 2016. As of August 2017, all 22 volumes of the main series have been published digitally in English by Kodansha and can be purchased from typical ebook sites such as kobo.com and amazon.com.

<a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a> adapted the "School Rumble" manga for two 26-episode television <a href="sketch%20show">sketch show</a> series, and five additional episodes. The first season was broadcast in Japan from October 10, 2004 to March 29, 2005, followed by two <a href="original%20video%20animation">original video animation</a> (OVA) episodes entitled , which were released on December 22, 2005. The second season, , ran from April 2 to September 24, 2006.

Although a third series——was drawn up in the form of 24 episode synopses, the series was never animated. Instead a two-episode mini-series was released as episodes 25 and 26 of "School Rumble: Third Semester". The first 24 episodes follow the manga's storyline between the end of "School Rumble: 2nd Semester" and the "Third Semester" mini-series; the promotional videos of the mini-series on the anime's website instead of previews of a new season confirmed that the remaining 24 episodes would not be animated. The "School Rumble: Third Semester" episodes were released with special editions of volumes 21 and 22 of the "School Rumble" manga, the first on July 17 and the second on September 17, 2008.

"School Rumble", "School Rumble: 2nd Semester", and "School Rumble: Extra Class" were later licensed for an English-language audience by Funimation in North America, <a href="Madman%20Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a> in <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a> and the first three volumes of season one by Revelation Films in the United Kingdom. On September 1, 2009 Funimation re-released "School Rumble: First Semester" and "Extra class" as a compilation. "2nd Semester" was re-released as an entire season with a new rating of <a href="TV-MA">TV-MA</a>. The anime has also been released in other languages, and Funimation have made several <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dub</a>bed episodes of "School Rumble" and "School Rumble: 2nd Semester" available as <a href="Stream%20%28computing%29">streaming content</a> on the Internet. The <a href="Funimation%20Channel">Funimation Channel</a> began airing the first season of "School Rumble" on September 1, 2008."School Rumble: 2nd Semester" and the "Extra Class" OVA has also aired on the <a href="Funimation%20Channel">Funimation Channel</a>. The 2008's Future Film Festival in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, Italy screened "School Rumble: 2nd Semester".

The anime's first season focuses on Tenma, Harima, and Karasuma, and Harima's relationships with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The "Extra Class" OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the "Third Semester" synopses and episodes return to the main cast. The anime's structure has been compared to "<a href="Azumanga%20Daioh">Azumanga Daioh</a>", with thematic influences from "<a href="Full%20Metal%20Panic%3F%20Fumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a>". In places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature; the title of episode 25 of season one is a set of <a href="pictogram">pictogram</a>s, while episode 26's title has 187 characters in the Japanese original. In season two, the Japanese title for episode 26 consists of just a <a href="Full%20stop">period</a>.
The narrative of the "School Rumble" anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown from the perspective of its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode 1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with "<a href="Initial%20D">Initial D</a>" will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with "Initial D"s famous AE86 has a bit more <a href="wikt%3Acachet">cachet</a> when you know why there's a cheesily <a href="computer%20graphics">rendered</a> race car in slow moving <a href="Eurobeat">Eurobeat</a>."

Two <a href="anime%20soundtrack">anime soundtrack</a>s and five <a href="maxi%20single">maxi single</a> albums based on the anime's opening and closing themes have been released, with all but the second season's closing theme having both a regular and limited edition. In addition, three two-disc drama CDs and three radio dramas have been released on CD. Eight <a href="Image%20song">image albums</a>—one for each of the main characters—have also been released, in both a regular and limited edition run.

On December 5, 2004, Yokohama BLITZ held a concert entitled , featuring the voice acting cast of "School Rumble". The event was released on DVD on March 24, 2005. Announced around the time of the Japanese release of volume 15, from July 21 through July 25, 2005 a stage play called recapping Season 1 of "School Rumble" was performed. It was released on DVD on October 10, 2005. Unicorn Table, the soundtrack artists for "School Rumble", performed songs from the anime from December 7–9, 2007 at the <a href="New%20York%20Anime%20Festival">New York Anime Festival</a>, and again on April 26, 2008 at the <a href="Rochester%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a> for the Tora-Con <a href="anime%20convention">anime convention</a>.

Three video games based on "School Rumble" have been developed and released in Japan. <a href="Marvelous%20Entertainment">Marvelous Entertainment</a> published the first game for the entitled on July 21, 2005. It was later reissued on August 10, 2006, as a "<a href="The%20Best%20%28PlayStation%20range%29">The Best</a>" range budget release. Marvelous Entertainment released a second game, entitled on July 20, 2006, also for the PlayStation 2. The story revolves around the "School Rumble" cast hearing a rumor of treasure hidden within a mansion. Two versions were produced; a regular and a limited edition, the latter of which included a <a href="drama%20CD">drama CD</a>, memorial album, and a special box with variant cover art. On June 28, 2007, this game was also re-released as a "Best Collection". , published on July 7, 2005 for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> by <a href="Bandai">Bandai</a>. It has an original story based around Karasuma suffering a sudden collapse. Although the story centers on Tenma, the player can take the perspective of other characters to obtain clues for solving the mystery.

"School Rumble" has been the basis of two light novels and four guidebooks. The light novels, and , were written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi and published in April 2004 and December 2007 respectively. They were later translated by <a href="Tong%20Li%20Comics">Tong Li Comics</a> into <a href="Traditional%20Chinese">Traditional Chinese</a>. Jin Kobayashi and his editors also wrote and illustrated four official guidebooks for the series: "School Rumble: Private File", "School Rumble: Official File", "School Rumble: Pleasure File", and "School Rumble: Treasure File".

"School Rumble" has spawned lots of merchandise featuring its characters, including T-shirts and figurines.

In 2004, "School Rumble"s Japanese license holder, Media Factory, declared its titles off-limits to fan-made subtitled translations—a practice known as <a href="fansub">fansub</a>bing. The directory website <a href="AnimeSuki">AnimeSuki</a> later removed all links to fansubs of Media Factory's work in response to a <a href="cease-and-desist">cease-and-desist</a> notice issued by the license holder, although fansub group 'Wannabe Fansubs' continued their fansubbing regardless. Media Factory-owned anime has been the subject of debate over the validity of fansubbing practice. Proponents believe "School Rumble" would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate more freely, generating viewer interest.

On January 19, 2012, the Taiwanese children's channel Momo Kids TV was reported to have received a fine of NT$600,000 (about $20,333 in U.S. currency) for broadcasting an episode of "School Rumble" on December 26, which according to parental complaints contained "high school students watching a pornographic movie together", along with "a scene of jiggling breasts" and "actors moaning in pornographic movies." However, it is worth noting that the show has aired on various international <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> stations without controversy.

The "School Rumble" manga had a successful sales run in Japan and the North American English market. In Japan, several volumes managed to chart: Volume 13 was the ninth best-selling manga for the week of June 21, 2006, before falling to tenth the following week; Volume 15 reached 4th place for the week of December 20, also falling to 10th the following week; and Volume 17 came 7th for the week of June 20, 2007, subsequently dropping to 9th. "School Rumble Z" ranked 18th for the week of June 15, 2009. Del Rey's North American translation sold well, although not quite as well as in Japan. Volume 3 was ranked 99th in September 2006; volume 4 was 96th in December; volume 5 was 98th in April 2007; volume 12 was 141st in November 2008; and volume 12 was 169th in May 2009. Overall the series ranked as the 145th best-selling English translated manga series for 2008.

Similarly, the anime adaptation of "School Rumble" also sold very well in Japan according to the <a href="Oricon">Oricon</a> charts. The Japanese DVD release of "First Semester" saw fluctuating sales for each volume with each charting within the top 45. have the best showings at five times at 15 and twice at 17 respectively, while the final three were the least successful with volume 8 being the lowest ranking twice at 45. While the "2nd Semester" continued to sell well, overall sales did not chart as well as the previous season. Most of the DVDs ranked in the range from 50s to 70s and all of them ranked just twice. Volume 1 ranked the best at 41, followed by volume 4 at 49; volume 6 ranked lowest at 100.
The "Extra Class" OVA also ranked once at 66.

The DVD of the voice actor's live performance, "come! come! well-come Party", ranked once at 177 on Oricon charts.

Although generally well-received, the manga has also attracted some criticism. Eduardo M. Chavez, of Mania.com, recalls being initially put off by the title, which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional. After glancing through the first volume, he was surprised to find his assumption wrong, and concluded that it was appropriately named. While he gives a largely positive review, Chavez finds the series' artwork "simple" and unimpressive. He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi's ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the manga artist for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing "School Rumble" from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the "flat" chapters dealing with Yakumo. In the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters "grow up", although acknowledging that while the manga's style suits his personal preferences it will not be to everyone's taste. <a href="Jason%20Thompson%20%28writer%29">Jason Thompson</a> in "" criticises jokes as "predictable" and gives the manga 2 stars of 5.

Sakura Eries, also of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, and eight to eleven positive ratings overall. She noted that volume five may appeal to readers more interested in the side characters, and that appreciating Kobayashi's humor in the second half of chapter eight "requires a bit more mental effort". In volume ten, she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used cliché of a disastrous school play, he manages to add enough twists to make it unique. The play's climax, however, confused her more than it amused her.

Carlo Santos, of <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a>, gave the English releases of volumes two, three, four, and seven mixed—but largely favorable—B-range reviews. Volume nine he awards a C rating. He approved of the character of Harima, particularly enjoying jokes comparing him to <a href="St.%20Francis%20of%20Assisi">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Santos found the bonus chapters in volumes three and four, that deal with Yakumo, touching. On the other hand, he criticizes various aspects of the artwork and, by volume seven, laments the staleness of recycled jokes. Despite volume nine's strong start, by its end he relates that, although there were some funny moments, he had become weary of its repetitive plot. A fellow reviewer from Anime News Network, Carl Kimlinger, decided after reviewing four volumes that while the early volumes do not assist plot development, neither do they detract from the manga's appeal; he too had a positive impression overall. Kimlinger found the later volumes better and more entertaining, although not always during the romantic moments.

Chavez praised Del Rey's translation for retaining the manga's original identity; the header, bumper artwork, character biographies, and front covers are all but identical to the Japanese. Eries also thanked Del Rey's translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her, although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.

Like the manga, the anime has been well received but does not avoid criticism; in particular the quality of the animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes:

Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer, but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.

While "School Rumble" is generally recognised as a <a href="sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen</a> title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for <a href="About.com">About.com</a>, refers to it as a <a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">shōjo</a> title aimed at girls and young women. Lisa Marie, reviewer for <a href="RightStuf">RightStuf</a>'s "Anime Today" <a href="podcast">podcast</a>, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD "the perfect back-to-school accessory", while Marie characterizes "School Rumble" as "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like "<a href="Excel%20Saga">Excel Saga</a>" and "<a href="Har%C3%A9%20%2B%20Guu">Haré + Guu</a>". However, it uses its "cast to break...every rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [that] it takes you a moment to realize what just happened doesn't make any sense." A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its <a href="surreal%20humour">surreal humour</a>, and for being "anime newbie friendly" in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin—such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars "'<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>"—giving the series broad appeal.

Anime News Network's reviewers found much to enjoy about the first series, although Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle too much of it in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times", and that the title is "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that "although this disc technically marks the end of [the first season of] "School Rumble", it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for "School Rumble"s English translation of the first season was welcomed.

According to Theron Martin, the OVA series "School Rumble: Extra Class" was made mostly for devoted fans; claiming that familiarity with the series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came to the view that it may also be useful as a sampler of the series. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that "make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker". However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive. Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to "School Rumble", due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.

Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post commentary on the preview announcement for the second season, claiming "we assume if you loved "School Rumble", you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?" David F. Smith from IGN gave the first part of season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for <a href="sight%20gag">sight gag</a>s—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.

Lat

<a href="Malay%20styles%20and%20titles%23Datuk">Datuk</a> Mohammad Nor bin Mohammad Khalid (<a href="Jawi%20script">Jawi</a>: محمد نور بن محمد خالد; born 5 March 1951), more commonly known as Lat, is a Malaysian cartoonist. Winner of the <a href="Fukuoka%20Asian%20Culture%20Prize">Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize</a> in 2002, Lat has published more than 20 volumes of cartoons since he was 13 years old. His works mostly illustrate Malaysia's social and political scenes, portraying them in a comedic light without bias. Lat's best known work is "<a href="The%20Kampung%20Boy">The Kampung Boy</a>" (1979), which is published in several countries across the world. In 1994, the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Perak">Sultan of Perak</a> bestowed the honorific title of "<a href="Malay%20styles%20and%20titles%23Dato%27">datuk</a>" on Lat, in recognition of the cartoonist's work in helping to promote social harmony and understanding through his cartoons. Lat also works for the government to improve trance genre, and to improve the city’s social security.

Born in a village, Lat spent his youth in the countryside before moving to the city at the age of 11. While in school, he supplemented his family's income by contributing cartoon strips to newspapers and magazines. He was 13 years old when he achieved his first published comic book, "Tiga Sekawan" ("Three Friends Catch a Thief"). After failing to attain the grades that were required to continue education beyond high school, Lat became a newspaper reporter. In 1974, he switched careers to be an <a href="editorial%20cartoonist">editorial cartoonist</a>. His works, reflecting his view about Malaysian life and the world, are staple features in national newspapers such as "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>" and "<a href="Berita%20Harian">Berita Minggu</a>". He adapted his life experiences and published them as his autobiographies, "The Kampung Boy" and "Town Boy", telling stories of rural and urban life with comparisons between the two.

Lat's style has been described as reflective of his early influences, "<a href="The%20Beano">The Beano</a>" and "<a href="The%20Dandy">The Dandy</a>". He has, however, come into his own way of illustration, drawing the common man on the streets with bold strokes in pen and ink. A trademark of his Malay characters is their three-loop noses. Lat paid attention to family life and children because of his idolisation of Raja Hamzah, a senior cartoonist who was also popular in the 1960s with his comics about swashbuckling heroes. <a href="Rejabhad">Rejabhad</a>, a well-respected cartoonist, was Lat's mentor, and imbued the junior cartoonist with a preference to be sensitive to the subjects of his works. Lat's attention to details gained him popularity, endearing his works to the masses who find them believable and unbiased.

Aside from writing and publishing cartoons, Lat has ventured into the fields of animation, merchandising, and theme parks with his creations. His name and works are recognised internationally; foreign cartoonists, such as <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> and <a href="Sergio%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Sergio Aragonés</a>, admire his art, and foreign governments invite Lat to tour their countries, hoping to gain greater exposure for their countries through Lat's cartoons of his experiences in them. After 27 years of living and working in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, Lat moved back to <a href="Ipoh">Ipoh</a> for a more sedate lifestyle in semi-retirement.

Mohammad Nor Khalid was born on 5 March 1951 in a "<a href="Village%23Brunei%2C%20Indonesia%20and%20Malaysia">kampung</a>" (village) in <a href="Gopeng">Gopeng</a>, Perak, Malaysia. His father was a government clerk with the <a href="Malaysian%20Armed%20Forces">Malaysian Armed Forces</a>, and his mother a housewife. Khalid was a stocky boy with a cherubic face, which led his family to nickname him "bulat" (round). His friends shortened it to "Lat"; it became the name by which he was more commonly known in his "kampung" and later in the world. Lat was the eldest child in his family, and he often played in the jungles, plantations, and tin mines with his friends. Their toys were usually improvised from everyday sundries and items of nature. Lat liked to doodle with materials provided by his parents, and his other forms of recreation were reading comics and watching television; Lat idolised local cartoonist Raja Hamzah, who was popular with his tales of swashbuckling Malay heroes. Malaysian art critic and historian <a href="Redza%20Piyadasa">Redza Piyadasa</a> believes Lat's early years in the "kampung" ingrained the cartoonist with pride in his "kampung" roots and a "peculiarly Malay" outlook—"full of [...] gentleness and refinement".

Lat's formal education began at a local Malay "kampung(village)" school; these institutions often taught in the vernacular and did not aspire to academic attainment. The boy changed schools several times; the nature of his father's job moved the family from one military base to another across the country, until they settled back at his birthplace in 1960. A year later, Lat passed the Special Malay Class Examination, qualifying him to attend an English medium boarding school—National Type Primary School—in the state's capital, <a href="Ipoh">Ipoh</a>. His achievement helped his father make the decision to sell their "kampung" estate and move the family to the town; society in those days considered education at an English medium school a springboard to a good future. Lat continued his education at Anderson School, Perak's "premier non-missionary English medium school". Redza highlights Lat's move to Ipoh for higher schooling as a significant point in the cartoonist's development; the multi-racial environment helped establish his diverse friendships, which in turn broadened his cultural perspectives.

At the age of nine, Lat began to supplement his family's income through his artistic skills, by drawing comics and selling them to his friends. Four years later, in 1964, the young cartoonist achieved his first published work: a local movie magazine—"Majallah Filem"—printed his comic strips, paying him with movie tickets. Lat's first comic book publication, "Tiga Sekawan" ("Three Friends Catch a Thief"), was published by Sinaran Brothers that year. The company had accepted Lat's submission, mistaking him for an adult and paying him 25 <a href="Malaysian%20ringgit">Malaysian ringgit</a>s (RM) for a story about three friends who band together to catch thieves. In 1968, at the age of 17, Lat started penning "Keluarga Si Mamat" ("Mamats Family"), a comic strip for "<a href="Berita%20Harian">Berita Minggu</a>" (the Sunday edition of "Berita Harian"). The series ran in the paper every week for 26 years. Although still a schoolboy, Lat was earning a monthly income of RM100, a large sum in those days, from his cartoons. His education finished two years later at the end of Form 5; his Third Grade in the <a href="Senior%20Cambridge">Senior Cambridge</a> examinations was not enough for him to advance to Form 6. Graduating with an education equivalent to that of high school, Lat started looking for a job and had his sights set on becoming an illustrator.

Moving to the Malaysian capital <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, Lat applied for a cartoonist's position at "Berita Harian". He was told there was no vacancy, but the paper's editor, <a href="Abdul%20Samad%20Ismail">Abdul Samad Ismail</a>, offered him the post of a crime reporter. Lat accepted, a decision he explained was borne from necessity rather than choice: "It was a question of survival. I had to earn money to help support the family." At that time, Lat's father had fallen seriously ill and could not work; Lat had to become the breadwinner of his family. Aside from taking the job, he continued contributing cartoons to other publications. Lat was later transferred to "Berita"s parent publication, "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>". Moving throughout the city to report on crimes gave Lat opportunities to observe and interact with the myriads of lives in the urban landscape, enabling him to gather material for his cartoons and increasing his understanding of the world. Nevertheless, he felt he lacked the persistently inquisitive nature needed to succeed as a crime reporter. Furthermore, his "breathtakingly detailed, lurid and graphically gory descriptions" of the aftermaths of crimes had to be frequently toned down by his seniors. Lat became convinced that he was a failure at his job, and his despondency led him to tender his resignation. Samad, believing Lat had a bright future with the press, furiously rejected the letter.

Lat's career took a turn for the better on 10 February 1974; "Asia Magazine", a periodical based in Hong Kong, published his cartoons about "Bersunat"—a <a href="Khitan%20%28circumcision%29">circumcision ceremony</a> all Malaysian boys of the <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic faith have to undergo. The cartoons impressed Tan Sri Lee Siew Yee, editor-in-chief of the "New Straits Times". Lee found Lat's portrayal of the important ceremony humorous yet sensitive, and grumbled that the newspaper should have hired the artist. He was surprised to be told that Lat was already working within his organisation. Lat was called to Lee's office to have a talk, which raised the reporter's profile in the company. He became the paper's column cartoonist, taking up a position created for him by Samad, now deputy editor of the "New Straits Times". His first duty was to document Malaysian culture in a series of cartoons titled "<a href="Scenes%20of%20Malaysian%20Life">Scenes of Malaysian Life</a>". The newspaper also sent him to study for four months at <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins%20College%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">St Martin's School of Art</a> in London, where he was introduced to English <a href="editorial%20cartoon">editorial cartoon</a>s and newspapers. Returning to Malaysia full of fascination with his experience, Lat transformed "Scenes of Malaysian Life" into a series of editorial cartoons. His approach proved popular, and at the end of 1975 he was appointed full-time cartoonist with total freedom in his work.

Lat produced a steady stream of editorial cartoons that entertained Malaysian society. By 1978, two collections of his works ("Lots of Lat" and "Lat's Lot") had been compiled and sold to the public. Although Malaysians knew of Lat through "Scenes of Malaysian Life", it was his next work that propelled him into national consciousness and international recognition. In 1979, Berita Publishing Sendirian Berhad published Lat's "<a href="The%20Kampung%20Boy">The Kampung Boy</a>", an autobiographical cartoon account of his youth. The book was a commercial hit; according to Lat, the first printing—60,000 to 70,000 copies—sold out within four months of the book's release. Readers of the book were captivated by his "heart-warming" portrayal of Malaysian rural life, rendered with "scribbly black-and-white sketches" and accompanied by "simple but eloquent prose". By 2009, the book has been reprinted 16 times and published in several other countries in various languages, including Portuguese, French, and Japanese. The success of "The Kampung Boy" established Lat as the "most renowned cartoonist in Malaysia."

In 1981, "Town Boy" was published. It continued "The Kampung Boy"s story, telling of the protagonist's teenage life in an urban setting. Two more compilations of Lat's editorial cartoons ("With a Little Bit of Lat" and "Lots More Lat") were published and the number of people who recognised him continued to grow. In 1984, partly from a desire to step away from the limelight, Lat resigned from the "New Straits Times" to become a freelancer, but continued to draw "Scenes of Malaysia Life" for the newspaper. He set up his own company, Kampung Boy Sendirian Berhad (Village Boy <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">private limited</a>), to oversee the merchandising of his cartoon characters and publishing of his books. In 2009, Kampung Boy partnered <a href="Sanrio">Sanrio</a> and <a href="Hit%20Entertainment">Hit Entertainment</a> in a project to open an indoor theme park which would later be called as "Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park" in <a href="Nusajaya">Nusajaya</a>, Johor in August 2012. One of the park's attractions will be the sight of performers dressed up as "Kampung Boy" characters beside those in <a href="Hello%20Kitty">Hello Kitty</a> and <a href="Bob%20the%20Builder">Bob the Builder</a> costumes and also reported in August 2012 will be a Lat-inspired diner called "Lat's Place". It will be designed in a Malaysian village setting, coupled with animations for patrons to interact with.

Lat has experimented with media other than paper. In 1993 he produced a short animated feature, "Mina Smiles", for <a href="Unesco">Unesco</a>; the video, featuring a female lead, was for a literacy campaign. Personal concerns motivated Lat for his next foray into animation; judging that Western animation of the 1980s and 90s had negative influences, he wanted to produce a series for Malaysian children that espoused local values. The result was "<a href="Kampung%20Boy%20%28TV%20series%29">Kampung Boy</a>" the television series (1997), an adaptation of his trademark comic. The 26-episode series received positive reviews for technical details and content. There were comments on its similarities to "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", and on its English which was not entirely local. His most recent involvement with animation was in 2009; "Lat's Window to the World", a <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical animated feature</a>, played at the <a href="Dewan%20Filharmonik%20Petronas">Petronas Philharmonic Hall</a>. Lat had been commissioned to help create three animated vignettes based on "The Kampung Boy" to accompany the instruments of the <a href="Malaysian%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The scores, composed by <a href="Carl%20Davis">Carl Davis</a>, complemented Lat's visuals, capturing the spirit of "kampung" childhood in a "simple, idyllic past".

In 1997, after 27 years of living in Kuala Lumpur, Lat moved back to Ipoh with his family. Aside from retreating slightly from the cartooning scene, he wanted to be close to his old "kampung" and let his children experience life in a small town or village; he had married in 1977, and the couple have four children—two daughters and two sons. Lat said that raising his children has helped him cope with the pressures of his fame and made him realise that he might be losing touch with the new generation of Malaysians who have different tastes in cartoons. His wife helps him in his work, scanning his completed cartoons and emailing them to the newspaper offices in Kuala Lumpur. Lat still draws with his usual pens and inks, avoiding the use of computers except to read his emails. In 2011–12, he is to join other artists from around the world in Italy for the Civitella Ranieri Fellowship programme. During their one-month stay, they are encouraged to share ideas in an environment fostered to stimulate their creativity.

Lat covers various genres in his works. His portfolio is diverse; John A. Lent, a scholar of Asian cartoons, found it to difficult to classify the cartoonist into any particular field. In his "Keluarga Si Mamat" series, Lat drew slapsticks and satires that examined the encounters between traditional and modern values. Humorous stories of children at play also populated the series. Jennifer Rodrigo Willmott, writer for "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>", stated that: 
Using a large cast of characters—a wide assortment of personalities and cultures—allows Lat to comment on a wider range of topics than is possible with a small group of characters. Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat's cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; "short, compact dialogues" and puns form the text while "facial expressions and actions" of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. Muliyadi further stated that Lat's works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader would laugh at Lat's cartoon for its slapstick, while another would find the same work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. As an example, Muliyadi referred to a "Keluarga Si Mamat" strip published in 1972. Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified physical education teachers then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher's plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government's failure to prevent the situation from happening.

The narration of Lat's early cartoons, such as "Tiga Sekawan" and "Keluarga Si Mamat", was in Malay. His later works, however, were mostly in English; "Scenes of Malaysian Life" ran only in the English-language "New Straits Times". The English idiom in his works reflects the local <a href="pidgin">pidgin</a> form—"<a href="Manglish">Malglish</a>"—containing smatterings of Malay words and a simpler grammatical structure. After a string of successful English publications, Lat worried he had neglected Malaysians who were not proficient in English. He drew "Mat Som", a story of a "kampung" boy who moved to the city to work as a writer and courted a pretty city girl. The comic was in Malay and a commercial hit; its first print of 30,000 copies sold out in three months. "<a href="Far%20Eastern%20Economic%20Review">Far Eastern Economic Review</a>" journalist Suhaini Aznam remarked that Lat's strength was his ability to portray the plight of the common man in a satiric light without any form of bias.

Lat's artistic skills were cultivated from youth and self-taught. The cartoonist believes he inherited the talent and interest from his father, who doodled as a hobby and was notorious for his sense of humour as the "village jester". Lat says his siblings were also gifted in drawing, but they never bothered to develop their talents. His parents actively encouraged him to develop his artistic skills, although his father occasionally told him not to make a career of it. He also received encouragement from outside his family; Lat's primary school teacher Mrs Moira Hew (the inspiration for one of his characters, the Butterfly-Glassed Lady), helped nurture his gift, frequently asking him to illustrate lessons in class. Her teachings expanded Lat's mind and made him more receptive to ideas that looked beyond his "kampung".
The early influences on his art style were from the West. Like most of the Malaysian children in the 1950s, Lat watched <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoons ("<a href="The%20Flintstones">The Flintstones</a>" and "<a href="The%20Jetsons">The Jetsons</a>") on television and read imported British comics, such as "<a href="The%20Dandy">The Dandy</a>" and "<a href="The%20Beano">The Beano</a>". He studied them and used their styles and themes in his early doodles. After the foreign influences in his works were noticed by a family friend, Lat was advised by his father to observe and draw upon ideas from their surroundings instead. Heeding the advice, the young cartoonist intimated himself with local happenings. "Tiga Sekawan" was conceived as a humorous crime-fighting story of a local flavour. "Keluarga Si Mamat" and its protagonist were named after his youngest brother <a href="Mamat%20Khalid">Mamat</a>, its stories based on Lat's observations of his fellow villagers and schoolmates. The inspiration for his cartoons about "Bersunat" came about when he was on assignment at a hospital. As he was taking breaks from investigating the dead victims of crime brought to the morgue, Lat chanced upon the circumcisions performed by the hospital on ethnic Malay boys. He found their experiences clinical, devoid of the elaborate and personal ceremonies that celebrated his own rite to manhood in the village. Lat felt compelled to illustrate the differences between life in his "kampung" and the city.

When Lat formally entered the cartooning industry, he was not totally unfamiliar with the profession. He had the benefit of the mentorship of <a href="Rejabhad">Rejabhad</a>, an experienced political cartoonist. Rejabhad was well respected by his countrymen, who titled him the ""penghulu" (chief) of Malay cartoonists". After noticing Lat's submissions to newspapers and magazines, he corresponded with the young cartoonist. When Rejabhad was requested by Lat's mother to take care of her 15-year-old son in the cartooning industry, he accepted. He gave advice and influenced Lat's growth as a cartoonist. Lat treated Rejabhad with great respect, holding up his mentor as a role model. The affection and admiration was mutual. Thirty-six years after taking Lat under his wing, Rejabhad recounted their relationship in these words:
Rejabhad was not the first local figure to have exerted an influence on Lat. Raja Hamzah, popular with his action comics and ghost stories, was Lat's "hero" in his childhood. It was Raja Hamzah's cartoons of local swashbuckling adventurers that inspired Lat to become a cartoonist. "Tiga Sekawan" was the culmination of that desire, the success after numerous failed submissions and an affirmation to Lat that he could become a cartoonist like his idol. Raja Hamzah also had success with comic strips on family life, such as "Mat Jambul's Family" and "Dol Keropok and Wak Tempeh". These cartoons imbued Lat with a fascination of family life and the antics of children, which served him well in his later works. Lat was interested in studying the details of his surroundings and capturing them in his works. "Keluarga Si Mamat" and "The Kampung Boy" faithfully depicted their characters' appearances and attitudes. Their narrations were written in a style that was natural to the locals. Thus, Lat was able to make his readers believe his stories and characters were substantially "Malay".

After his study trip to London in 1975, Lat's works exhibited the influences of editorial cartoonists such as <a href="Frank%20Dickens">Frank Dickens</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Steadman">Ralph Steadman</a>, and <a href="Gerald%20Scarfe">Gerald Scarfe</a>. In 1997, Ron Provencher, a professor <a href="%3Awikt%3Aemeritus">emeritus</a> at Northern Illinois University, reported that Lat's style reminded his informants on the Malaysian cartooning scene of "The Beano". Muliyadi elaborated that "The Beano" and "The Dandy"s "theme of a child's world" is evident in Lat's "Keluarga Si Mamat". Others commented that Lat's art stood out on its own. Singaporean cartoonist <a href="Morgan%20Chua">Morgan Chua</a> believed that Lat "managed to create an impressively local style while remaining original", and although comics historian Isao Shimizu found Lat's lines "somewhat crude", he noted that the cartoonist's work was "highly original" and "full of life". Redza's judgement was that "The Beano" and "The Dandy" were "early formative [influences]" on Lat before he came into his own style. Lent gave his assessment in 1999:
Lat's work with pen and ink so impressed <a href="Larry%20Gonick">Larry Gonick</a> that the American cartoonist was tempted into experimenting with this medium for part of his "<a href="The%20Cartoon%20History%20of%20the%20Universe">The Cartoon History of the Universe</a>". Gonick tried to use the medium as he did his regular brushes; however, the results proved unsatisfactory. Lat occasionally colours his works, such as those in his "Kampong Boy: Yesterday and Today" (1993), using watercolour or <a href="marker%20pen">marker pen</a>s. According to Lent, Redza judged that Lat had "elevated cartooning to the level of 'high visual arts' through his social commentary and 'construction of the landscape'". The art critic was not alone in having a high regard for Lat's works. Jaafar Taib, cartoonist and editor of Malaysian satirical magazine "Gila-Gila", found Lat's cartoons retained their humour and relevance throughout time. He explained that this quality arose from the well-thought-out composition of Lat's works, which helped to clearly express the ideas behind the cartoons.

At the time that Lat started drawing for the "New Straits Times", local political cartoonists were gentle in their treatment of Malaysian politicians; the politicians' features were recreated faithfully and criticisms were voiced in the form of subtle poems. Lat, however, pushed the boundaries; although he portrayed the politicians with dignity, he exaggerated notable features of their appearances and traits. Lat recalled that in 1974, he was told to change one of his works, which portrayed Malaysian Prime Minister <a href="Tun%20Abdul%20Razak">Abdul Razak</a> from the back. Lee refused to print the work unchanged, and pointedly asked the cartoonist "You want to go to jail?!" In 1975, however, Lat's next attempt at a political cartoon won Lee's approval. The satire featured a caricature of Razak's successor—<a href="Hussein%20Onn">Hussein Onn</a>—on the back of a camel, travelling back to Kuala Lumpur from Saudi Arabia; its punchline was Hussein's hailing of his mount to slow down after reading news that a pay raise for the civil service would be enacted on his return.

Malaysia's political class grew comfortable with Lat's caricatures, and like the rest of the country, found them entertaining. Muliyadi described Lat's style as "subtle, indirect, and symbolic", following traditional forms of Malaysian humour in terms of ethics and aesthetics. The cartoonist's compliance with tradition in his art earned him the country's respect. When Lat was critical of politicians, he portrayed them in situations "unusual, abnormal or unexpected" to their status or personalities, using the contrast to make the piece humorous. <a href="Mahathir%20bin%20Mohamad">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a>, Malaysia's fourth Prime Minister, was Lat's frequent target for much of his political career, providing more than 20 years worth of material to the cartoonist—enough for a 146-page compilation "Dr Who?!" (2004). Lat's political wit targeted not only local politicians, but also Israeli actions in the Middle East and foreign figures such as prominent Singaporean politician <a href="Lee%20Kwan%20Yew">Lee Kwan Yew</a>. Despite his many works of political nature, Lat does not consider himself a political cartoonist and openly admits that there are others better than he is in this field.

Lat prefers to portray his ideas with as little antagonism as possible. He heeds the advice of his mentor, Rejabhad, and is aware of sensitivities, especially those of race, culture, and religion. As he devises the concept for his cartoon, he eliminates anything he believes to be malicious or insensitive. At the Fourth Asian Cartoon Exhibition in Tokyo, Lat revealed that when it came to making religious comments in his work, he only did so on his own religion (Islam). In such cases, Lat uses his art to help educate the young about his faith. Lat trusts his editors to do their jobs and cull what is socially unacceptable for print. In an interview, he revealed his discomfort with the concept of self-publishing, believing that unadulterated or unsupervised cartoon drawing could lead to "rubbish". He prefers to be assertive in areas with which he is comfortable or competent. Lat is adamant on not changing what he has already drawn; several pieces of his cartoons remain unpublished because editors refused to print them unchanged. When that happens, the editors spike (blank) the space for his regular cartoon in the newspaper. Lat admitted of his unprinted works: "Okay, maybe I've pushed the line a little bit, but I've never got into trouble and, frankly, only a handful of my cartoons were ever spiked."

Music has played a crucial part in Lat's life since his youth; he revealed in an interview that listening to songs such as <a href="Peggy%20March">Peggy March</a>'s "<a href="I%20Will%20Follow%20Him">I Will Follow Him</a>" and <a href="Paul%20%26amp%3B%20Paula">Paul & Paula</a>'s "<a href="Hey%20Paula%20%28song%29">Hey Paula</a>" helped him learn English. Listening to music had also become an important ritual in his work, providing him with inspiration in his art. When he sketches "fashionable girls", he puts on <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s tracks, and switches to Indonesian <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> when he needs to draw intricate details. He enjoys pop music, particularly rock music of the 1950s and 60s, listening to <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, and <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. Lat is also partial to country music, and to singers such as <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a> and <a href="Roy%20Rogers">Roy Rogers</a> because he finds their tunes "humble". His enjoyment of music is more than a passive interest; he is proficient with the guitar and piano, and can play them by ear.

Malaysian society used to look down on cartoonists, assuming that those who practised the trade were intellectually inferior to writers, or were lesser artists; Lat was not the only cartoonist to be paid with movie tickets in the 1950s; Rejabhad once received one ticket for ten cartoons, and many others were likewise recompensed, or were paid very little money. Despite the lowly reputation of his profession at that time, Lat is very proud of his choice of career; he once took umbrage with an acquaintance's girlfriend for her presumption that the words and ideas in his cartoons were not his own. Drawing cartoons is more than a career to him:
The elongated "L" in Lat's signature was born from his joy in completing a work. He professes that his primary aim in drawing cartoons is to make people laugh; his role as a cartoonist is "to translate the reaction of the people into humorous cartoons". He has no intentions to preach his beliefs through his art, believing that people should be free to make up their own minds and that the best he can do is to make readers ponder the deeper meanings behind a humorous scene. The reward he has sought from drawing since his youth is simple:
Lat's pride in cartooning pushed him to promote the art as a respectable career. In 1991, he banded together with fellow cartoonists Zunar, Rejabhad, and Muliyadi to start "Pekartun" (Persatuan Kartunis Selangor dan Kuala Lumpur). This association holds exhibitions and forums, to raise public awareness of cartooning and to build relationships among its members. It also helps to clarify legal issues such as copyrights to its members, and acts as an intermediary between them and the government. In the previous year, Lat's company, Kampung Boy, had organised the first Malaysian International Cartoonists Gathering, bringing together cartoonists from several countries across the world to exhibit their art and participate in conferences to educate others in their work. In Redza's opinion, Lat played a great role in making cartooning respectable among his fellow Malaysians.

Aside from promoting the rights of fellow cartoonists, Lat developed an interest in encouraging conservation of the natural environment. Several of his works caricature the consequences of pollution and over-exploitation of resources. Invited to give a speech at the 9th Osaka International Symposium on Civilisation in 1988, Lat talked about the environmental problems associated with overpopulation and heavy industrialisation. He further reminisced about the simple cleaner life he had enjoyed as a child in the "kampung". In 1977, when a protest was organised against logging activities in the <a href="Endau%20Rompin%20National%20Park">Endau-Rompin Reserves</a>, Lat helped gain support for the movement by drawing cartoons in the newspapers that highlighted the issue. Lat is also particularly concerned over what he sees as the negative side of urban development. He believes that such developments have contributed to the loss of the traditional way of life; people forget the old culture and values as they ingratiate themselves with the rapid pace and sophistication of urban lifestyles. His defence and fondness of the old ways are manifested in his "The Kampung Boy", "Town Boy", "Mat Som", and "Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today", which champion the old lifestyles as spiritually superior.

Recognised globally, and widely popular in his country, Lat has been styled "cultural hero", "his nation's conscience in cartoon form" and "Malaysian icon" among other effusive titles. The Malaysian Press Institute felt Lat had "become an institution in [his] own right", honouring him with their Special Jury Award in 2005. Cartoonists in the Southeast Asian region, such as Muliyadi, Chua, and Rejabhad, have given high praise to Lat, and his admirers further abroad include North American cartoonists <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Campbell">Eddie Campbell</a>. Groening, creator of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", gave a testimonial for the United States version of "The Kampung Boy", praising Lat's signature work as "one of the all-time great cartoon books". <a href="Sergio%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Sergio Aragonés</a>, the creator of "<a href="Groo%20the%20Wanderer">Groo the Wanderer</a>", is another of Lat's American fans. After visiting Malaysia in 1987, Aragonés used the experience to create a story for Groo in which the bumbling swordsman chances on the isle of Felicidad, whose inhabitants and natural habitat were modelled after those of the Southeast Asian country. Aragonés drew the noses of the islanders in Lat's distinctive style, and named one of the prominent native characters—an inquisitive boy—after the Malaysian cartoonist.

Lent (2003) and Shimizu (1996) both suggest that the Malaysian comic industry began to boom after Lat joined the profession on a full-time basis in 1974. Lent further hazards that the cartoonist profession was made more respectable in Malaysia by the award to Lat in 1994 of a "<a href="Malay%20styles%20and%20titles%23Dato%27">datuk</a>" title (equivalent to a <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">knighthood</a>). Bestowed on Lat by the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Perak">Sultan of Perak</a>, the title was Malaysia's highest recognition of the cartoonist's influence on his countrymen and his contributions to the country. Before Lat's emergence, Malaysian cartooning was largely unappreciated by the public, despite the popular works of Raja Hamzad and Rejabhad. Lat's successes showed Malaysians that they could thrive and succeed as cartoonists, and inspired them to look to the cartooning profession for potential careers. Several younger artists imitated his style in the hopes of capturing equivalent rewards. Zambriabu and Rasyid Asmawi copied the distinctive three loop noses and hairstyles of Lat's characters. Others, such as Reggie Lee and Nan, incorporated Lat's detailed "thematic and stylistic approaches" in their works. Muliyadi dubbed Lat the "Father of Contemporary Malaysian Cartoons", for being the first Malaysian cartoonist to achieve global recognition and for helping to improve the industry's image in their country.

The effects of Lat's works were not confined to the artistic sector. In the period before his debut, Malaysian cartoonists supported calls for national unity. The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. The situation erupted with the <a href="13%20May%20incident">racial riots of 1969</a>, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation's racial woes with his works. Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. Redza pointed out although one may argue that Lat was forced into the role of racial and cultural mediator (because of his employment with his country's "leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership"), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. Lat's fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as "a safe and nice humour that made everyone feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides". It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000 copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of <a href="Xenophobia">xenophobic</a> phrases, full of profound sadness.
Lat's works have been used in academic studies—the fields of which are diverse, spanning law, urban planning, and diets. The academics use his drawings to help them illustrate their points in a humorous yet educational manner. Foreign embassy officials have sought Lat for his insight into the cultures of their societies. They have invited him to tour their countries, in the hope that he will record his experiences in cartoon form to share with the world. The first country to do so was the United States, followed by others such as Australia, Germany, and Japan. In 1998, Lat became the first cartoonist to be made an Eisenhower Fellow and revisited the United States; his research programme was the study of relationships among the many races in United States society. In 2007, the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Malaysia">National University of Malaysia</a> awarded him an honorary Doctorate in <a href="Anthropology">Anthropology</a> and Sociology. Lat's works are recognised as visual records of Malaysia's cultural history; he was awarded a <a href="Fukuoka%20Asian%20Culture%20Prize">Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize</a> in 2002 for preserving Malay rural culture in his works.

In 1986, Lat became the first cartoonist to exhibit his work at the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur; the event drew a record number of 600,000 visitors in two months. He is treated as a celebrity, and his cartoon characters decorate stamps, <a href="Personal%20finance">financial guides</a>, and aeroplanes. When "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" asked Malaysians in 2010 to rank which of 50 local personalities was most worthy of trust, Lat was returned fourth on the list. According to Jaafar, "100% of Malaysians respect and admire Lat, and see a Malaysian truth, whether he is drawing a policeman, teachers, or hookers."

Porbeagle

The porbeagle ("Lamna nasus") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Lamniformes">mackerel shark</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Lamnidae">Lamnidae</a>, distributed widely in the cold and temperate marine waters of the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> and <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. In the <a href="North%20Pacific">North Pacific</a>, its ecological equivalent is the closely related <a href="salmon%20shark">salmon shark</a> ("L. ditropis"). The porbeagle typically reaches in length and a weight of ; North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow <a href="caudal%20peduncle">base of the tail</a>. It has large <a href="pectoral%20fin">pectoral</a> and first <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a>s, tiny <a href="pelvic%20fin">pelvic</a>, second dorsal, and <a href="anal%20fin">anal fin</a>s, and a crescent-shaped <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a>. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.

The porbeagle is an opportunistic hunter that preys mainly on <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>es and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s throughout the <a href="water%20column">water column</a>, including the bottom. Most commonly found over food-rich <a href="bank%20%28topography%29">banks</a> on the outer <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>, it makes occasional forays both close to shore and into the <a href="open%20ocean">open ocean</a> to a depth of . It also conducts long-distance seasonal <a href="fish%20migration">migrations</a>, generally shifting between shallower and deeper water. The porbeagle is fast and highly active, with <a href="endothermy">physiological adaptations</a> that enable it to maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. It can be solitary or gregarious, and has been known to perform seemingly <a href="play%20%28activity%29">playful</a> behavior. This shark is <a href="aplacental%20viviparous">aplacental viviparous</a> with <a href="oophagy">oophagy</a>, developing <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s being retained within the mother's <a href="uterus">uterus</a> and subsisting on <a href="trophic%20egg">non-viable eggs</a>. Females typically bear four pups every year.

Only a few <a href="shark%20attack">shark attack</a>s of uncertain provenance have been attributed to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a <a href="game%20fish">game fish</a> by <a href="recreational%20fishing">recreational anglers</a>. The <a href="shark%20meat">meat</a> and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial fishing</a> for the porbeagle, principally by <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="longline%20fishing">longliners</a>, led to <a href="fish%20stock">stock</a> collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a>, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> worldwide, and as either <a href="endangered">endangered</a> or <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> in different parts of its northern range.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the word "porbeagle" is obscure. A common suggestion is that it combines "<a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>" and "<a href="beagle">beagle</a>", referencing this shark's shape and tenacious hunting habits. Another is that it is derived from the <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a> "porth", meaning "<a href="harbor">harbor</a>", and "bugel", meaning "<a href="shepherd">shepherd</a>". The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" states that the word was either borrowed from Cornish or formed from a Cornish first element with the English "beagle". The "Dictionary" also notes that no evidence exists for a connection to the <a href="French%20language">French</a> "porc", meaning "swine", or to "porpoise", as has been proposed. Other <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s for the porbeagle include Atlantic mackerel shark, Beaumaris shark, bottle-nosed shark, and blue dog.

The first <a href="scientific%20description">scientific description</a> of the porbeagle was authored by French <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Bonnaterre">Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre</a> in the 1788 "<a href="Tableau%20encyclop%C3%A9dique%20et%20m%C3%A9thodique">Tableau encyclopédique et methodique des trois règnes de la nature</a>", and based on an earlier 1769 account by Welsh naturalist <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a>. Bonnaterre named the shark "Squalus nasus", the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "nasus" being <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "nose". In 1816, French naturalist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> placed the porbeagle into its own subgenus, "Lamna", which later authors elevated to the rank of full genus.

Several <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> studies, based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological characters</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequences, have established the <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a> relationship between the porbeagle and the salmon shark ("L. ditropis"), which occurs in place of it in the North Pacific. The genus "Lamna" evolved 65–45 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">Mya</a>. When its two extant species <a href="speciation">diverged</a> from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the <a href="Arctic%20ice%20pack">ice cap</a> over the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific from those in the North Atlantic.

<a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>ized porbeagle remains are known from <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a> <a href="geologic%20timescale">epoch</a> (about 7.2 Mya) deposits in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and the Netherlands, <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> epoch (5.3–2.6 Mya) deposits in Belgium, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch (2.6 Mya to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, "Lamna" teeth that closely resemble those of the porbeagle have been found in the La Meseta Formation on <a href="Seymour%20Island">Seymour Island</a> off the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>, which date to the middle to late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a> (50–34 Mya). Much taxonomic confusion remains regarding "Lamna" in the fossil record due to the high degree of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.

The porbeagle has an almost global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is absent from the tropics; in the North Pacific, its <a href="ecological%20niche">niche</a> is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland Grand Banks</a> off <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, through southern <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>; the southern limit of its range extends from <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, through the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, to <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. It is found in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, but not the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a>, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the <a href="Sargasso%20Sea">Sargasso Sea</a>, almost as far as <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the <a href="Antarctic%20Convergence">Antarctic Convergence</a>, and extending as far north as <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> <a href="Provinces%20of%20South%20Africa">province</a> of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> to southern <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. In New Zealand it is most common south of the Cook Strait. The porbeagle is thought to have colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a> (beginning around 2.6 Mya), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.

Offshore <a href="fishing%20bank">fishing bank</a>s are the favored habitat of the porbeagle, though it can be found from a depth of in <a href="oceanic%20basin">oceanic basin</a>s to <a href="littoral">littoral</a> (close to shore) waters less than deep, over the entire <a href="water%20column">water column</a>. A single, anomalous record was made of a juvenile in <a href="brackish%20water">brackish water</a> in <a href="Mar%20Chiquita">Mar Chiquita</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. A tracking study off the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> has found substantial variation in the short-term movements of this species, both between and within individuals. Vertical movements tended to increase with water depth and corresponding temperature <a href="stratification%20%28water%29">stratification</a>; in shallow, unstratified waters, sharks either showed no pattern in changing depth or made reverse <a href="diel%20vertical%20migration">diel movements</a>, spending the day in shallow water and descending at night. In deeper, stratified waters, the sharks performed a regular diel migration, spending the day below the <a href="thermocline">thermocline</a> and rising towards the surface at night. The porbeagle has been reported across a temperature range of , with most records between . In a study that included 420 porbeagles caught in the northwest Atlantic off Canada, all were in water below and the majority between .

Porbeagle populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres appear to be completely separate. Two stocks are in the North Atlantic, east and west, that seldom mix; only one individual is known to have crossed the Atlantic, covering from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> to <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Several discrete stocks are likely present in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. This species segregates by size and sex in the North Atlantic, and at least by size in the South Pacific. For example, males outnumber females 2:1 off <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, females are 30% more numerous than males off <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and immature males are predominant in the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a>. Older, larger sharks may frequent higher latitudes than younger individuals.

Seasonal <a href="fish%20migration">migrations</a> have been observed in porbeagles from both hemispheres. In the western North Atlantic, much of the population spends the spring in the deep waters of the <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>, and migrates north a distance of to spend late summer and fall in the shallow waters of the Newfoundland Grand Banks and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20St.%20Lawrence">Gulf of St. Lawrence</a>. In December, large, mature females migrate south over into the Sargasso Sea for pupping, keeping deeper than during the day and at night so as to stay in the cooler waters beneath the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. In the eastern North Atlantic, porbeagles are believed to spend spring and summer in shallow continental shelf waters, and disperse northwards to overwinter in deeper waters offshore. Migrating sharks may travel upwards of , though once they reach their destination they tend to remain within a relatively localized area. In the South Pacific, the population shifts north past 30°S latitude into <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> waters in winter and spring, and retreats south past 35°S latitude in summer, when sharks are frequently sighted off <a href="subantarctic">subantarctic</a> islands.

The porbeagle is a very stout-bodied shark with a fusiform (spindle-like) shape. The long, conical snout tapers to a sharp point, and is supported by enlarged, highly <a href="calcification">calcified</a> <a href="wikt%3Arostral">rostral</a> <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a>s. The eyes are large and black, without <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s (protective third eyelids). The small, S-shaped <a href="nostril">nostril</a>s are positioned in front of and below the level of the eyes. The mouth is large and strongly curved, with moderately protrusible jaws. North Atlantic sharks have 28–29 upper tooth rows and 26–27 lower tooth rows, while Southern Hemisphere sharks have 30–31 upper tooth rows and 27–29 lower tooth rows. Each tooth has a strongly arched base and a nearly straight, awl-like central cusp, which is flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets in all but the smallest individuals. The five pairs of <a href="gill%20slit">gill slit</a>s are long and precede the <a href="pectoral%20fin">pectoral fin</a> bases.

The pectoral fins are long and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The <a href="pelvic%20fin">pelvic fin</a>s are much smaller than the first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and <a href="anal%20fin">anal fin</a>s are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the <a href="caudal%20peduncle">caudal peduncle</a> are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a> is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) are at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch is near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened <a href="dermal%20denticle">dermal denticle</a>s (<a href="scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a>), lending a <a href="velvet">velvet</a>y texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.

The dorsal coloration is a medium to dark gray or slate, extending to the bases of the pectoral fins. The underside is white; adults in the Southern Hemisphere often have dark coloring under the head and dusky blotches scattered over the belly. The free rear tip of the first dorsal fin is abruptly light gray or white, a feature unique to this species. The porbeagle may attain a length of , though this is uncertain and may have resulted from confusion with other mackerel shark species. A more typical length is . Female sharks grow larger than males in the North Atlantic, with maximum confirmed <a href="fork%20length">fork length</a>s (snout tip to caudal fin fork) of for males and for females. Southern Hemisphere sharks are smaller and the two sexes are similar in size, with males and females attaining fork lengths of and respectively. Most porbeagles weigh no more than , with the record being a individual caught off <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, in 1993.

Fast and energetic, the porbeagle can be found singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a>s for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been <a href="convergent%20evolution">independently evolved</a> by <a href="tuna">tuna</a>s, <a href="billfish">billfish</a>es, and several other groups of active fishes. The salmon shark and it are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style; they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but at the cost of maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of <a href="aerobic%20metabolism">aerobic</a> "red muscle" along each side, which can contract independently of the regular "white muscle" at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.

Porbeagles are among the few fishes that exhibit apparent <a href="play%20%28animal%20behavior%29">play</a> behavior. Reports, principally off the <a href="Cornwall">Cornish</a> coast, have this species rolling and repeatedly wrapping themselves in long <a href="kelp">kelp</a> fronds near the surface; this activity may have an exploratory or self-stimulatory purpose, though alternately, the sharks may be attempting to feed on small kelp organisms or scrape off parasites. In addition, porbeagles within a group have been seen chasing each other, and they will reportedly "play with anything floating on the water"; individuals have been observed prodding, tossing, or biting natural and artificial objects, including pieces of <a href="driftwood">driftwood</a> and <a href="fishing%20float">balloon floats</a> used by anglers.

<a href="Great%20white%20shark">Great white shark</a>s ("Carcharodon carcharias") and <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a>s ("Orcinus orca") are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. In one record, a small individual caught off <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> bore bite marks from a <a href="copper%20shark">copper shark</a> ("Carcharhinus brachyurus") or similar species, but whether the porbeagle was the target of attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression is uncertain. Known <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s of this species include the <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s "Dinobothrium septaria" and "Hepatoxylon trichiuri", and the <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s "Dinemoura producta", "Laminifera doello-juradoi", and "Pandarus floridanus". Natural annual <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality</a> is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.

The porbeagle is an active <a href="predator">predator</a> that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>es. It chases down <a href="pelagic%20fish">pelagic fish</a>es such as <a href="lancet%20fish">lancet fish</a>, <a href="mackerel">mackerel</a>, <a href="pilchard">pilchard</a>s, <a href="herring">herring</a>, and <a href="saury">sauries</a>, and forages near the bottom for <a href="groundfish">groundfish</a>es such as <a href="Gadidae">cod</a>, <a href="Merluccidae">hake</a>, <a href="Channichthyidae">icefish</a>, <a href="Zeidae">dories</a>, <a href="sand%20lance">sand lance</a>s, <a href="lumpsucker">lumpsucker</a>s, and <a href="flatfish">flatfish</a>. <a href="Cephalopod">Cephalopod</a>s, particularly <a href="squid">squid</a>, also form an important component of its diet, while smaller sharks such as <a href="spiny%20dogfish">spiny dogfish</a> ("Squalus acanthias") and <a href="tope%20shark">tope shark</a>s ("Galeorhinus galeus") are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="echinoderms">echinoderms</a>, and other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, <a href="feather">feather</a>s, and garbage fragments.

In the western North Atlantic, porbeagles feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on groundfishes in the fall; this pattern corresponds to the spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats. Therefore, the porbeagle seems to be an opportunistic predator without strong diet specificity. During spring and summer in the <a href="Celtic%20Sea">Celtic Sea</a> and on the outer Nova <a href="Scotian%20Shelf">Scotian Shelf</a>, porbeagles congregate at <a href="tidal">tidal</a>ly induced thermal fronts to feed on fish that have been drawn by high concentrations of <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>. Hunting porbeagles regularly dive from the surface all the way to the bottom, cycling back every few hours; this vertical movement may aid in the detection of <a href="olfaction">olfactory</a> cues. A one-year-old porbeagle long, was reported to have had fed on <a href="krill">krill</a> and <a href="polychaete%20worm">polychaete worm</a>s.

The timing of the porbeagle's reproductive cycle is unusual in that it is largely similar in both hemispheres, rather than being offset by six months. This suggests that its reproduction is not significantly affected by temperature or day length, perhaps owing to its endothermic physiology. Mating takes place mainly between September and November, though females with fresh mating scars have been reported as late as January off the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>. The male bites at the female's pectoral fins, gill region, and flanks while courting and to hold on for <a href="animal%20sexual%20behavior">copulation</a>. Two mating grounds are known for western North Atlantic porbeagles, one off <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> and the other on <a href="Georges%20Bank">Georges Bank</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Gulf of Maine</a>. Adult females have a single functional <a href="ovary">ovary</a>, on the right, and two functional uteri. They probably reproduce every year. The litter size is typically four, with two embryos oriented in opposing directions sharing each uterus; on rare occasions, a litter may contain as few as one or as many as five pups. The <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period is 8–9 months.

Like other members of its family, the porbeagle is <a href="aplacental%20viviparous">aplacental viviparous</a> with <a href="oophagy">oophagy</a>, i.e. the main source of embryonic nutrition are unfertilized eggs. During the first half of pregnancy, the mother <a href="ovulation">ovulates</a> enormous numbers of tiny <a href="ovum">ova</a>, packed into <a href="egg%20case%20%28Chondrichthyes%29">capsules</a> up to long, into her uteri. A newly conceived embryo is sustained by a <a href="yolk%20sac">yolk sac</a> and emerges from its egg capsule at long. At this time, the embryo has well-developed <a href="external%20gills">external gills</a> and a <a href="spiral%20valve">spiral valve</a> <a href="intestine">intestine</a>. When the embryo is long, it has resorbed its external gills and most of its yolk sac, but cannot yet feed, as it lacks the means to open egg capsules. At a length of , the embryo grows two massive, recurved "fangs" in the lower jaw for tearing open capsules, as well as two much smaller teeth in the upper jaw. It begins to feed voraciously on yolk, acquiring an enormously distended stomach; to accommodate this, the muscles on the belly split down the middle and the skin on the abdomen stretches greatly.

At long, the embryo appears pink because it lacks <a href="pigment">pigment</a> except in its eyes, and its head and gill regions are laterally enlarged and gelatinous. The yolk stomach can comprise up to 81% of the embryo's total weight when it is long. The embryo gains pigment and sheds its fangs at a length of . Around this time, the mother stops producing ova. From then on, the embryo relies mainly on the yolk stored in its stomach, though it may continue to feed on remaining eggs by squishing the capsules between its jaws or swallowing them whole. It begins to transfer its energy stores from its stomach to its liver, causing the former to shrink and the latter to grow exponentially. The embryo is essentially fully pigmented by a length of , and has assumed its newborn appearance by a length of . By then, its stomach has shrunk enough for the abdominal muscles to close, leaving what has been termed an "umbilical scar" or "yolk sac scar" (neither is accurate). Several series of single-cusped teeth grow in both jaws, though they lie flat and remain nonfunctional until birth.
Newborn porbeagles measure long and do not exceed . Up to a tenth of the weight is made up of the liver, though some yolk also remains in its stomach and continues to sustain the pup until it learns to feed. The overall embryonic growth rate is per month. Sometimes, one pup in a uterus is much smaller than the other, but otherwise normal. These "runts" may result from a dominant, forward-facing embryo eating most of the eggs as they arrive, and/or the mother being unable to provide an adequate egg supply for all her offspring. Birthing occurs from April to September, peaking in April and May (spring-summer) for North Atlantic sharks and June and July (winter) for Southern Hemisphere sharks. In the western North Atlantic, birth occurs well offshore in the Sargasso Sea at depths around .

Both sexes grow at similar rates until the onset of maturation, with females maturing later and at a larger size than males. In the first four years of life, the annual growth rate is and similar in both hemispheres; thereafter, sharks from the western South Pacific begin to grow slower than those from the North Atlantic. In the North Atlantic, males mature at a fork length of and an age of 6–11 years, and females at a fork length of and an age of 12–18 years. In the Southwest Pacific, males mature at a fork length of and an age of 8–11 years, and females at a fork length of and an age of 15–18 years. The oldest porbeagle on record was 26 years of age and measured long. The <a href="maximum%20lifespan">maximum lifespan</a> of this species appears to be 30–40 years in the Atlantic, but could be as much as 65 years in the South Pacific.

Like other members of its family, the porbeagle is <a href="endothermy">endothermic</a>; <a href="Metabolism">metabolic</a> heat generated by its red muscles is conserved within the body by specialized systems of <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s called "retia mirabilia" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "wonderful nets"; singular "rete mirabile"), that act as highly efficient <a href="countercurrent%20exchange">countercurrent</a> <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a>s. The porbeagle has several "rete mirabile" systems: the orbital "retia" accessing its brain and eyes, the lateral cutaneous "retia" accessing its swimming muscles, the suprahepatic "rete" accessing its <a href="viscera">viscera</a>, and the <a href="kidney">kidney</a> "rete".

Among sharks, the porbeagle's capacity for elevating body temperature is second only to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the <a href="vertebral%20column">spine</a>, and its lateral "rete" is composed of over 4,000 small <a href="artery">arteries</a> arranged in bands. It has one of the highest core temperatures within its family, 8–10 °C (14–18 °F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital "retia" of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6 °C (5–11 °F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced <a href="reaction%20time">response times</a>.

The porbeagle has very rarely, if ever, bitten swimmers or boats. As of 2009, the <a href="International%20Shark%20Attack%20File">International Shark Attack File</a> attributes three bites to this species, one provoked and none fatal, and two on boats. One older anecdote tells of a fisherman who provoked a porbeagle into leaping from the water and tearing his clothes. In another account of a swimmer bitten by a "mackerel shark", the species responsible could easily have been a misidentified <a href="shortfin%20mako">shortfin mako</a> or great white shark. Recently in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, adult porbeagles have been filmed charging at divers working on <a href="oil%20platform">oil platform</a>s, sometimes even brushing lightly against them without doing harm. These rushes do not appear to have predatory intent and may instead be motivated by curiosity or defense.

On 14 May 2018, a porbeagle shark was reported to have bitten a fisherman off the coast of <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, as it was being returned to the sea.<a href="https%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-44113912"></a>

At one time, porbeagles were regarded as nuisances by some commercial fishers because they damaged lighter fishing gear intended for smaller species and stole hooked fish from lines. This shark is highly valued as a <a href="game%20fish">game fish</a> by <a href="recreational%20fishing">sport fishers</a> in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It fights strongly on hook-and-line, but does not usually jump into the air like the related <a href="shortfin%20mako%20shark">shortfin mako shark</a>. Novice anglers often mistake this shark for the mako, which has earned it the affectionate moniker "fako" in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. The <a href="International%20Game%20Fish%20Association">International Game Fish Association</a> keeps records on the porbeagle.

Prized for its <a href="shark%20meat">meat</a> and fins, the porbeagle has long been under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998, it had a wholesale price of 5–7 eur/kg, four times that of the <a href="blue%20shark">blue shark</a> ("Prionace glauca"). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> for use in <a href="shark%20fin%20soup">shark fin soup</a>. The remainder of the shark may also be used for production of <a href="leather">leather</a>, <a href="shark%20liver%20oil">liver oil</a>, and <a href="fishmeal">fishmeal</a>. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified, as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on <a href="longline%20fishing">longlines</a>, but is also susceptible to <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a>s, <a href="driftnet">driftnet</a>s, <a href="trawl">trawl</a>s, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a>; if storage space cannot be spared, it may be <a href="shark%20finning">finned</a> and the carcass discarded.

Intensive fishing for the porbeagle dates back the 1930s, when <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Soon after, the stock collapsed; Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, and saw a decline from an annual catch over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in <a href="international%20water">international water</a>s. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.

As porbeagles had become scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s, the Norwegian fishing fleet moved west to the waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, they were joined by longline vessels from the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, where porbeagle ("smeriglio") is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years; by 1970, Norwegian catches had fallen under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> established an <a href="Exclusive%20Economic%20Zone">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. Some evidence shows that incidental <a href="artificial%20selection">artificial selection</a> caused by heavy fishing has led to a <a href="compensatory%20growth">compensatory growth</a> response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.

In the Southern Hemisphere, commercial fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable species such as <a href="southern%20bluefin%20tuna">southern bluefin tuna</a> ("Thunnus maccoyii"), <a href="swordfish">swordfish</a> ("Xiphius gladius"), and <a href="Patagonian%20toothfish">Patagonian toothfish</a> ("Dissostichus eleginoides"), including vessels operated by <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of <a href="catch%20per%20unit%20effort">catch per unit effort</a> for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits is uncertain. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.

The rapid collapse of porbeagle stocks on both sides of the North Atlantic is often cited as archetypal of the "boom and bust" pattern of most shark fisheries. Factors including a small litter size, long maturation time, and the capture of multiple age classes all contribute to this shark's susceptibility to <a href="overfishing">overfishing</a>. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> has assessed the porbeagle globally as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>, <a href="endangered">endangered</a> in the western North Atlantic (including the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>), and <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> in the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.

The porbeagle is listed on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the <a href="UN%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> and on Annex 1 of the <a href="Bonn%20Convention">Conservation of Migratory Species</a> (CMS; also known as the <a href="Bonn%20Convention">Bonn Convention</a>) <a href="Migratory%20Sharks%20MoU">Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding</a>. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the European Union, and the <a href="International%20Commission%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Atlantic%20Tunas">International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas</a>. Although the Animals Committee of the UN <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.

In March 2015, The <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> (NMFS) responded to a court order to compile information as to whether the shark will be listed as threatened or endangered under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>.

The only regulation of porbeagle catches in the Southern Hemisphere is New Zealand's total allowable catch of 249 tons per year, instituted in 2004. In June 2018 the New Zealand <a href="Department%20of%20Conservation%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Department of Conservation</a> classified the porbeagle as "Not Threatened" with the qualifier "Threatened Overseas" under the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Threat%20Classification%20System">New Zealand Threat Classification System</a>.

In the eastern North Atlantic, porbeagle fishing has been illegal in waters of the European Union since 2011. From 1985 and until the EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons, respectively, from <a href="European%20Community">European Community</a> waters. Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch in the region, thus had no practical effect. The species is included on the <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">red list</a> of Norway and it has been protected in their national waters since 2012. Any porbeagle caught in EU or Norwegian waters by accident must be released.

In the Mediterranean Sea, the porbeagle is on the verge of extinction, with a population decline over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a>, where a nursery area may exist. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III ("species whose exploitation is regulated") of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.

The European Union prohibits EU vessels from fishing for, retaining, boarding, transhipping, or landing porbeagle sharks in all waters since January 2011. It is subject to a zero total allowable catch in EU waters by any vessel.

The western North Atlantic porbeagle population has a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted for the period of 2002–2007. The mating grounds off Newfoundland were also closed to shark fishing. In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada listed the porbeagle as endangered, largely on the basis of the low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (after processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a <a href="species%20of%20concern">species of concern</a> by the NMFS, meaning that it merits conservation concern, but data are insufficient for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.

Muhammad al-Durrah incident

The Muhammad al-Durrah incident took place in the <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a> on 30 September 2000, on the second day of the <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Intifada</a>, during widespread rioting throughout the <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a>. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for <a href="France%202">France 2</a>, as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.

Fifty-nine seconds of the footage were broadcast in France with a voiceover from <a href="Charles%20Enderlin">Charles Enderlin</a>, the station's bureau chief in Israel, who was not present during the shooting. Based on information from the cameraman, Enderlin told viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the "target of fire from the Israeli positions" and that the boy had died. After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Muslim world as a <a href="shahid">martyr</a>.

Over the months and years that followed, commentators questioned the accuracy of France 2's report. The <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France 2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France 2's news editor said in 2005 that no one could be sure who fired the shots. Other commentators, particularly <a href="Philippe%20Karsenty">Philippe Karsenty</a>, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by France 2; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20Paris">Court of Appeal of Paris</a>. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation.

The footage of the father and son acquired what one writer called the power of a battle flag. Postage stamps in the Middle East carried the images; one of the images was visible in the background when <a href="Daniel%20Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a>, a Jewish-American journalist, was beheaded by <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> in 2002. <a href="James%20Fallows">James Fallows</a> wrote of the controversy that "no version of truth that is considered believable by all sides will ever emerge."

On 28 September 2000, two days before the shooting, the Israeli opposition leader <a href="Ariel%20Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> visited the <a href="Temple%20Mount">Temple Mount</a> in the <a href="Old%20City%20of%20Jerusalem">Old City of Jerusalem</a>, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> and Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.

The <a href="Netzarim">Netzarim</a> junction, where the shooting took place, is known locally as the "al-Shohada" (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza City</a>. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's <a href="Israel%27s%20unilateral%20disengagement%20plan">withdrawal from Gaza in 2005</a>. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in the days before the shooting.

Jamal al-Durrah (born c. 1963) was a carpenter and house painter before the shooting. Since then, because of his injuries, he has worked as a truck driver. He and his wife, Amal, live in the <a href="United%20Nations%20Relief%20and%20Works%20Agency%20for%20Palestine%20Refugees%20in%20the%20Near%20East">UNRWA</a>-run <a href="Bureij%20%28camp%29">Bureij refugee camp</a> in the Gaza Strip. As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons, including a boy, Muhammad, born two years after the shooting.

Until the shooting, Jamal had worked for Moshe Tamam, an Israeli contractor, for 20 years, since he was 14. Writer Helen Schary Motro came to know Jamal when she employed him to help build her house in Tel Aviv. She described his years of rising at 3:30 am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six. Tamam called him a "terrific man," someone he trusted to work alone in his customers' homes.

Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was in fifth grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> had called for a general strike and day of mourning following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.

<a href="Charles%20Enderlin">Charles Enderlin</a> was born in 1945 in Paris; his grandparents were Austrian Jews who had left the country in 1938 <a href="Anschluss">when Germany invaded</a>. After briefly studying medicine, he moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where he became an Israeli national. He began working for France 2 in 1981, serving as their bureau chief in Israel from 1990 until his retirement in 2015. Enderlin is the author of several books about the Middle East, including one about Muhammad al-Durrah, "Un Enfant est Mort: Netzarim, 30 Septembre 2000" (2010). Highly regarded among his peers and within the French establishment, he submitted a letter from <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a>, during the Philippe Karsenty libel action, who wrote in flattering terms of Enderlin's integrity. In 2009 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>.

According to journalist , Enderlin's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As a result of the al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.

Talal Hassan Abu Rahma studied business administration in the United States, and began working as a freelance cameraman for France 2 in Gaza in 1988. At the time of the shooting, he ran his own press office, the National News Center, contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office, and was a board member of the Palestinian Journalists' Association. His coverage of the al-Durrah shooting brought him several journalism awards, including the <a href="Rory%20Peck%20Award">Rory Peck Award</a> in 2001. According to France 2 correspondent Gérard Grizbec, Abu Rahma had never been a member of a Palestinian political group, had twice been arrested by Palestinian police for filming images that did not meet the approval of <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>, and had never been accused of security breaches by Israel.

On the day of the shooting—<a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a>, the Jewish New Year—the two-story <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) outpost at the Netzarim junction was manned by Israeli soldiers from the <a href="Givati%20Brigade">Givati Brigade</a> Engineering Platoon and the <a href="IDF%20Sword%20Battalion">Herev Battalion</a>. According to Enderlin, the soldiers were <a href="Druze%20in%20Israel">Druze</a>.

The two-story IDF outpost sat northwest of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Security%20Forces">Palestinian National Security Forces</a> outpost under the command of Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the <a href="Palestine%20National%20Council">Palestine National Council</a>. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.

In addition to France 2, the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> and <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> also had camera crews at the junction. They captured brief footage of the al-Durrahs and Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the moment the al-Durrahs were shot.

Jamal and Muhammad arrived at the junction in a cab around midday, on their way back from the car auction.

Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover against the concrete wall in the south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a <a href="culvert">culvert</a>, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat on top of the drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15 metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.

In an affidavit three days after the shooting, Abu Rahma said shots had been fired for about 45 minutes and that he had filmed around 27 minutes of it. (How much film was shot became a bone of contention in 2007 when France 2 that only 18 minutes of film existed.) He began filming Jamal and Muhammad when he heard Muhammad cry and saw that the boy had been shot in the right leg. He said he filmed the scene containing the father and son for about six minutes. He sent those six minutes to Enderlin in Jerusalem via satellite. Enderlin edited the footage down to 59 seconds and added a voiceover:
1500 hours. Everything has just erupted near the settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians have shot live bullets, the Israelis are responding. Paramedics, journalists, passersby are caught in the crossfire. Here, Jamal and his son Mohammed are the target of fire from the Israeli positions. Mohammed is twelve, his father is trying to protect him. He is motioning. Another burst of fire. Mohammed is dead and his father seriously wounded.

The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad crouching behind the cylinder, the child screaming and the father shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something in the direction of the cameraman, then waves and shouts in the direction of the Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.

The <a href="%23break%20in%20footage">raw footage stops suddenly</a> at this point and begins again with unidentified people being loaded into an ambulance. (At that point in his report, Enderlin said: "A Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver have also lost their lives in the course of this battle.") Bassam al-Bilbeisi, an ambulance driver on his way to the scene, was reported to have been shot and killed, leaving a widow and 11 children. Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up father and son together. He said he did not film them being picked up because he was worried about having only one battery. Abu Rahma remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes until he felt it was safe to leave, then drove to his studio in Gaza City to send the footage to Enderlin. The 59 seconds of footage were first broadcast on France 2's nightly news at 8:00 pm local time (GMT+2), after which France 2 distributed several minutes of raw footage around the world without charge.

Jamal and Muhammad were taken by ambulance to the <a href="Al-Shifa%20Hospital">Al-Shifa Hospital</a> in Gaza City. Abu Rhama telephoned the hospital and was told that three bodies had arrived there: that of a jeep driver, an ambulance driver, and a boy, initially named by mistake as Rami Al-Durrah.

According to Dr. Abed El-Razeq El Masry, the pathologist who examined Muhammed, the boy had received a fatal injury to the abdomen. In 2002 he showed <a href="Esther%20Schapira">Esther Schapira</a>, a German journalist, post-mortem images of Muhammad next to cards identifying him by name. Schapira also obtained, from a Palestinian journalist, what appeared to be footage of him arriving at the hospital on a stretcher. During an emotional public funeral in the Bureij refugee camp, Muhammad was wrapped in a <a href="Palestinian%20flag">Palestinian flag</a> and buried before sundown on the day of his death, in accordance with Muslim tradition.

Jamal was taken at first to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had received multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and the lower part of both legs; his <a href="femoral%20artery">femoral artery</a> was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the <a href="King%20Hussein%20Medical%20Center">King Hussein Medical Center</a> in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by <a href="Abdullah%20II%20of%20Jordan">King Abdullah</a>. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.

Enderlin based his allegation that the IDF had shot the boy on the report of the cameraman, Talal Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots. For example, he told "The Guardian": "They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father. They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times." Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. He told National Public Radio:
I saw the boy getting injured in his leg, and the father asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the ambulances to help him, because he could see the ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance ... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [Jamal and Muhammad] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, "Help me." I said, "I cannot, I can't help you." The shooting till then was really heavy ... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45 minutes. Then ... I hear something, "boom!" Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed ... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.

Abu Rahma alleged in an affidavit that "the child was intentionally and in cold blood shot dead and his father injured by the Israeli army." The affidavit was given to the <a href="Palestinian%20Centre%20for%20Human%20Rights">Palestinian Centre for Human Rights</a> in Gaza and signed by the cameraman in the presence of <a href="Raji%20Sourani">Raji Sourani</a>, a human rights lawyer. France 2's communications director, Christine Delavennat, said in 2008 that Abu Rahma denied having accused the Israeli army of firing at the boy in cold blood, and that this had been falsely attributed to him.

The position of the IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in 2000 to retracting the admission in 2005. The IDF's first response, when Enderlin contacted them before his broadcast, was that the Palestinians "make cynical use of women and children," which he decided not to air.

On 3 October 2000, the IDF's chief of operations, Major-General <a href="Giora%20Eiland">Giora Eiland</a>, said an internal investigation indicated the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers. The soldiers, under fire, had been shooting from small slits in the wall of their outpost; General Yom-Tov Samia, then head of the IDF's Southern Command said they may not have had a clear field of vision, and had fired in the direction from which they believed the fire was coming. Eiland issued an apology: "This was a grave incident, an event we are all sorry about."

The Israelis had been trying for hours to speak to Palestinian commanders, according to Israel's Cabinet Secretary, <a href="Isaac%20Herzog">Isaac Herzog</a>; he added that Palestinian security forces could have intervened to stop the fire.

Three mainstream narratives emerged after the shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire had killed the boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire was more likely to have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by <a href="Denis%20Jeambar">Denis Jeambar</a>, editor-in-chief of "L'Express", and , a former France 2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by <a href="Arlette%20Chabot">Arlette Chabot</a>, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.

A fourth, minority, position held that the scene was staged by Palestinian protesters to produce a child martyr or at least the appearance of one. This is known by those who follow the case as the "maximalist" view, as opposed to the "minimalist" view that the shots were probably not fired by the IDF. The maximalist view takes the form either that the al-Durrahs were not shot and Muhammad did not die, or that he was killed intentionally by Palestinians.

The view that the scene was a media hoax of some kind emerged from an <a href="%23Shahaf%20report">Israeli government enquiry</a> in November 2000. It was most persistently pursued by Stéphane Juffa, editor-in-chief of the (Mena), a French-Israeli company; <a href="Luc%20Rosenzweig">Luc Rosenzweig</a>, former editor-in-chief of "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" and a Mena contributor; <a href="Richard%20Landes">Richard Landes</a>, an American historian who became involved after Enderlin showed him the raw footage during a visit to Jerusalem in 2003; and <a href="Philippe%20Karsenty">Philippe Karsenty</a>, founder of a French media-watchdog site, "Media-Ratings". It was also supported by , a French psychoanalyst, and <a href="Pierre-Andr%C3%A9%20Taguieff">Pierre-André Taguieff</a>, a French philosopher who specializes in <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, both of whom wrote books about the affair. The hoax view gained further support in 2013 from a second Israeli government report, the <a href="%23Kuperwasser%20report">Kuperwasser report</a>. Several commentators regard it as a right-wing <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> and smear campaign.

Key issues include <a href="%23length%20of%20footage">how much footage was shot</a>; that it was blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France 2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the cameraman <a href="%23break%20in%20footage">stopped filming</a> at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.

Several commentators questioned <a href="%23timeline">what time</a> the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. <a href="%23father%27s%20injuries">One physician maintained</a> that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.

There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General <a href="Yom%20Tov%20Samia">Yom Tov Samia</a> of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.

A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad. In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: "We have some secrets for ourselves. We cannot give anything ... everything." According to Jamal al-Durrah, five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman. In 2013 he said, without elaborating: "The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority."

Questions arose about how much footage existed and whether it showed the boy had died. Abu Rahma said in an affidavit that the gunfight had lasted 45 minutes and that he had filmed about 27 minutes of it. Doreen Carvajal of the "International Herald Tribune" said in 2005 that France 2 had shown the newspaper "the original 27-minute tape of the incident." When the Court of Appeal of Paris asked, in 2007, to see all the footage, during France 2's libel case against Philippe Karsenty, France 2 presented the court with 18 minutes of film, saying the rest had been destroyed because it had not been about the shooting. Enderlin then said only 18 minutes of footage had been shot.

According to Abu Rahma, six minutes of his footage focused on the al-Durrahs. France 2 broadcast 59 seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his hand away from his face. Enderlin said he had cut this scene in accordance with the France 2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes (""agonie""), which he said was "unbearable" (""J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable ... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus"). In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word "agony", not "agonie". If he were editing the footage again, he said in 2005, he would include that scene.

Another issue is why France 2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene directly after the shooting, including the shooting death of the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.

Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up Jamal and Muhammad together, but he did not film any of it. When Esther Schapira asked why not, he replied: "Because when the ambulance came it closed on them, you know?" When asked why he had not filmed the ambulance arriving and leaving, he replied that he had only one battery. Enderlin reportedly told the Paris Court of Appeal that Abu Rahma changed batteries at that point. Enderlin wrote in 2008 that "footage filmed by a cameraman under fire is not the equivalent of a surveillance camera in a supermarket." Abu Rahma "filmed what circumstances permitted."

In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French journalists to view the raw footage—<a href="Denis%20Jeambar">Denis Jeambar</a>, editor-in-chief of "L'Express"; Daniel Leconte, former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and Luc Rosenzweig, former editor-in-chief of "Le Monde". They also asked to speak to the cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.

Jeambar and Leconte wrote a report about the viewing for "Le Figaro" in January 2005. None of the scenes showed that the boy had died, they wrote. They rejected the position that the scene had been staged, but when Enderlin's voiceover said Muhammad was dead, Enderlin "had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead, and even less so, that he had been shot by IDF soldiers." They said the footage did not show the boy's death throes: "This famous 'agonie' that Enderlin insisted was cut from the montage does not exist."

Several minutes of the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away. A France 2 official told them, "You know it's always like that," a comment that Leconte said he found disturbing given the controversy. Christine Delavennat, France 2's communications director, said that none of the scenes in the footage had been staged. Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets. Leconte said in an interview: "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." He dismissed France 2's explanation—that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything."

The idea of writing about the raw footage had been Luc Rosenzweig's; he had initially offered a story about it to "L'Express", which is how Jeambar (editor of "L'Express") had become involved. But Jeambar and Leconte ended up distancing themselves from Rosenzweig. He was involved with the Israeli-French Metula News Agency (known as Mena), which was pushing the view that the scene was a fake. Rosenzweig later called it "an almost perfect media crime." When Jeambar and Leconte wrote up their report about the raw footage, they initially offered it "Le Monde", not "Le Figaro", but "Le Monde" refused to publish it because Mena had been involved at an earlier stage. Jeambar and Leconte made clear in "Le Figaro" that they gave no credence to the staging hypothesis:
To those who, like Mena, tried to use us to support the theory that the child's death was staged by the Palestinians, we say they are misleading us and their readers. Not only do we not share that point of view, but we attest that, given our present knowledge of the case, nothing supports that conclusion. In fact, the reverse is true."

Enderlin responded to Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in "Le Figaro". He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had reported that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.

Another reason he had attributed the shooting to Israel, he wrote, was that "the image corresponded to the reality of the situation not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank." Citing Ben Kaspi in the Israeli newspaper "Maariv", he wrote that, during the first months of the Second Intifada, the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition—700,000 in the West Bank and 300,000 in Gaza; from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians had been killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.

Confusion arose about the timeline. The cameraman said the shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes. Jamal's account matched his: he and Muhammad arrived at the junction around noon, and were under fire for 45 minutes.

Enderlin's France 2 report placed the shooting later in the day. His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3:00 pm local time (GMT+3). James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3:00 pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene. Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting. According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where he sent the footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm. The news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.

Contradicting the noon and 3 pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, the doctor who admitted Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00 am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later said that he could not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr. Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.

In 2002 Schapira interviewed three anonymous Israeli soldiers, "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," who said they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something was about to happen, one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres to the left of the al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.

In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at <a href="Sheba%20Medical%20Center">Tel Hashomer hospital</a> near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a "Daniel Vavinsky," published in 2008 in "Actualité Juive" in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the <a href="Tribunal%20de%20grande%20instance%20de%20Paris">Tribunal de grande instance de Paris</a> for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.

The court established that "Daniel Vavinsky" was a pseudonym for , a deputy editor at <a href="France%203">France 3</a>. In 2011 it ruled that David and "Actualité Juive" had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of "Actualité Juive", were fined €5,000 each, and "Actualité Juive" was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.

In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of <a href="Physicians%20for%20Human%20Rights">Physicians for Human Rights</a>, wrote in "Haaretz" that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were "completely different wounds" from the 1994 injuries. Walden listed "a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg."

Major General <a href="Yom%20Tov%20Samia">Yom Tov Samia</a>, the IDF's southern commander, set up an inquiry soon after the shooting. According to James Fallows, Israeli commentators questioned its legitimacy as soon as it started; "Haaretz" called it "almost a pirate endeavour." The team was led by <a href="Nahum%20Shahaf">Nahum Shahaf</a>, a physicist, and Joseph Doriel, an engineer, both of whom had been involved in the <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin%20assassination%20conspiracy%20theories">Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories</a>. Other investigators included Meir Danino, chief scientist at Elisra Systems; Bernie Schechter, a ballistics expert, formerly with the Israeli police's criminal identification laboratory; and Chief Superintendent Elliot Springer, also from the criminal identification lab. A full list of names was never released.

Shahaf and Doriel built models of the wall, concrete drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots may have come from a position behind the France 2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.

On 23 October 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" to film the reenactment. Doriel told the correspondent, <a href="Bob%20Simon">Bob Simon</a>, that he believed the boy's death was real, but that it had been set up to damage Israel. Those in the know, he said, included the cameraman and the boy's father, though the latter had not realized the boy would be killed. When General Samia heard about the interview, he removed Doriel from the investigation. The investigators' report was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence; the key points were published in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as "quite plausible" that he had been hit by Palestinian bullets aimed at the IDF post. The inquiry provoked widespread criticism. A "Haaretz" editorial said, "it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of this bizarre investigation."

In 2005 Major-General Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF's admission of responsibility, and a statement to that effect was approved by the prime minister's office in September 2007. The following year an IDF spokesman, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom, said that the Shahaf report had shown the IDF could not have shot Muhammad. He asked France 2 to send the IDF the unedited 27 minutes of raw footage, as well as footage the France 2 cameraman shot the following day.

In September 2012 the Israeli government set up another inquiry at the request of Prime Minister <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not been hit by IDF fire and may not have been shot at all.

The Kuperwasser report said that France 2's central claims were not substantiated by the material the station had in its possession at the time; that the boy was alive at the end of the video; that there was no evidence that Jamal or Muhammad were injured in the manner reported by France 2 or that Jamal was seriously injured; and that they may not have been shot at all. It included a medical opinion from Yehuda David, the doctor who treated Jamal in 1994. The report said it is "highly doubtful that bullet holes in the vicinity of the two could have had their source in fire from the Israeli position," and that the France 2 report was "edited and narrated in such a way as to create the misleading impression that it substantiated the claims made therein." The France 2 narrative relied entirely on the cameraman's opinion, the report said. <a href="Yuval%20Steinitz">Yuval Steinitz</a>, Minister of International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence, called the affair a "modern-day <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a> against the State of Israel."

France 2, Charles Enderlin and Jamal al-Durrah rejected the report's conclusions and said they would cooperate with an independent international investigation. France 2 and Enderlin asked the Israeli government to supply the commission's letter of appointment, membership and evidence, including photographs and the names of witnesses. Enderlin said the commission had failed to speak to him, France 2, al-Durrah or other eyewitnesses, and had consulted no independent experts. According to Enderlin, France 2 stood ready to help al-Durrah have his son's body exhumed; he and al-Durrah said they were willing to take <a href="polygraph%20test">polygraph test</a>s.

In response to claims that it had broadcast a staged scene, Enderlin and France 2 filed three defamation suits in 2004 and 2005, seeking symbolic damages of <a href="Euro">€</a>1. The most notable lawsuit was against <a href="Philippe%20Karsenty">Philippe Karsenty</a>, who ran a media watchdog, Media-Ratings. He published an analysis of the footage on his website in November 2004, based on work from the French-Israeli Metula News Agency, that alleged the shooting scene had been faked, as had several scenes leading up to it where protesters were shown being injured. France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.

The case began in September 2006. Enderlin submitted as evidence a February 2004 letter from <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a>, then president of France, which spoke of Enderlin's integrity. The court upheld the complaint on 19 October 2006, fining Karsenty €1,000 and ordering him to pay €3,000 in costs. He lodged an appeal that day.

The first appeal opened in September 2007 in the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20Paris">Court of Appeal of Paris</a>, before a three-judge panel led by Judge Laurence Trébucq. The court asked France 2 to turn over the 27 minutes of raw footage the cameraman said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France 2 produced 18 minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.
During the screening, the court heard that Muhammad had raised his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.

France 2's lawyer, , counsel to former President of France <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a>, called Karsenty "the Jew who pays a second Jew to pay a third Jew to fight to the last drop of Israeli blood," comparing him to 9/11 conspiracy theorist <a href="Thierry%20Meyssan">Thierry Meyssan</a> and Holocaust denier <a href="Robert%20Faurisson">Robert Faurisson</a>. Karsenty had it in for Enderlin, Szpiner argued, because of Enderlin's even-handed coverage of the Middle East.

The judges overturned the ruling against Karsenty in May 2008 in a 13-page decision. They ruled that he had exercised in good faith his right to criticize and had shown the court a "coherent body of evidence." The court noted inconsistencies in Enderlin's statements and said that the cameraman's statements were not "perfectly credible either in form or content." There were calls for a public inquiry from historian <a href="%C3%89lie%20Barnavi">Élie Barnavi</a>, a former Israeli ambassador to France, and Richard Prasquier, president of the "<a href="Conseil%20Repr%C3%A9sentatif%20des%20Institutions%20juives%20de%20France">Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France</a>". The left-leaning "<a href="Le%20Nouvel%20Observateur">Le Nouvel Observateur</a>" began a petition in support of Enderlin that was signed by 300 French writers, accusing Karsenty of a seven-year smear campaign.

France 2 appealed to the <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28France%29">Court of Cassation</a> (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the decision of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that the court should not have asked France 2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.

The footage of Muhammad was compared to other iconic images of children under attack: the (1943), the doused with napalm (1972), and the in Oklahoma (1995). , a French journalist, argued that Muhammad's death "cancels, erases that of the Jewish child, his hands in the air before the SS in the Warsaw Ghetto."

Palestinian children were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage, according to a therapist in Gaza, and were re-enacting the scene in playgrounds. Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images. Parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honour, and <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> mentioned him in a "warning" to President George Bush after 9/11. The images were blamed for the <a href="2000%20Ramallah%20lynching">2000 Ramallah lynching</a> and a rise in antisemitism in France. One image could be seen in the background when journalist <a href="Daniel%20Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a>, an American Jew, was beheaded by al-Qaeda in February 2002.

Sections of the Jewish and Israeli communities, including the Israeli government in 2013, described the statements that IDF soldiers had killed the boy as a "blood libel," a reference to the <a href="blood%20libel">centuries-old allegation that Jews sacrifice Christian children for their blood</a>. Comparisons were made with the <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus affair</a> of 1894, when a French-Jewish army captain was found guilty of treason based on a forgery. In the view of Charles Enderlin, the controversy is a smear campaign intended to undermine footage coming out of the occupied Palestinian territories. Doreen Carvjal wrote in "The New York Times" that the footage is "a cultural prism, with viewers seeing what they want to see."

Baryonyx

Baryonyx () is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> which lived in the <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> <a href="Geological%20stage">stage</a> of the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 130–125 million years ago. The first skeleton was discovered in 1983 in the <a href="Weald%20Clay%20Formation">Weald Clay Formation</a> of <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England, and became the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of B. walkeri, named by <a href="palaeontologists">palaeontologists</a> <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> and <a href="Angela%20C.%20Milner">Angela C. Milner</a> in <a href="1986%20in%20paleontology">1986</a>. The generic name, "Baryonyx", means "heavy claw" and alludes to the animal's very large claw on the first finger; the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "walkeri", refers to its discoverer, amateur <a href="fossil%20collector">fossil collector</a> William J. Walker. The holotype specimen is one of the most complete theropod skeletons from the UK (and remains the most complete spinosaurid), and its discovery attracted media attention. Specimens later discovered in other parts of the United Kingdom and <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a> have also been assigned to the genus.

The holotype specimen, which may not have been fully grown, was estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between . "Baryonyx" had a long, low, and narrow snout, which has been compared to that of a <a href="gharial">gharial</a>. The tip of the snout expanded to the sides in the shape of a <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a>. Behind this, the upper jaw had a notch which fitted into the lower jaw (which curved upwards in the same area). It had a triangular <a href="Sagittal%20crest">crest</a> on the top of its <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a>. "Baryonyx" had a large number of finely serrated, conical teeth, with the largest teeth in front. The neck formed an S-shape, and the <a href="neural%20spines">neural spines</a> of its <a href="dorsal%20vertebrae">dorsal vertebrae</a> increased in height from front to back. One elongated neural spine indicates it may have had a hump or ridge along the centre of its back. It had robust forelimbs, with the eponymous first-finger claw measuring about long.

Now recognised as a member of the family <a href="Spinosauridae">Spinosauridae</a>, "Baryonyx" affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Some researchers have suggested that "<a href="Suchosaurus%20cultridens">Suchosaurus cultridens</a>" is a <a href="senior%20synonym">senior synonym</a> (being an older name), and that "<a href="Suchomimus%20tenerensis">Suchomimus tenerensis</a>" belongs in the same genus; subsequent authors have kept them separate. "Baryonyx" was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been <a href="piscivore">piscivorous</a> (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>". The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. "Baryonyx" may have had <a href="semiaquatic">semiaquatic</a> habits, and coexisted with other theropod, <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a>, and <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> dinosaurs, as well as <a href="pterosaurs">pterosaurs</a>, <a href="crocodiles">crocodiles</a>, turtles and fishes, in a <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> environment.

In January 1983 the British plumber and amateur <a href="fossil%20collector">fossil collector</a> William J. Walker explored the <a href="Smokejack%20Clay%20Pit">Smokejacks Pit</a>, a <a href="clay%20pit">clay pit</a> in the <a href="Weald%20Clay%20Formation">Weald Clay Formation</a> near <a href="Ockley">Ockley</a> in Surrey, England. He found a rock wherein he discovered a large claw, but after piecing it together at home, he realised the tip of the claw was missing. Walker returned to the same spot in the pit some weeks later, and found the missing part after searching for an hour. He also found a <a href="phalanx%20bone">phalanx bone</a> and part of a rib. Walker's son-in-law later brought the claw to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20London">Natural History Museum of London</a>, where it was examined by the British <a href="palaeontologists">palaeontologists</a> <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> and <a href="Angela%20C.%20Milner">Angela C. Milner</a>, who identified it as belonging to a <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaur. The palaeontologists found more bone fragments at the site in February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to weather conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated of <a href="Matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a> in 54 blocks over a three-week period. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.

Most of the bones collected were encased in <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodules</a> surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were and scattered over a 5 x 2 m (17 x 8 ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a>, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix and the presence of <a href="siderite">siderite</a>; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. It took six years of almost constant preparation to get all the bones out of the rock, and by the end, <a href="dental%20tools">dental tools</a> and <a href="air%20mallet">air mallet</a>s had to be used under a microscope. The specimen represents about 65 percent of the skeleton, and consists of partial skull bones, including <a href="premaxillae">premaxillae</a> (first bones of the upper jaw); the left <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (second bone of the upper jaw); <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a>; the left <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>; the left <a href="prefrontal%20bone">prefrontal bone</a>; the left <a href="postorbital%20bone">postorbital bone</a>; the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> including the <a href="occiput">occiput</a>; <a href="dentary%20bones">dentary bones</a> (the front bones of the lower jaw); various bones from the back of the lower jaw; teeth; <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a> (neck), <a href="dorsal%20vertebrae">dorsal</a> (back), and caudal (tail) vertebrae; ribs; a <a href="sternum">sternum</a>; both <a href="scapulae">scapulae</a> (shoulder blades); both <a href="coracoids">coracoids</a>; both <a href="humeri">humeri</a> (upper arm bones); left <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> (lower arm bones); finger bones and <a href="unguals">unguals</a> (claw bones); hip bones; upper end of the left <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) and lower end of the right; right <a href="fibula">fibula</a> (of the lower leg); and foot bones including an ungual. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.

In <a href="1986%20in%20paleontology">1986</a>, Charig and Milner named a new <a href="genus">genus</a> and <a href="species">species</a> with the skeleton as <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a>: "Baryonyx walkeri". The generic name derives from <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a>; βαρύς ("barys") means "heavy" or "strong", and ὄνυξ ("onyx") means "claw" or "talon". The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honours Walker, for discovering the specimen. At that time, the authors did not know if the large claw belonged to the hand or the foot (as in <a href="dromaeosaurs">dromaeosaurs</a>, which it was then assumed to be). The dinosaur had been presented earlier the same year during a lecture at a conference about dinosaur systematics in <a href="Drumheller">Drumheller</a>. Due to ongoing work on the bones (70 percent had been prepared at the time), they called their article preliminary and promised a more detailed description at a later date. "Baryonyx" was the first large <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> theropod found anywhere in the world by that time. Before the discovery of "Baryonyx" the last significant theropod find in the United Kingdom was "<a href="Eustreptospondylus">Eustreptospondylus</a>" in 1871, and in a 1986 interview Charig called "Baryonyx" "the best find of the century" in Europe. "Baryonyx" was widely featured in international media, and was nicknamed "Claws" by journalists <a href="pun">pun</a>ning on the title of the film "<a href="Jaws%20%28film%29">Jaws</a>". Its discovery was the subject of a 1987 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary, and a cast of the skeleton is mounted at the Natural History Museum in London. In 1997, Charig and Milner published a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> describing the holotype skeleton in detail. The holotype specimen remains the most completely known <a href="spinosaurid">spinosaurid</a> skeleton.

Fossils from other parts of the UK and <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a>, mostly isolated teeth, have subsequently been attributed to "Baryonyx" or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, including hand bones reported in 1998 and a vertebra reported by the British palaeontologists Steve Hutt and Penny Newbery in 2004, have been attributed to this genus. In 2017, the British palaeontologist Martin C. Munt and colleagues reported cranial remains of two "Baryonyx" individuals from the Isle of Wight, and stated they would be examined and described in the future. A maxilla fragment from <a href="La%20Rioja%20%28Spain%29">La Rioja, Spain</a>, was attributed to "Baryonyx" by the Spanish palaeontologists Luis I. Viera and José Angel Torres in 1995 (although the American palaeontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz">Thomas R. Holtz</a> and colleagues raised the possibility that it could have belonged to "Suchomimus" in 2004). In 1999, a postorbital bone, a <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>, a tooth, vertebral remains, <a href="metacarpals">metacarpals</a>, and a phalanx from the Sala de los Infantes deposit in <a href="Burgos%20%28province%29">Burgos Province</a>, Spain, were attributed to an immature "Baryonyx" (though some of these elements are unknown in the holotype) by the Spanish palaeontologist Carolina Fuentes Vidarte and colleagues. Dinosaur tracks near Burgos have also been suggested to belong to "Baryonyx" or a similar theropod. In 2011, a specimen (<a href="Museu%20da%20Lourinh%C3%A3">ML</a>1190) from the <a href="Papo%20Seco%20Formation">Papo Seco Formation</a> in <a href="Boca%20do%20Chapim">Boca do Chapim</a>, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a scapula, and a phalanx bone, was attributed to "Baryonyx" by the Portuguese palaeontologist <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Mateus">Octávio Mateus</a> and colleagues, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype (which was of similar size), except for the mid-neck vertebrae. In 2018, the British palaeontologist Thomas M. S. Arden and colleagues found that the Portuguese skeleton did not belong to "Baryonyx", since the front of its dentary bone was not strongly upturned. Some additional spinosaurid remains from Iberia appear to belong to taxa other than "Baryonyx".

In 2003, Milner noted that some teeth at the Natural History Museum previously identified as belonging to the genera "<a href="Suchosaurus">Suchosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" probably belonged to "Baryonyx". The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Suchosaurus", "S. cultridens", was named by the British biologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> in 1841, based on teeth discovered by the British geologist <a href="Gideon%20A.%20Mantell">Gideon A. Mantell</a> in <a href="Tilgate%20Forest">Tilgate Forest</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. Owen originally thought the teeth to have belonged to a <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>; he was yet to name the group <a href="Dinosauria">Dinosauria</a>, which happened the following year. A second species, "S. girardi", was named by the French palaeontologist <a href="Henri%20%C3%89mile%20Sauvage">Henri Émile Sauvage</a> in 1897, based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim, Portugal. In 2007, the French palaeontologist <a href="%C3%89ric%20Buffetaut">Éric Buffetaut</a> considered the teeth of "S. girardi" very similar to those of "Baryonyx" (and "S. cultridens") except for the stronger development of the <a href="tooth%20crown">tooth crown</a> flutes (or "ribs"; lengthwise ridges), suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of "S. cultridens" were almost identical to those of "B. walkeri", but with a ribbier surface. The former <a href="taxon">taxon</a> might be a <a href="senior%20synonym">senior synonym</a> of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of "S. cultridens" is a single tooth and that of "B. walkeri" is a skeleton, it would be more practical to retain the newer name. In 2011, Mateus and colleagues agreed that "Suchosaurus" was closely related to "Baryonyx", but considered both species in the former genus "<a href="nomina%20dubia">nomina dubia</a>" (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa. In any case, the identification of "Suchosaurus" as a spinosaurid makes it the first named member of the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>.

In 1997, Charig and Milner noted that two fragmentary spinosaurid snouts from the <a href="Elrhaz%20Formation">Elrhaz Formation</a> of Niger (reported by the French palaeontologist <a href="Philippe%20Taquet">Philippe Taquet</a> in 1984) were similar enough to "Baryonyx" that they considered them to belong to an indeterminate species of the genus (despite their much younger <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> geological age). In 1998, these fossils became the basis of the genus and species "<a href="Cristatusaurus%20lapparenti">Cristatusaurus lapparenti</a>", named by Taquet and the American palaeontologist <a href="Dale%20Russell">Dale Russell</a>. The American palaeontologist <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> and colleagues named the new genus and species "<a href="Suchomimus%20tenerensis">Suchomimus tenerensis</a>" later in 1998, based on more complete fossils from the Elrhaz Formation. In 2002, the German palaeontologist <a href="Hans-Dieter%20Sues">Hans-Dieter Sues</a> and colleagues proposed that "Suchomimus tenerensis" was similar enough to "Baryonyx walkeri" to be considered a species within the same genus (as "B. tenerensis"), and that "Suchomimus" was identical to "Cristatusaurus". Milner concurred that the material from Niger was indistinguishable from "Baryonyx" in 2003. In a 2004 <a href="conference%20abstract">conference abstract</a>, Hutt and Newberry supported the synonymy based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to an animal closely related to "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus". Later studies have kept "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus" separate, whereas "Cristatusaurus" has been proposed to be either a "nomen dubium" or possibly distinct from both. A 2017 <a href="review%20paper">review paper</a> by the Brazilian palaeontologist Carlos Roberto A. Candeiro and colleagues stated that this debate was more in the realm of semantics than science, as it is generally agreed that "B. walkeri" and "S. tenerensis" are distinct, related species.

"Baryonyx" is estimated to have been between long, in hip height, and to have weighed between . The fact that elements of the skull and <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a> of the "B. walkeri" holotype specimen (NHM R9951) do not appear to have <a href="co-ossified">co-ossified</a> (fused) suggests that the individual was not fully grown, and the mature animal may have been much larger (as is the case for some other spinosaurids). On the other hand, the specimen's fused sternum indicates that it may have been mature.

The skull of "Baryonyx" is incompletely known, and much of the middle and hind portions are not preserved. The full length of the skull is estimated to have been long, based on comparison with that of the related genus "Suchomimus" (which was 20% larger). It was elongated, and the front 170 mm (6.6 in) of the premaxillae formed a long, narrow, and low snout (<a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a>) with a smoothly rounded upper surface. The (bony nostrils) were long, low, and placed far back from the snout tip. The front 130 mm (5.1 in) of the snout expanded into a spatulate (spoon-like), "terminal <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a>", a shape similar to the rostrum of the modern <a href="gharial">gharial</a>. The front 70 mm (2.7 in) of the lower margin of the premaxillae was downturned (or hooked), whereas that of the front portion of the maxillae was upturned. This <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> resulted in a <a href="Sigmoid%20function">sigmoid</a> or S shaped margin of the lower upper tooth row, in which the teeth from the front of the maxilla were projecting forward. The snout was particularly narrow directly behind the rosette; this area received the large teeth of the mandible. The maxilla and premaxilla of "Baryonyx" fit together in a complex <a href="Joint">articulation</a>, and the resulting gap between the upper and lower jaw is known as the . A downturned premaxilla and a sigmoid lower margin of the upper tooth row was also present in distantly related theropods such as "<a href="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a>". The snout had extensive pits (which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves), and the maxilla appears to have housed <a href="sinuses">sinuses</a>.

"Baryonyx" had a rudimentary <a href="secondary%20palate">secondary palate</a>, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests the presence of a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. The nasal bones were fused, which distinguished "Baryonyx" from other spinosaurids, and a <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> was present above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasals. This crest was triangular, narrow, and sharp in its front part, and was distinct from those of other spinosaurids in ending hind wards in a cross-shaped process. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, in "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", and was distinct from other spinosaurids in being solid and almost triangular. The was narrow, with the paroccipital processes pointing outwards horizontally, and the were lengthened, descending far below the <a href="basioccipital">basioccipital</a> (the lowermost bone of the occiput). Sereno and colleagues suggested that some of "Baryonyx" cranial bones had been misidentified by Charig and Milner, resulting in the occiput being reconstructed as too deep, and that the skull was instead probably as low, long and narrow as that of "Suchomimus". The front 140 mm (5.5 in) of the dentary in the mandible sloped upwards towards the curve of the snout. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent <a href="Meckelian%20groove">Meckelian groove</a> on the inner side. The <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a>, where the two halves of the lower jaw connected at the front, was particularly short. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels.

Most of the teeth found with the holotype specimen were not in articulation with the skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were still borne by the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, where slightly flattened from sideways, and their curvature was almost uniform. The roots were very long, and tapered towards their extremity. The carinae (sharp front and back edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> on the front and back, and extended all along the crown. There were around six to eight denticles per millimetre (0.039 in), a much larger number than in large-bodied theropods like "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, while others bore no flutes; their presence is probably related to position or <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> (developing during growth). The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large compared to most other theropods, with six to seven teeth in each premaxilla and thirty-two in each dentary. Based on the closer packing and smaller size of the dentary teeth compared to those in the corresponding length of the premaxilla, the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws appears to have been more pronounced than in other theropods. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw of the holotype had thirteen <a href="dental%20alveoli">dental alveoli</a> (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side, showing tooth count asymmetry. The first four upper teeth were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Small subtriangular <a href="interdental%20plates">interdental plates</a> were present between the alveoli.

Initially thought to have lacked the sigmoid curve typical of theropods, the neck of "Baryonyx" does appear to have formed an S shape, though straighter than in other theropods. The cervical vertebrae of the neck tapered towards the head and became progressively longer front to back. Their <a href="zygapophyses">zygapophyses</a> (the processes that connected the vertebrae) were flat, and their <a href="epipophyses">epipophyses</a> (processes to which neck muscles attached) were well developed. The <a href="axis%20vertebra">axis vertebra</a> (the second neck vertebra) was small relative to the size of the skull and had a well-developed <a href="Hyposphene-hypantrum%20articulation">hyposphene</a>. The <a href="neural%20arches">neural arches</a> of the cervical vertebrae was not always <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">sutured</a> to the centra (the <a href="bodies%20of%20the%20vertebrae">bodies of the vertebrae</a>), and the <a href="neural%20spines">neural spines</a> there were low and thin. The <a href="cervical%20ribs">cervical ribs</a> were short, similar to those of crocodiles, and possibly overlapped each other somewhat. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae of the back were similar in size. Like in other theropods, the skeleton of "Baryonyx" showed <a href="skeletal%20pneumaticity">skeletal pneumaticity</a>, reducing its weight through <a href="fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> (openings) in the neural arches and (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the <a href="Vertebra%23Structure">transverse processes</a>). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad. One isolated dorsal neural spine was moderately elongated and slender, indicating that "Baryonyx" may have had a hump or ridge along the centre of its back (though incipiently developed compared to those of other spinosaurids). "Baryonyx" was unique among spinosaurids in having a marked constriction from side to side in a vertebra that either belonged to the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> or front of the tail.

The coracoid tapered hind-wards when viewed in profile, and, uniquely among spinosaurids, connected with the scapula in a peg-and-notch articulation. The scapulae were robust and the bones of the forelimb were short in relation to the animal's size, but broad and sturdy. The humerus was short and stout, with its ends broadly expanded and flattened—the upper side for the and muscle attachment and the lower for articulation with the radius and ulna. The radius was short, stout and straight, and less than half the length of the humerus, while the ulna was a little longer. The ulna had a powerful and an expanded lower end. The hands had three fingers; the first finger bore a large claw measuring about along its curve in the holotype specimen. The claw would have been lengthened by a <a href="keratin">keratin</a> (horny) sheath in life. Apart from its size, the claw's proportions were fairly typical of a theropod, i.e. it was <a href="bilaterally%20symmetric">bilaterally symmetric</a>, slightly compressed, smoothly rounded, and sharply pointed. A groove for the sheath ran along the length of the claw. The other claws of the hand were much smaller. The <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> (main hip bone) of the pelvis had a prominent , an anterior process that was slender and vertically expanded, and a posterior process that was long and straight. The ilium also had a prominent and a deep grove that faced downwards. The (the socket for the femur) was long from front to back. The <a href="ischium">ischium</a> (lower and rearmost hip bone) had a well developed at the upper part. The margin of the <a href="pubic">pubic</a> blade at the lower end was turned outward, and the pubic foot was not expanded. The femur lacked a groove on the fibular condyle, and, uniquely among spinosaurids, the fibula had a very shallow fibular <a href="Fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossa</a> (depression).

In their original description, Charig and Milner found "Baryonyx" unique enough to warrant a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found "Baryonyx" to be unlike any other theropod group, and considered the possibility that it was a <a href="thecodont">thecodont</a> (a grouping of early <a href="archosaurs">archosaurs</a> now considered <a href="paraphyly">unnatural</a>), due to having apparently <a href="Primitive%20%28phylogenetics%29">primitive</a> features, but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in "Dilophosaurus". They also noted that the two snouts from Niger (which later became the basis of "Cristatusaurus"), assigned to the family <a href="Spinosauridae">Spinosauridae</a> by Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to that of "Baryonyx" and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, the American palaeontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> agreed with Taquet that "Spinosaurus", described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt that were destroyed in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and "Baryonyx" were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990, Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of "Baryonyx", since they did not find their remains similar enough. In 1997, they agreed that Baryonychidae and Spinosauridae were related, but disagreed that the former name should become a synonym of the latter, because the completeness of "Baryonyx" compared to "Spinosaurus" made it a better <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a> for a family, and because they did not find the similarities between the two significant enough. Holtz and colleagues listed Baryonychidae as a synonym of Spinosauridae in 2004.

Discoveries in the 1990s shed more light on the relationships of "Baryonyx" and its relatives. In 1996, a snout from Morocco was referred to "Spinosaurus", and "<a href="Irritator">Irritator</a>" and "Angaturama" from Brazil (the two are possible synonyms) were named. "Cristatusaurus" and "Suchomimus" were named based on fossils from Niger in 1998. In their description of "Suchomimus", Sereno and colleagues placed it and "Baryonyx" in the new <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Baryonychinae">Baryonychinae</a> within Spinosauridae; "Spinosaurus" and "Irritator" were placed in the subfamily <a href="Spinosaurinae">Spinosaurinae</a>. Baryonychinae was distinguished by the small size and larger number of teeth in the dentary behind the terminal rosette, the deeply keeled front dorsal vertebrae, and by having serrated teeth. Spinosaurinae was distinguished by their straight tooth crowns without serrations, small first tooth in the premaxilla, increased spacing of teeth in the jaws, and possibly by having their nostrils placed further back and the presence of a deep <a href="neural%20spine%20sail">neural spine sail</a>. They also united the spinosaurids and their closest relatives in the superfamily Spinosauroidea, but in 2010, the British palaeontologist Roger Benson considered this a junior synonym of <a href="Megalosauroidea">Megalosauroidea</a> (an older name). In a 2007 conference abstract, the American palaeontologist Denver W. Fowler suggested that since "Suchosaurus" is the first named genus in its group, the clade names Spinosauroidea, Spinosauridae, and Baryonychinae should be replaced by Suchosauroidea, Suchosauridae, and Suchosaurinae, regardless of whether or not the name "Baryonyx" is retained. A 2017 study by the Brazilian palaeontologists Marcos A. F. Sales and Cesar L. Schultz found that the clade Baryonychinae was not well supported, since serrated teeth may be an <a href="ancestral%20trait">ancestral trait</a> among spinosaurids. 

The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the position of "Baryonyx" within Spinosauridae, after Ronan Allain and colleagues, 2012:

Spinosaurids appear to have been widespread from the <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> to the <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> <a href="geological%20stage">stages</a> of the Cretaceous, about 130 to 95 million years ago, while the oldest known spinosaurid remains date to the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a>. They shared features such as long, narrow, crocodile-like skulls; sub-circular teeth, with fine to no serrations; the terminal rosette of the snout; and a secondary palate that made them more resistant to torsion. In contrast, the primitive and typical condition for theropods was a tall, narrow snout with blade-like (ziphodont) teeth with serrated carinae. The skull adaptations of spinosaurids <a href="Convergent%20evolution">converged</a> with those of <a href="crocodilian">crocodilian</a>s; early members of the latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods, later developing elongated snouts, conical teeth, and secondary palates. These adaptations may have been the result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish. Unlike crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of baryonychine spinosaurids do not appear to have aquatic adaptations. Sereno and colleagues proposed in 1998 that the large thumb-claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in the Middle Jurassic, before the elongation of the skull and other adaptations related to fish-eating, since the former features are shared with their <a href="megalosaurid">megalosaurid</a> relatives. They also suggested that the spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous.

Several theories have been proposed about the <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> of the spinosaurids. Since "Suchomimus" was more closely related to "Baryonyx" (from Europe) than to "Spinosaurus"—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as <a href="vicariance">vicariance</a> resulting from <a href="continental%20rifting">continental rifting</a>. Sereno and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Pangea">Pangea</a>, but split with the opening of the <a href="Tethys%20Sea">Tethys Sea</a>. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>), with "Suchomimus" the result of a single north-to-south <a href="dispersal%20event">dispersal event</a>. Buffetaut and the Tunisian palaeontologist Mohamed Ouaja also suggested in 2002 that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. Milner suggested in 2003 that spinosaurids originated in Laurasia during the Jurassic, and dispersed via the Iberian <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> into Gondwana, where they <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a>. In 2007, Buffetaut pointed out that <a href="palaeogeographical">palaeogeographical</a> studies had demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous, which he found to confirm Milner's idea that the Iberian region was a <a href="Island%20hopping">stepping stone</a> between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and Australia indicate that it may have been complex.

In 2016, the Spanish palaeontologist Alejandro Serrano-Martínez and colleagues reported the oldest known spinosaurid fossil, a tooth from the Middle Jurassic of Niger, which they found to suggest that spinosaurids originated in Gondwana, since other known Jurassic spinosaurid teeth are also from Africa, but they found the subsequent dispersal routes unclear. Candeiro and colleagues suggested in 2017 that spinosaurids of northern Gondwana were replaced by other predators, such as <a href="abelisauroids">abelisauroids</a>, since no definite spinosaurid fossils are known from after the Cenomanian anywhere in the world. They attributed the disappearance of spinosaurids and other shifts in the fauna of Gondwana to changes in the environment, perhaps caused by <a href="Marine%20transgression">transgressions in sea level</a>.

In 1986, Charig and Milner suggested that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that "Baryonyx" was <a href="piscivore">piscivorous</a> (fish-eating), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to <a href="Fishing%20gaff">gaff</a> fish out of the water (similar to the modern <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>). Two years earlier, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were similar to those of the modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to <a href="herons">herons</a> or <a href="storks">storks</a>. In 1987, the Scottish biologist Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of "Baryonyx" and suggested that it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that "Baryonyx" jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to the Irish palaeontologist Robin E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).

In 1997, Charig and Milner demonstrated direct dietary evidence in the stomach region of the "B. walkeri" holotype. It contained the first evidence of piscivory in a theropod dinosaur, acid-etched scales and teeth of the common fish "<a href="Scheenstia%20mantelli">Scheenstia mantelli</a>" (then classified in the genus "<a href="Lepidotes">Lepidotes</a>"), and abraded bones of a young "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>". An apparent <a href="gastrolith">gastrolith</a> (<a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> stone) was also found. They also presented circumstantial evidence for piscivory, such as crocodile-like adaptations for catching and swallowing prey: long, narrow jaws with their "terminal rosette", similar to those of a gharial, and the downturned tip and notch of the snout. In their view, these adaptations suggested that "Baryonyx" would have caught small to medium-sized fish in the manner of a crocodilian: gripping them with the notch of the snout (giving the teeth a "stabbing function"), tilting the head backwards, and swallowing them headfirst. Larger fish would be broken up with the claws. That the teeth in the lower jaw were smaller, more crowded and numerous than those in the upper jaw may have helped the animal grip food. Charig and Milner maintained that "Baryonyx" would primarily have eaten fish (although it would also have been an active predator and opportunistic scavenger), but it was not equipped to be a <a href="macro-predator">macro-predator</a> like "Allosaurus". They suggested that "Baryonyx" mainly used its forelimbs and large claws to catch, kill and tear apart larger prey. In 2004, a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth embedded in it reported by Buffetaut and colleagues confirmed that the latter were not exclusively piscivorous.

A 2007 <a href="Finite%20element%20method">finite element analysis</a> of <a href="CT%20scanned">CT scanned</a> snouts by the British palaeontologist Emily J. Rayfield and colleagues indicated that the <a href="biomechanics">biomechanics</a> of "Baryonyx" were most similar to those of the gharial and unlike those of the <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a> and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli%20beam%20theory">beam-theory</a> study by the British palaeontologists Andrew R. Cuff and Rayfield compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of "Baryonyx" and "Spinosaurus" similar in their resistance to bending and torsion. "Baryonyx" was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with "Spinosaurus" and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that "Baryonyx" performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size. A preceding 2005 beam-theory study by the Canadian palaeontologist François Therrien and colleagues was unable to reconstruct force profiles of "Baryonyx", but found that the related "Suchomimus" would have used the front part of its jaws to capture prey, and suggested that the jaws of spinosaurids were adapted for hunting smaller terrestrial prey in addition to fish. They envisaged that spinosaurids could have captured smaller prey with the rosette of teeth at the front of the jaws, and finished it by shaking it. Larger prey would instead have been captured and killed with their forelimbs instead of their bite, since their skulls would not be able to resist the bending stress. They also agreed that the conical teeth of spinosaurids were well-developed for impaling and holding prey, with their shape enabling them to withstand bending loads from all directions.

In a 2014 conference abstract, the American palaeontologist Danny Anduza and Fowler pointed out that grizzly bears do not gaff fish out of the water as was suggested for "Baryonyx", and also ruled out that the dinosaur would not have darted its head like herons, since the necks of spinosaurids were not strongly S-curved, and their eyes were not well-positioned for <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a>. Instead, they suggested the jaws would have made sideways sweeps to catch fish, like the gharial, with the hand claws probably used to stamp down and impale large fish, whereafter they manipulated them with their jaws, in a manner similar to grizzly bears and <a href="fishing%20cats">fishing cats</a>. They did not find the teeth of spinosaurids suitable for dismembering prey, due to their lack of serrations, and suggested they would have swallowed prey whole (while noting they could also have used their claws for dismemberment). A 2016 study by the Belgian palaeontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found that adult spinosaurs could displace their mandibular rami (halves of the lower jaw) sideways when the jaw was depressed, which allowed the <a href="pharynx">pharynx</a> (opening that connects the mouth to the <a href="oesophagus">oesophagus</a>) to be widened. This jaw-articulation is similar to that seen in pterosaurs and living <a href="pelicans">pelicans</a>, and would likewise have allowed spinosaurids to swallow large prey such as fish and other animals. They also reported that the possible Portuguese "Baryonyx" fossils were found associated with isolated "Iguanodon" teeth, and listed it along with other such associations as support for opportunistic feeding behaviour in spinosaurs. Another 2016 study by the French palaeontologist Romain Vullo and colleagues found that the jaws of spinosaurids were convergent with those of <a href="pike%20conger%20eel">pike conger eel</a>s; these fish also have jaws that are compressed side to side (whereas the jaws of crocodilians are compressed from top to bottom), an elongated snout with a "terminal rosette" that bears enlarged teeth, and a notch behind the rosette with smaller teeth. Such jaws likely evolved for grabbing prey in aquatic environments with low light, and may have helped in prey detection.

In their original description, Charig and Milner did not consider "Baryonyx" to be aquatic (due to its nostrils being on the sides of its snout—far from the tip—and the form of the post-cranial skeleton), but thought it was capable of swimming, like most land vertebrates. They speculated that the elongated skull, long neck, and strong humerus of "Baryonyx" indicated that the animal was a facultative <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>, unique among theropods. In their 1997 article they found no skeletal support for this, but maintained that the forelimbs would have been strong enough for a quadrupedal posture and it would probably have caught aquatic prey while crouching—or on all fours—near (or in) water. A 2014 re-description of "Spinosaurus" by the German palaeontologist Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues based on new remains suggested that it was a quadruped, based on its anterior <a href="centre%20of%20body%20mass">centre of body mass</a>. The authors found quadrupedality unlikely for "Baryonyx", since the better-known legs of the closely related "Suchomimus" did not support this posture. Various theories have been proposed for the tall neural spines (or "sails") of spinosaurids, such as use in <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>, fat-storage in a hump, or <a href="Biological%20ornament">display</a>, and in 2015, the German biophysicist Jan Gimsa and colleagues suggested that this feature could also have aided aquatic movement by improving manoeuvrability when submerged, and acted as fulcrum for powerful movements of the neck and tail (similar to those of <a href="sailfish">sailfish</a> or <a href="thresher%20sharks">thresher sharks</a>).

In 2017, the British palaeontologist David E. Hone and Holtz pointed out that (like other theropods) there was no reason to believe that the forelimbs of "Baryonyx" were able to <a href="pronate">pronate</a> (crossing the radius and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand), and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for locomotion may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations. A 2018 study of <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a> (through simulation with 3D models) by the Canadian palaeontologist Donald M. Henderson found that distantly related theropods floated as well as the tested spinosaurs, and instead supported they would have stayed by the shorelines or shallow water rather than being semi-aquatic.
A 2010 study by the French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a>, based on the <a href="oxygen%20isotope">oxygen isotope</a> composition of spinosaurid teeth from around the world compared with that of other theropods and extant animals. Spinosaurids probably spent much of the day in water, like crocodiles and <a href="hippopotamuses">hippopotamuses</a>, and had a diet similar to the former; both were opportunistic predators. Since most spinosaurids do not appear to have anatomical adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, the authors proposed that submersion in water was a means of thermoregulation similar to that of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Spinosaurids may also have turned to aquatic habitats and piscivory to <a href="Niche%20partitioning">avoid competition</a> with large, more-terrestrial theropods. In 2016, Sales and colleagues statistically examined the fossil distribution of spinosaurids, <a href="abelisaurids">abelisaurids</a>, and <a href="carcharodontosaurids">carcharodontosaurids</a>, and concluded that spinosaurids had the strongest support for association with coastal palaeoenvironments. Spinosaurids also appear to have inhabited inland environments (with their distribution there being comparable to carcharodontosaurids), which indicates they may have been more generalist than usually thought.

Sales and Schultz agreed in 2017 that spinosaurids were semiaquatic and partially piscivorous, based on skull features such as conical teeth, snouts that were compressed from side to side, and retracted nostrils. They interpreted the fact that <a href="histological">histological</a> data indicates some spinosaurids were more terrestrial than others as reflecting ecological niche partitioning among them. As some spinosaurids have smaller nostrils than others, their <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> abilities were presumably lesser, as in modern piscivorous animals, and they may instead have used other senses (such as vision and <a href="mechanoreception">mechanoreception</a>) when hunting fish. Olfaction may have been more useful for spinosaurids that also fed on terrestrial prey, such as baryonychines. A 2018 study by the French palaeontologist Auguste Hassler and colleagues of <a href="calcium%20isotopes">calcium isotopes</a> in the teeth of North African theropods found that spinosaurids had a mixed diet of fish and herbivorous dinosaurs, whereas the other theropods examined (abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids) mainly fed on herbivorous dinosaurs. This indicates <a href="ecological%20partitioning">ecological partitioning</a> between these theropods, and that spinosaurids were semi-aquatic predators.

A 2017 histological study of <a href="growth%20lines">growth lines</a> by the German palaeontologist Katja Waskow and Mateus found that the possible Portuguese "Baryonyx" specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, and the presence of both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to <a href="paedomorphosis">paedomorphosis</a> (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as <a href="plesiosaurs">plesiosaurs</a> and <a href="temnospondyls">temnospondyls</a>). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point. In 2018, the Brazilian palaeontologist Tito Aureliano and colleagues reported a spinosaurid tibia from Brazil which exhibited high compactness of the bone, a feature which is correlated with semi-aquatic habits in tetrapods; it is used for ballast to reduce buoyancy caused by the air-filled lungs. Mammal groups with such bone compactness are adapted for living in shallow water.

The Weald Clay Formation consists of sediments of <a href="Hauterivian">Hauterivian</a> (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) age, about 130–125 million years old. The "B. walkeri" holotype was found in the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> or <a href="mudflat">mudflat</a> environment with shallow water, <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, and <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es. During the Early Cretaceous, the <a href="Weald">Weald</a> area of Surrey, Sussex, and <a href="Kent">Kent</a> was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-<a href="brackish%20water">brackish water</a> <a href="Wealden%20Lake">Wealden Lake</a>. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a <a href="river%20delta">river delta</a>; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was <a href="sub-tropical">sub-tropical</a>, similar to the present <a href="Mediterranean%20region">Mediterranean region</a>. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different <a href="stratigraphic%20levels">stratigraphic levels</a>, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the <a href="ornithopods">ornithopods</a> "<a href="Mantellisaurus">Mantellisaurus</a>", "Iguanodon", and small <a href="sauropods">sauropods</a>. Other vertebrates from the Weald Clay include crocodiles, pterosaurs, lizards (such as "<a href="Dorsetisaurus">Dorsetisaurus</a>"), amphibians, sharks (such as "<a href="Hybodus">Hybodus</a>"), and bony fishes (including "Scheenstia"). Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including "<a href="Valditermes">Valditermes</a>", "<a href="Archisphex">Archisphex</a>", and "<a href="Pterinoblattina">Pterinoblattina</a>". Other invertebrates include <a href="ostracods">ostracods</a>, <a href="isopods">isopods</a>, <a href="conchostracans">conchostracans</a>, and <a href="bivalves">bivalves</a>. The plants "<a href="Weichselia">Weichselia</a>" and the aquatic, <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> "<a href="Bevhalstia">Bevhalstia</a>" were common. Other plants found include <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="horsetails">horsetails</a>, <a href="club%20mosses">club mosses</a>, and <a href="conifers">conifers</a>.

Other dinosaurs from the <a href="Wessex%20Formation">Wessex Formation</a> of the Isle of Wight include the theropods "<a href="Neovenator">Neovenator</a>", "<a href="Aristosuchus">Aristosuchus</a>", "<a href="Thecocoelurus">Thecocoelurus</a>", "<a href="Calamospondylus">Calamospondylus</a>", and "<a href="Ornithodesmus">Ornithodesmus</a>"; the ornithopods "Iguanodon", "<a href="Hypsilophodon">Hypsilophodon</a>", and "<a href="Valdosaurus">Valdosaurus</a>"; the sauropods "<a href="Ornithopsis">Ornithopsis</a>", "<a href="Eucamerotus">Eucamerotus</a>", and "<a href="Chondrosteosaurus">Chondrosteosaurus</a>"; and the <a href="ankylosaur">ankylosaur</a> "<a href="Polacanthus">Polacanthus</a>". The Papo Seco Formation of Portugal where "Baryonyx" has possibly been identified is composed of <a href="marl">marl</a>, representing a lagoon environment. Other dinosaur remains from the area include fragments tentatively assigned to "Mantellisaurus", a <a href="macronaria">macronaria</a>n sauropod, and "Megalosaurus".

Charig and Milner presented a possible scenario explaining the <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (changes during decay and fossilisation) of the "B. walkeri" holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, and the fact that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of deposition, and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment).

The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. Most of the tail appears to have been lost before fossilisation, perhaps due to scavenging, or having rotted and floated off. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back (perhaps tilted slightly to the left, with the right side upwards), which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.

Most of the bones of Portuguese specimen ML1190 were damaged, and some scratches may be marks from small scavengers. The specimen's disarticulation indicates it was transported from a more-terrestrial environment (since many bones are missing), but those found were close together.

Isaac Shelby

Isaac Shelby (December 11, 1750 – July 18, 1826) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">first and fifth Governor of Kentucky</a> and served in the state legislatures of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. He was also a soldier in <a href="Lord%20Dunmore%27s%20War">Lord Dunmore's War</a>, the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, and the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. While governor, he led the <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> militia in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>, an action that was rewarded with a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>. Counties in nine states, and several cities and military bases, have been named in his honor. His fondness for <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28delegate%29">John Dickinson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Liberty%20Song">The Liberty Song</a>" is believed to be the reason Kentucky adopted the state motto "<a href="United%20we%20stand%2C%20divided%20we%20fall">United we stand, divided we fall</a>".

Issac Shelby's military service began when he served as second-in-command to his father at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Point%20Pleasant">Battle of Point Pleasant</a>, the only major battle of <a href="Lord%20Dunmore%27s%20War">Lord Dunmore's War</a>. He gained the reputation of an expert woodsman and surveyor and spent the early part of the Revolutionary War gathering supplies for the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>. Later in the war, he and <a href="John%20Sevier">John Sevier</a> led expeditions over the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> against the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> forces in North Carolina. He played a pivotal role in the British defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kings%20Mountain">Battle of Kings Mountain</a>. For his service, Shelby was presented with a ceremonial sword and a pair of pistols by the <a href="North%20Carolina%20legislature">North Carolina legislature</a>, and the nickname "Old Kings Mountain" followed him the rest of his life.

Following the war, Isaac Shelby relocated to Kentucky on <a href="Land%20grant">lands awarded to him</a> for his military service and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> of Virginia to a separate <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a>. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens, and the <a href="Kentucky%20electoral%20college">Kentucky electoral college</a> unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky from <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> attacks and organized its first government. He used the <a href="Citizen%20Genet">Citizen Genet</a> affair to convince the <a href="George%20Washington">Washington</a> administration to make an agreement with the <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> for free trade on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>.

At the end of his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby retired from public life, but he was called back into politics by the impending <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily and, at the request of General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, commanded troops from Kentucky at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>. After the war, he declined President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>'s offer to become <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>. In his last act of public service, Shelby and <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> acted as commissioners to negotiate the <a href="Jackson%20Purchase%20%28U.S.%20historical%20region%29">Jackson Purchase</a> from the <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a> Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died at his estate in <a href="Lincoln%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lincoln County, Kentucky</a> on July 18, 1826.

Isaac Shelby was born in the <a href="Colony%20of%20Maryland">Colony of Maryland</a> on December 11, 1750, near <a href="Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland">Hagerstown</a> in <a href="Frederick%20County%2C%20Maryland">Frederick</a> (now <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Maryland">Washington</a>) County. He was the third child and second son of <a href="Evan%20Shelby">Evan and Letitia (Cox) Shelby</a>, who immigrated from <a href="Tregaron">Tregaron</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, in 1735. Though the family had been loyal to the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, they became <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterians</a> after coming to <a href="British%20America">British America</a>; this was the denomination Isaac Shelby embraced during his life.

Shelby was educated at the local schools in his native colony. He worked on his father's plantation and occasionally found work as a surveyor. At age eighteen he was appointed <a href="deputy%20sheriff">deputy sheriff</a> of Frederick County. Shelby's father lost a great deal of money when <a href="Pontiac%27s%20Rebellion">Pontiac's Rebellion</a> disrupted his lucrative fur trade business, and two years later, the business' records were destroyed in a house fire. Consequently, in December 1770 the family moved to the area near <a href="Bristol%2C%20Tennessee">Bristol, Tennessee</a>, where they built a fort and a <a href="trading%20post">trading post</a>. Here, Shelby and his father worked for three years herding cattle.

During Lord Dunmore's War, a border conflict between colonists and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a>, Isaac Shelby was commissioned as a lieutenant in the <a href="Virginia%20militia">Virginia militia</a> by Colonel William Preston. As second-in-command of his father's <a href="Fincastle%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fincastle County</a> company, he took part in the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Point%20Pleasant">Battle of Point Pleasant</a> on October 10, 1774. The younger Shelby earned commendation for his skill and gallantry in this battle. The victorious militiamen erected <a href="Fort%20Randolph%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Fort Blair</a> on the site of the battle. They remained stationed there, with Shelby as second-in-command, until July 1775 when <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">Lord Dunmore</a> ordered the fort destroyed, fearing it might become useful to colonial rebels in the growing <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>.

After his unit was disbanded, Shelby surveyed for the <a href="Transylvania%20Company">Transylvania Company</a>, a land company that purchased much of present-day Kentucky from the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>s in a deal later invalidated by the government of Virginia. After fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land for himself. After falling ill, he returned home in July 1776 to recover. Back in Virginia, fighting in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> was underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety appointing him captain of a company of <a href="Minutemen">Minutemen</a>. In 1777, Virginia governor <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a> appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army on the frontier. He served a similar role for units in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> in 1778 and 1779. With his money, Shelby purchased provisions for John Sevier's 1779 expedition against the <a href="Chickamauga%20%28tribe%29">Chickamauga</a>, a band of Cherokees who were resisting colonial expansion.

Shelby was elected to represent <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Washington County</a> in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> in 1779. Later that year, he was commissioned a major by Governor <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and charged with escorting a group of commissioners to establish a frontier boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina. Shortly after his arrival in the region, <a href="Governor%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina Governor</a> <a href="Richard%20Caswell">Richard Caswell</a> made him <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a> of newly formed <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Sullivan County</a> and elevated him to the rank of colonel of the <a href="Sullivan%20County%20Regiment">Sullivan County Regiment</a>..

Shelby was surveying lands in Kentucky in 1780 when he heard of the colonists' defeat at <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">Charleston</a>. He hurried to North Carolina, where he found a request for aid from General <a href="Charles%20McDowell%20%28North%20Carolina%20politician%29">Charles McDowell</a> to defend the borders of North Carolina from the British. Shelby assembled three hundred militiamen and joined McDowell at Cherokee Ford in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. On the morning of July 31, 1780, he surrounded the British stronghold at Thickety Fort on the <a href="Pacolet%20River">Pacolet River</a> with 600 men. He immediately demanded a surrender, but the British refused. Shelby brought his men within <a href="musket">musket</a> range and again demanded surrender. Though the fort likely would have withstood the attack, the British commander lost his nerve and capitulated. Without firing a shot, Shelby's men captured 94 prisoners. 

Following the surrender of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of <a href="Partisan%20%28military%29">partisan</a>s under Lieutenant <a href="Elijah%20Clarke">Elijah Clarke</a>. This unit was pursued by British Major <a href="Patrick%20Ferguson">Patrick Ferguson</a>. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cedar%20Springs">Battle of Cedar Springs</a>.

General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the <a href="Enoree%20River">Enoree River</a>. They rode all night with two hundred men, reaching their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a <a href="Breastwork%20%28fortification%29">breastwork</a> from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued them back to the main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.

Shelby and Clarke elected not to pursue the British fleeing the <a href="Battle%20of%20Musgrove%20Mill">Battle of Musgrove Mill</a>. Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at <a href="Ninety%20Six%2C%20South%20Carolina">Ninety Six, South Carolina</a>, where they were sure they would find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>' defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Battle of Camden</a>. With the backing of General <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Cornwallis</a>, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.
Following the colonists' retreat, an emboldened Ferguson dispatched a paroled prisoner across the mountains to warn the colonists to cease their opposition or Ferguson would lay waste to the countryside. Angered by this act, Shelby and <a href="John%20Sevier">John Sevier</a> began to plan another raid on the British. Shelby and Sevier raised 240 men each, and were joined by <a href="William%20Campbell%20%28general%29">William Campbell</a> with 400 from Washington County, Virginia and Charles McDowell with 160 men from <a href="Burke%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Burke</a> and <a href="Rutherford%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Rutherford</a> counties in North Carolina. The forces mustered at <a href="Sycamore%20Shoals">Sycamore Shoals</a> on September 25, 1780. The troops crossed the difficult terrain of the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> and arrived at McDowell's estate near <a href="Morganton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Morganton, North Carolina</a>, on September 30, 1780. Here, they were joined by Colonel <a href="Benjamin%20Cleveland">Benjamin Cleveland</a> and Major <a href="Joseph%20Winston">Joseph Winston</a> with 350 men from <a href="Surry%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Surry</a> and <a href="Wilkes%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilkes</a> counties.

The combined force pursued Ferguson to <a href="Kings%20Mountain%2C%20North%20Carolina">Kings Mountain</a>, where he had fortified himself, declaring "God Almighty and all the rebels out of hell" could not move him from it. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Kings%20Mountain">Battle of Kings Mountain</a> commenced October 7, 1780. Shelby had ordered his men to advance from tree to tree, firing from behind each one; he called this technique "Indian play" because he had seen the Indians use it in battles with them. Ferguson ordered <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> charges that forced Shelby's men to fall back on three separate occasions, but the colonists dislodged Ferguson's men from their position. Seeing the battle was lost, Ferguson and his key officers attempted a retreat. The colonists were instructed to kill Ferguson. Simultaneous shots by Sevier's men broke both Ferguson's arms, fatally pierced his skull, and knocked him from his mount. Seeing their commander dead, the remaining British soldiers waved <a href="White%20flag%23Flag%20of%20temporary%20truce%20in%20order%20to%20parl%C3%A9%20%28negotiate%29">white flags</a> of surrender.

Kings Mountain was the high point of Shelby's military service, and from that point forward his men dubbed him "Old Kings Mountain". The North Carolina legislature passed a vote of thanks to Shelby and Sevier for their service and ordered each be presented a pair of pistols and a ceremonial sword. (Shelby did not receive these items until he requested them from the legislature in 1813.)

As the colonists and their prisoners began the march from Kings Mountain, they learned that nine colonial prisoners had been hanged by the British at Fort Ninety-Six. This was not the first such incident in the region, and the enraged colonists vowed they would now put a stop to the hangings in the Carolinas. Summoning a jury from their number – which was legal because two North Carolina magistrates were present – the colonists selected random prisoners and charged them with crimes ranging from theft to arson to murder. By evening, the jury had convicted thirty-six prisoners and sentenced them to hang. After the first nine hangings, however, Shelby ordered them stopped. He never gave a reason for this action, but his order was obeyed nonetheless, and the remaining "convicts" rejoined their fellow prisoners.

The Kings Mountain victors and their prisoners returned to McDowell's estate, early on, the morning of, October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders and their men went their separate ways. Shelby and his men joined General <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised Morgan to take <a href="Siege%20of%20Ninety-Six">Fort Ninety-Six</a> and Augusta, because he believed the British forces there were supplying the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> with weapons for their raids against colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, the supreme commander of colonial forces in the region. Assured that his plan would be carried out, Shelby returned home and promised to return the following spring with 300 men. On his way to Fort Ninety-Six, Morgan was attacked by <a href="Banastre%20Tarleton">Banastre Tarleton</a> and gained a decisive victory over him at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cowpens">Battle of Cowpens</a>. Shelby later lamented the fact, that General <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>, who relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion's share of the credit for Cowpens, when it was Shelby's plan that had put Morgan in the position to begin with.

Upon his return home, Shelby and his father were named commissioners to negotiate a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga. This service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina. Greene had thought to use Shelby's and Sevier's men to prevent Cornwallis from returning to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>. However, Cornwallis was defeated at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Siege of Yorktown</a>, shortly after Shelby and Sevier arrived, and Greene sent them on to join General <a href="Francis%20Marion">Francis Marion</a> on the <a href="Pee%20Dee%20River">Pee Dee River</a>. On Marion's orders, Shelby and Colonel Hezekiah Maham captured a British fort at Fair Lawn near <a href="Moncks%20Corner%2C%20South%20Carolina">Moncks Corner</a> on November 27, 1781.

While still in the field, Shelby was elected to the <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a>. He requested and was granted a leave of absence from the Army to attend the legislative session of December 1781. He was re-elected in 1782 and attended the April session of the legislature that year. In early 1783, he was chosen as a commissioner to survey preemption claims of soldiers along the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland River</a>.

Shelby returned to Kentucky in April 1783, settling at <a href="Boonesborough%2C%20Kentucky">Boonesborough</a>. He married Susannah Hart on April 19, 1783; the couple had eleven children. Their eldest daughter, Sarah, married Dr. <a href="Ephraim%20McDowell">Ephraim McDowell</a>, and the youngest daughter, Letitia, married future Kentucky secretary of state <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20Todd">Charles Stewart Todd</a>. On November 1, 1783, the family moved to <a href="Lincoln%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lincoln County</a>, near Knob Lick, and occupied land awarded to Shelby for his military service. Shelby was named one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>) in 1783, and on December 1, 1787, founded the <a href="Kentucky%20Society%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20Useful%20Knowledge">Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge</a>.

Shelby began working to secure Kentucky's separation from Virginia as early as 1784. That year, he attended a convention to consider leading an expedition against the Indians and separating Kentucky from Virginia. He was a delegate to subsequent conventions in 1787, 1788, and 1789 that worked toward a constitution for Kentucky. During these conventions he helped thwart <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>'s scheme to align Kentucky with the Spanish. In 1791 Shelby, <a href="Charles%20Scott%20%28governor%20of%20Kentucky%29">Charles Scott</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Logan">Benjamin Logan</a> were among those chosen by the Virginia legislature to serve on the Board of War for the district of Kentucky. Shelby was also made <a href="High%20Sheriff">High Sheriff</a> on Lincoln County. In 1792, he was a delegate to the final convention that framed the first <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a>.

Under the new constitution, the voters chose <a href="electoral%20college">electors</a> who then elected the governor and members of the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>. Though there is no indication that Shelby actively sought the office of governor, he was elected unanimously to that post by the electors on May 17, 1791. He took office on June 4, 1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union. Though not actively partisan, he identified with the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic-Republicans</a>. Much of his term was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax structure.

One of Shelby's chief concerns was securing federal aid to defend the frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">an undeclared war</a> with American Indians north of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a>, Shelby had been ordered by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20Knox">Henry Knox</a> not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.

Shelby appealed to President Washington for help; Washington responded by appointing General "Mad" <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> to the area with orders to push the Indians out of the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a>. Wayne arrived at Fort Washington (present-day <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>) in May 1793, but was prevented from taking any immediate action because federal commissioners were still attempting to negotiate a treaty with the Indians. He called for 1,000 volunteer troops from Kentucky, but few heeded the call and Shelby resorted to <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. By the time the soldiers arrived, winter had set in. He ordered the men to go home and return in the spring.

After a winter filled with Indian attacks, including one which claimed the life of Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at <a href="Greenville%2C%20Ohio">Fort Greenville</a> and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 <a href="Battle%20of%20Fallen%20Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>. This victory, and the ensuing <a href="Treaty%20of%20Greenville">Treaty of Greenville</a>, secured the territory, and although Shelby did not agree with some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.

Another major concern of the Shelby administration was free navigation on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a> to the Americans. This would have been the natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.

While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, they had a strong affinity for the French. They admired the <a href="Republicanism">republican</a> government that had arisen from the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador <a href="Edmond-Charles%20Gen%C3%AAt">Edmond-Charles Genêt</a>, popularly known as Citizen Genêt, arrived in the United States in April 1793, <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a> was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west. Genêt's agent, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Michaux">André Michaux</a>, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition. When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and Kentucky Senator <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Kentucky%29">John Brown</a>.
Jefferson had written a separate letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, but there is no evidence that Shelby agreed to help him. In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians "possess too just a sense of the obligation they owe the General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States".

In November 1793, Shelby received a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. <a href="Arthur%20St.%20Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a>, governor of the American <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a>, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.

In his response to Jefferson, Shelby questioned whether he had the legal authority to intervene with force against his constituency and expressed his personal aversion to doing so.

Shelby tempered this lukewarm commitment by assuring Jefferson that "I shall, at all times, hold it my duty to perform whatever may be constitutionally required of me, as Governor of Kentucky, by the President of the United States."

In March 1794, perhaps in response to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers in the event of an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor <a href="Edmund%20Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a>, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.

Having successfully dealt with the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, at the conclusion of his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">presidential elector</a> in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.

<a href="Gabriel%20Slaughter">Gabriel Slaughter</a> was the favorite choice for governor of Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured him that he had no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.

The situation with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Cries grew louder for Shelby to return as Kentucky's chief executive. On July 18, 1812, less than a month before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced his candidacy.

During the campaign Shelby's political enemies, notably <a href="Humphrey%20Marshall%20%28Senator%29">Humphrey Marshall</a>, criticized his response to Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention to the situation in the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.

Slaughter's supporters mocked Shelby's advanced age (he was almost 62), calling him "Old Daddy Shelby". One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous charge that Shelby had run from the Battle of Kings Mountain. Though few even among Shelby's enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself responded through missives in the state's newspapers. One supporter typified these responses, writing "It is reported that Colonel Shelby 'run [sic] at Kings Mountain.' True he did. He first run [sic] up to the enemy ... then after an action of about forty-seven minutes, he run [sic] again with 900 prisoners."

As the canvass stretched into August, Shelby grew more confident of victory and began preparations to return to the state house. He predicted a victory of 10,000 votes; the final margin was more than 17,000. When he took the oath of office, Shelby became the first Kentucky governor to serve non-consecutive terms. (<a href="James%20Garrard">James Garrard</a> had been permitted to serve consecutive terms in 1796 and 1800 by special legislative exemption.)
Preparations for the war dominated Shelby's second term. Two days before his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport</a> before hurrying to the defense of <a href="Fort%20Wayne">Fort Wayne</a>.

Shelby pressured President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to give Harrison command of all military forces in the Northwest. Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier appointment of <a href="James%20Winchester">James Winchester</a>. On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male between the ages of 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers were excluded from the provision. Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away. Shelby encouraged the state's women to sew and knit items for Kentucky's troops.

Shelby's confidence in the federal government's war planning was shaken by the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Frenchtown">Battle of Frenchtown</a> in which a number of Kentucky soldiers died. He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so. In March 1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at <a href="Fort%20Meigs">Fort Meigs</a>. Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest son James, under General <a href="Green%20Clay">Green Clay</a>. The reinforcements arrived to find Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians. Clay's force was able to stop the siege, but a large number of them were captured and massacred by Indians. Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner exchange.

On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby requesting volunteers, and this time he asked that Shelby lead them personally. Shelby raised a force of 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested. Future governor <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> served as Shelby's <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>. Now a <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a>, Shelby led the volunteers to join Harrison in a campaign that culminated in the American victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>.

In Harrison's report of the battle to Secretary of War <a href="John%20Armstrong%2C%20Jr.">John Armstrong, Jr.</a>, he said of Shelby, "I am at a loss to how to mention [the service] of Governor Shelby, being convinced that no eulogism of mine can reach his merit." In 1817, Shelby received the <a href="thanks%20of%20Congress">thanks of Congress</a> and was awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> for his service in the war. Friends of Shelby suggested he run for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a>, but Shelby quickly and emphatically declined.

Upon Shelby's leaving office in 1816, President Monroe offered him the post of Secretary of War, but he declined because of his age. Already a founding member of the <a href="Kentucky%20Bible%20Society">Kentucky Bible Society</a>, Shelby consented to serve as vice-president of the <a href="New%20American%20Bible%20Society">New American Bible Society</a> in 1816. He was a faithful member of <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville</a> Presbyterian church, but in 1816, built a small nondenominational church on his property. In 1818, he accompanied Andrew Jackson in negotiating the Jackson Purchase with the Chickasaw. He also served as the first president of the <a href="Kentucky%20Agricultural%20Society">Kentucky Agricultural Society</a> in 1818 and was chairman of the first board of trustees of <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in 1819.

In 1820, Isaac Shelby was stricken with <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> in his right arm and leg. He died of a stroke on July 18, 1826, at his home in Lincoln County. He was buried on the grounds of his estate, Traveller's Rest. The state erected a monument over his grave in 1827. In 1952 the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the <a href="Isaac%20Shelby%20Cemetery%20State%20Historic%20Site">Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site</a>.

Shelby's patriotism is believed to have inspired the Kentucky state motto: "<a href="United%20we%20stand%2C%20divided%20we%20fall">United we stand, divided we fall</a>". He was fond of "<a href="The%20Liberty%20Song">The Liberty Song</a>", a 1768 composition by <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28delegate%29">John Dickinson</a>, which contains the line "They join in hand, brave Americans all, By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall." Though he is sometimes credited with designing the <a href="Seal%20of%20Kentucky">state seal</a>, his public papers show that the design was suggested by <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>.

Centre College began awarding the Isaac Shelby Medallion in 1972, and since then, it has become the college's most prestigious honor. Those awarded the Medallion exemplify the ideals of service to Centre and dedication to the public good that were embraced by Shelby during his time at Centre and in Kentucky.

Nine states have a county named after Shelby, as do numerous cities and military installations.

HMS "Indefatigable" was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Indefatigable-class%20battlecruiser">her class</a> of three <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the first decade of the 20th Century. When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began, "Indefatigable" was serving with the <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (BCS) in the Mediterranean, where she unsuccessfully pursued the battlecruiser and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> of the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Navy">German Imperial Navy</a> as they fled towards the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The ship bombarded Ottoman fortifications defending the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> on 3 November 1914, then, following a refit in Malta, returned to the United Kingdom in February where she rejoined the 2nd BCS.

"Indefatigable" was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, the largest naval battle of the war. Part of <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Sir David Beatty</a>'s Battlecruiser Fleet, she was hit several times in the first minutes of the "Run to the South", the opening phase of the battlecruiser action. Shells from the German battlecruiser caused an explosion ripping a hole in her hull, and a second explosion hurled large pieces of the ship 200 feet (60 m) in the air. Only three of the crew of 1,019 survived.

No battlecruisers were ordered after the three ships in 1905 until "Indefatigable" became the lone battlecruiser of the 1908–1909 Naval Programme. A new <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Government</a> had taken power in January 1906 and demanded reductions in naval spending, and the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> submitted a reduced programme, requesting <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s but no battlecruisers. The <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> rejected this proposal in favour of two outmoded <a href="armoured%20cruisers">armoured cruisers</a> but finally acceded to a request for one battlecruiser instead, after the Admiralty pointed out the need to match the recently published German naval construction plan and to maintain the heavy gun and armour industries. "Indefatigable"s outline design was prepared in March 1908, and the final design, slightly larger than "Invincible" with a revised protection arrangement and additional length <a href="Axial%20fire">amidships</a> to allow her two middle <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a> to fire on either <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, was approved in November 1908. A larger design with more armour and better underwater protection was rejected as too expensive.

"Indefatigable" had an overall length of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. The ship normally displaced and at deep load. She had a crew of 737 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.

The ship was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 10 April 1911, "Indefatigable" reached a top speed of from after her propellers were replaced. She carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

The "Indefatigable" class had a <a href="main%20battery">main armament</a> of eight <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech-loading</a> <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20X%20naval%20gun">BL 12-inch Mark X guns</a> mounted in four hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms">port</a> of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms">starboard</a> and <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms">aft</a>. 'P' and 'Q' turrets had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Their <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of sixteen <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch Mark VII guns</a> positioned in the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. They mounted two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each side aft of 'X' <a href="barbette">barbette</a>, and twelve torpedoes were carried.

The "Indefatigable"s were protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armoured%20belt">armoured belt</a> that extended between and covered the end <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. Their armoured <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

"Indefatigable" was unique among British battlecruisers in having an armoured spotting and signal tower behind the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, protected by of armour. However, the spotting tower was of limited use, as its view was obscured by the conning tower in front of it and the legs of the foremast and superstructure behind it. During a pre-war refit, a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was added to the rear of the 'A' turret roof, and this turret was equipped to control the entire main armament as an emergency backup for the normal fire-control positions.

"Indefatigable" received a single <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch 20 cwt</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> gun on a high-angle Mark II mount in March 1915. It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch guns were enclosed in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and given <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft guns were removed at the same time.

She received a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot the fall of the shells.

"Indefatigable" was laid down at the <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Dockyard</a>, <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 23 February 1909. She was launched on 28 October 1909 and was completed on 24 February 1911. Upon commissioning, "Indefatigable" served in the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which in January 1913 was renamed the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (BCS). In December 1913, she transferred to the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, where she joined the <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadron</a>.

"Indefatigable", accompanied by the battlecruiser and under the command of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Archibald%20Berkeley%20Milne">Sir Berkeley Milne</a>, encountered the German battlecruiser "Goeben" and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> "Breslau" on the morning of 4 August 1914, which were headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of <a href="Philippeville%2C%20Algeria">Philippeville</a>. Britain and Germany were not yet at war, so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to <a href="Messina">Messina</a> to re-coal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but "Goeben" and "Breslau" were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time Germany had invaded <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and war had been declared, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay more than six miles (10 km) from the Italian coast precluded entering the <a href="Strait%20of%20Messina">Strait of Messina</a>, from which they could have observed the port directly. Therefore, Milne stationed and "Indefatigable" at the northern exit of the strait, expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports. He stationed the light cruiser at the southern exit, and sent "Indomitable" to coal at <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a>, where she was ready for action in the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, trailed by "Gloucester". Milne, still expecting <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Souchon">Wilhelm Souchon</a> to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at <a href="Malta">Malta</a> until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail at a leisurely for <a href="Cape%20Matapan">Cape Matapan</a>, where "Goeben" had been spotted eight hours earlier. At 2:30 p.m. he received an incorrect message from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. War would not actually be declared until 12 August, and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne gave up the hunt for "Goeben", following his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian break-out attempt. On 9 August Milne was given clear orders to "chase "Goeben" which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east." Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, unaware that the "Goeben" did not intend to come out.

On 3 November 1914, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, then <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the commencement of hostilities between Ottoman Turkey and <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>. The attack was carried out by "Indomitable" and "Indefatigable", as well as the French <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s and . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at <a href="Sedd%20el%20Bahr">Sedd el Bahr</a> at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before Britain's formal declaration of war on 6 November against the Ottoman Empire. "Indefatigable" remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by "Inflexible" on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta for a refit; she then sailed to England on 14 February and joined the 2nd BCS upon her arrival. The ship conducted uneventful patrols of the North Sea for the next year and a half. She was the temporary flagship of the 2nd BCS during April–May 1916, while her <a href="sister%20ship">half-sister</a> was under repair after colliding with "Indefatigable"s other half-sister .

On 31 May 1916, the 2nd BCS consisted of "New Zealand" (<a href="flagship">flagship</a> of Rear-Admiral <a href="William%20Christopher%20Pakenham">William Pakenham</a>) and "Indefatigable". The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms">astern</a> of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and to reduce speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was <a href="Echelon%20formation">echeloned</a> to the right with "Indefatigable" in the rear and furthest to the west, and "New Zealand" ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. "Indefatigable" aimed at and "New Zealand" targeted while remaining unengaged herself. By 3:54, the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">points</a> to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.

Around 4:00, "Indefatigable" was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from "Von der Tann". She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">listing</a> to port. Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits, one on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part of the ship and large pieces were thrown into the air. The most likely cause of her loss was a <a href="deflagration">deflagration</a> or low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the steering control shafts, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. "Von der Tann" fired only fifty-two shells at "Indefatigable" before she exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors found "Indefatigable's" captain, C. F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued. Two survivors, <a href="Able%20Seaman">Able Seaman</a> Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, were rescued by the German <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> . A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was picked up by another unknown German ship. He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from <a href="HMS%20Nestor%20%281915%29">HMS "Nestor"</a> in "The Times" on 24 June 1916.

"Indefatigable", along with the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly declared a protected place under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a>, to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,016 men. <a href="Mount%20Indefatigable">Mount Indefatigable</a> in the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a> was named after the battlecruiser in 1917. The wreck was identified by nautical archaeologist <a href="Innes%20McCartney">Innes McCartney</a> in 2001, when it was found to have been heavily salvaged sometime in the past.

Ursula Franklin

Ursula Martius Franklin, (16 September 1921 – 22 July 2016), was a German-Canadian <a href="metallurgy">metallurgist</a>, research <a href="physics">physicist</a>, author, and educator who taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> for more than 40 years. She was the author of "The Real World of Technology", which is based on her 1989 <a href="Massey%20Lectures">Massey Lectures</a>; "The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map", a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and "Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts", containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>. Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the <a href="Governor%20General%27s%20Awards%20in%20Commemoration%20of%20the%20Persons%20Case">Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case</a> for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the <a href="Pearson%20Medal%20of%20Peace">Pearson Medal of Peace</a> for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame</a>. A Toronto high school, <a href="Ursula%20Franklin%20Academy">Ursula Franklin Academy</a>, has been named in her honour.

Franklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive "system" that includes methods, procedures, organization, "and most of all, a mindset". She distinguished between "holistic" technologies used by craft workers or artisans and "prescriptive" ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes "a culture of compliance".

For some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of <a href="Harold%20Innis">Harold Innis</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a> who warn about technology's tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization. Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including <a href="Lewis%20Mumford">Lewis Mumford</a>, <a href="C.%20B.%20Macpherson">C. B. Macpherson</a>, <a href="E.%20F.%20Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a>, and <a href="Vandana%20Shiva">Vandana Shiva</a>. This debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women. In addition to the <a href="Philosophy%20of%20technology">Philosophy of technology</a>, she believed that science was "severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge".

Ursula Maria Martius was born in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> on September 16, 1921. Her mother was Jewish and an <a href="art%20history">art historian</a> and her father, an <a href="ethnography">ethnographer</a>, came from an old German <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> family. Franklin once stated that her father was an "Africanist." Because of the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> persecution of the Jews, her parents tried to send their only child to school in <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> when <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Berlin University</a> until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself was sent to a forced labour camp and repaired bombed buildings. The family survived <a href="The%20Holocaust">The Holocaust</a> and was reunited in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> after the war.

Franklin decided to study science because she went to school during a time when the teaching of history was censored. "I remember a real subversive pleasure," she told an interviewer many years later, "that there was no word of authority that could change either the laws of <a href="physics">physics</a> or the conduct of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>." In 1948, Franklin received her <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in experimental physics at the <a href="Technical%20University%20of%20Berlin">Technical University of Berlin</a>. She began to look for opportunities to leave Germany after realizing there was no place there for someone fundamentally opposed to <a href="militarism">militarism</a> and oppression. Franklin moved to Canada after being offered the Lady Davis postdoctoral fellowship at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> in 1949. She then worked for 15 years (from 1952 to 1967) as first a research fellow and then as a senior research scientist at the <a href="Provincial%20Research%20Organization">Ontario Research Foundation</a>. In 1967, Franklin became a researcher and associate professor at the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science University of Toronto's Faculty of Engineering where she was an expert in <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and <a href="Materials%20science%20and%20engineering">materials science</a>. She was promoted to full professor in 1973 and was given the designation of University Professor in 1984, becoming the first female professor to receive the university's highest honour. She was appointed <a href="professor%20emeritus">professor emerita</a> in 1987, a title she retained until her death. She served as director of the university's Museum Studies Program from 1987 to 1989, was named a Fellow of the <a href="Ontario%20Institute%20for%20Studies%20in%20Education">Ontario Institute for Studies in Education</a> in 1988, and a Senior Fellow of <a href="Massey%20College">Massey College</a> in 1989.

Franklin was a pioneer in the field of <a href="Archaeological%20science">archaeometry</a>, which applies modern materials analysis to <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin's use of microscopic, etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects' surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings. Franklin's expertise was also instrumental to dating glass; she guided a study on the remains of blue <a href="Trade%20beads">glass beads in North America</a> remaining from early trade relationships between American Indian tribes and Europe.

In the early 1960s Franklin was one of a number of scientists who participated in the <a href="Baby%20Tooth%20Survey">Baby Tooth Survey</a>, a project founded by Eric and <a href="Louise%20Reiss">Louise Reiss</a> along with other scientists such as <a href="Barry%20Commoner">Barry Commoner</a>, which investigated levels of <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a>—a <a href="Radioactivity">radioactive</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a> in <a href="Nuclear%20fallout">fallout</a> from <a href="Nuclear%20testing">nuclear weapons testing</a>—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of <a href="Nuclear%20testing%23Types%20of%20nuclear%20weapons%20tests">atmospheric weapons testing</a>. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.

As a member of the <a href="Science%20Council%20of%20Canada">Science Council of Canada</a> during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an influential study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, "Canada as a Conserver Society", recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.

Franklin was also active in the Voice of Women (VOW), now the <a href="Canadian%20Voice%20of%20Women%20for%20Peace">Canadian Voice of Women for Peace</a>, one of Canada's leading social advocacy organizations. In 1968, she and VOW national president <a href="Muriel%20Duckworth">Muriel Duckworth</a> presented a brief to a <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a> committee asserting that Canada and the United States had entered into <a href="Defence%20Production%20Sharing%20Agreement">military trade agreements</a> without adequate public debate. They argued that these commercial arrangements made it difficult for Canada to adopt independent foreign policy positions such as calling for an immediate U.S. military withdrawal from <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. In 1969, Franklin and Duckworth called on a committee of the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Canadian Senate</a> to recommend that Canada discontinue its <a href="Chemical%20warfare">chemical</a> and <a href="Biological%20warfare">biological</a> weapons research and spend money instead on environmental research and <a href="preventive%20medicine">preventive medicine</a>. Franklin was also part of a 1969 VOW delegation that urged the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">federal government</a> to withdraw from the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> and establish a special agency to oversee Canadian <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a>.

In the 1980s, Franklin participated in an organized campaign to win the right for <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>s to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the <a href="Section%20Two%20of%20the%20Canadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">freedom of conscience provision</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was to be part of an appeal to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating <a href="Income%20taxes%20in%20Canada">the Income Tax Act</a>. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.

Following Franklin's retirement, she and several other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto claiming it had been <a href="unjust%20enrichment">unjustly enriched</a> by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a <a href="pay%20equity">pay equity</a> settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.

Franklin continued to have a strong association with the University of Toronto's <a href="Massey%20College">Massey College</a> as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident. Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology. Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in "The Ursula Franklin Reader" published in 2006. Franklin is also the author of "The Real World of Technology" which is based on her 1989 <a href="Massey%20Lectures">Massey Lectures</a> broadcast on <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a>.

In a piece of writing entitled "Letter to a Graduate Student," Franklin encouraged the physics career of a student "Marcia," who is devoted to feminism yet interested in physics and unsure of how to integrate the two. In the letter Franklin extolls the merits of colleague <a href="Margaret%20Benston">Maggie Benston</a>, whose contributions to feminist thought and pedagogy, Franklin stated, issued from her integrated way of being and philosophical foundation in science. She cites as an example Benston's point that the negative side affects of contraceptive pills are considered tolerable according to present medical practices that are permeated by the patriarchal bias of reductionism. New methodologies are radically needed, she stressed, in concord with Benston's writings. Franklin's trust in relying on scientific principles to navigate even daily struggles such as an environment "surrounded by jerks" characterizes the letter's cheerful closing, in which she recommends "taking field notes" and imagining oneself as an "explorer come upon a strange tribe." In the letter Franklin mentions as an interested aside the extremely early state of research in solid organic matter, compared to the very well studied condition of solid state physics. She speculates that the neglect of this research area could have a political component, given its benefits to humans rather than to the military.

Ursula Franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," has been at the root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," she writes. "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls "the real world" by "the maps of pacifism and feminism".

For her, feminism meant a completely new point of view: "Feminism isn't an employment agency for women; it's an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember my feeling of joy that one could look at the earth differently. That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes."

Central to Franklin's pacifism and her view of life is what she calls "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual conscience is at the heart of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology "has" changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a "technological imperative" which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution:

Modern weapons technologies, including the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial research and the deployment of weapon systems can be as long as a decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.

Franklin points out that the technological nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.

In her 1987 paper, "Reflections on Theology and Peace", Ursula Franklin contends that "peace is not the absence of war—peace is the absence of fear." She asserts however, that fear of war and violence is not the only kind of fear that destroys peace. She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to what she calls "the threat system" which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.
For her, social justice is the essential element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. "In God's eyes," she writes, "all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally." Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian <a href="Lewis%20Mumford">Lewis Mumford</a>'s observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on to argue that the "moral change that took place under capitalism can be summed up in the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power." Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as <a href="militarism">militarized economies</a> dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. "Any modern theology of peace," she writes, "must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world."

Franklin argues that the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was replaced by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls "another key"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called <a href="globalization">globalization</a> and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. "Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold," Franklin writes, "whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered." A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the <a href="privatization">privatization</a> of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or "marketeers" aim, for example, to transform "the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism." She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by "puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers." Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. "Canada has almost no foreign policy," she says, "but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements."

Franklin recommends that resistance take the form of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as "stakeholders", "users", "health-care providers" and "consumers of education" to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities. Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and "the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces' control of information." Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of "citizen politics", a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems—everything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion. Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in "scrupling", the process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns. She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them "whether those in power like it or not." The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin's words, on "turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world's citizens."

Again and again in her writings, speeches and interviews, Ursula Franklin insists that war and its violence are not only morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast two days after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. "Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years," Franklin said. "The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, is staring us in the face." In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, "It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering."

Franklin suggested that it would have been more effective if, instead of launching a <a href="War%20on%20Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a>, the U.S. had interpreted the attacks as a political earthquake instead of an act of war. She argued that social and political structures are as inherently unstable as geological ones. "Geological fissures and human terrorists are created in a context of forces that can be understood and—at times—mitigated. Neither can be eliminated by bombing."

Franklin asserts that militarism is the ultimate development of hierarchical social structures and threat-based systems. "They all work under the implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others, and that all people are of interest only as long as they are needed to support the system or to justify it." She notes that many prominent advocates for women's rights such as <a href="Jane%20Addams">Jane Addams</a> and <a href="Sylvia%20Pankhurst">Sylvia Pankhurst</a> were pacifists. "To me, the struggle for women's rights and the opposition to militarism in all its forms are two sides of the same coin."

When a CBC Radio interviewer suggested to Franklin that her ideas about peace and justice were not connected with what was actually happening in the aftermath of 9/11, she readily agreed. "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts."

For Ursula Franklin, technology is a set of practices in the "here and now" rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive "system." "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." Her definition is similar to the French thinker <a href="Jacques%20Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a>'s concept of "technique". Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. "Technology has built the house in which we all live," she writes, "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." As such, technology is a central element of the here and now. "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.

According to Ursula Franklin, technology is not a set of neutral tools, methods or practices. She asserts that various categories of technology have markedly different social and political effects. She distinguishes for example, between work-related and control-related technologies. Work-related technologies, such as electric typewriters, are designed to make tasks easier. Computerized word processing makes typing easier still. But when computers are linked into work stations—part of a system—word processing becomes a control-related technology. "Now workers can be timed," Franklin writes, "assignments can be broken up, and the interaction between the operators can be monitored."

Franklin extends the distinction between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of "holistic" and "prescriptive" ones. This enables her to consider the social implications of "how" work is performed. She writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work. "Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish." Artisans may specialize in a particular kind of product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique. Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. "Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, who need to be familiar only with the skills of performing that one step."

Although the <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a>, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process as well as a strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command."

Franklin argues that in modern society, control-related and prescriptive technologies are dominant. "When work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," she writes. "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are "designs for compliance"." For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also come to believe that there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it'."

Franklin points out that prescriptive technologies have moved beyond materials production to the realms of administration, government and social services. She argues that tasks which require nurturing or caring for people, in health and education for example, are best done holistically. Yet such tasks are increasingly coming under the sway of prescriptive technologies based on what Franklin calls a production model. Professor Heather Menzies, an admirer of Franklin, describes for example, how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset, computerized check lists which leave little discretionary time for dealing with the unexpected or talking with patients who are lonely or distressed. Franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet "if there ever was a holistic process, a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps, it is education."

Ursula Franklin rejects the idea that powerful technologies automatically determine the ways in which people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, but are the result of conscious choices. The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion. Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers. "A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating 'domestic' machines," Franklin notes. "In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers." She points to similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.

"Many technological systems, when examined for context and overall design, are basically anti-people," Franklin writes. "People are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions." As a result, people live and work under conditions structured for the well-being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating. "The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home." But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on the way women traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.

Franklin asserts that powerful communications technologies have reshaped political and social realities distancing people from each other and their immediate environments. Radio and television for example, transmit messages instantaneously from afar—messages that are separated from people's experiences in the vicinities where they live and work. Franklin calls such messages "pseudorealities". She writes they are based on images that are constructed, staged and selected to create emotional effects and the illusion of "being there" as a participant, not just as an observer. She asserts however, that one-way communications technologies reduce or eliminate "reciprocity", the normal give and take of face-to-face communication.

According to Franklin, the selective fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced to attract and hold people's attention by focusing on the unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there "and the world is structured to believe in them." She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. "And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'"

"Silence," Franklin writes, "possesses striking similarities [to] aspects of life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments." She argues that the technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes the sound as permanent as the <a href="elevator%20music">Muzak</a> that plays endlessly in public places without anyone's consent. For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the <a href="British%20enclosure%20laws">British enclosure laws</a> which fenced off the <a href="common%20land">commons</a> for private farming.

Franklin maintains that the core of the strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," she told a 1993 conference on <a href="acoustic%20ecology">acoustic ecology</a>, "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered "your" mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence is probably one of the most powerful spiritual forces." Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.

In 1952, Ursula Franklin married Fred Franklin (born 1921), an engineer of German Jewish ancestry who had been exposed to Quakerism while living in <a href="United%20Kingdom">England</a>, where he had been sent to boarding school to escape the Nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to Canada in 1948. They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. "We were pacifists before we were Quakers," Franklin says, "but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children." Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94.

In April 2013, Franklin donated her extensive collection of writings devoted to Chinese culture and history to the Confucius Institute at <a href="Seneca%20College">Seneca College</a> in Toronto. The collection included more than 220 texts, books, publications, and journals interpreting Chinese culture and history from the perspective of Western scholars. It also contained some of Franklin's own working papers and files.

Franklin received numerous awards and honours during her long career. In 1984, she became the first woman at the University of Toronto to be named "University Professor", a special title which is the highest honour given by the university. She was named Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> in 1981 and a Companion of the Order in 1992. She was appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20Ontario">Order of Ontario</a> in 1990. In 1982, she was given the award of merit for the City of Toronto, mainly for her work in neighbourhood planning. She received an honorary membership in the <a href="Delta%20Kappa%20Gamma">Delta Kappa Gamma</a> Society International for women educators in 1985. Two years later, she was given the <a href="Elsie%20MacGill">Elsie Gregory McGill</a> memorial award for her contributions to education, science and technology. In 1989, she received the Wiegand Award which recognizes Canadians who have made significant contributions to the understanding of the human dimensions of science and technology. In 1991, she received a <a href="Governor%20General%27s%20Award">Governor General's Award</a> in Commemoration of the <a href="Edwards%20v.%20Canada%20%28Attorney%20General%29">Person's Case</a> for advancing the equality of girls and women in Canada. The same year, she received the <a href="Sir%20John%20William%20Dawson%20Medal">Sir John William Dawson Medal</a>. She received the 2001 <a href="Pearson%20Medal%20of%20Peace">Pearson Medal of Peace</a> for her work in <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>. She has a <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> <a href="high%20school">high school</a> named after her, <a href="Ursula%20Franklin%20Academy">Ursula Franklin Academy</a>. In 2004, Franklin was awarded one of Massey College's first <a href="Adrienne%20Clarkson">Adrienne Clarkson</a> Laureateships, honoring outstanding achievement in public service. She was inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame</a> in 2012. She received honorary degrees from more than a dozen Canadian universities including a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Science">Doctor of Science</a> from <a href="Queen%27s%20University">Queen's University</a> and a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctor of Humane Letters</a> from <a href="Mount%20Saint%20Vincent%20University">Mount Saint Vincent University</a>, both awarded in 1985.

William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros

William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros (c. 1370 – 1 November 1414) was a medieval English <a href="English%20peerage">nobleman</a>, politician and soldier. The second son of <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ros%2C%204th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros</a> and <a href="Beatrice%20Stafford">Beatrice Stafford</a>, William inherited his father's <a href="Feudal%20baron">barony</a> and estates (with extensive lands centred on <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>) in 1394. He married Margaret, daughter of Baron Fitzalan, shortly afterwards. The Fitzalan family, like that of de Ros, was well-connected at the local and national level. They were implacably opposed to <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">King Richard II</a>, and this may have soured Richard's opinion of the young de Ros.

The late 14th century was a period of political crisis in England. Richard II confiscated the estates of his cousin, <a href="Henry%20Bolingbroke">Henry Bolingbroke</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a>, in 1399 and exiled him. Bolingbroke invaded England several months later, and de Ros took his side almost immediately. Richard's support had deserted him; de Ros was alongside Henry when Richard surrendered his throne to the invader, and later voted in the House of Lords for the former king's imprisonment. De Ros benefited by the new <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrian regime</a>, achieving far more than he had ever done under Richard. He became an important aide and counsellor to King Henry, and regularly spoke for him in parliament. He also supported Henry in his military campaigns, participating in the <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20Scotland%20%281400%29">invasion of Scotland</a> in 1400 and assisting in the suppression of <a href="Richard%20le%20Scrope">Richard le Scrope</a>'s rebellion five years later.

In return for his loyalty to the new regime, de Ros received extensive royal <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. This included lands, grants, <a href="ward%20%28law%29">wardships</a> and the right to arrange the wards' marriages. De Ros performed valuable service as an adviser and ambassador (perhaps most importantly to Henry, who was often in a state of near-penury; de Ros was a wealthy man, and regularly loaned the crown large amounts of money). Important as he was in government and the regions, de Ros was unable to avoid the tumultuous regional conflicts and feuds which were rife at this time. In 1411 he was involved in a land dispute with a powerful Lincolnshire neighbour, and narrowly escaped an ambush; he sought—and received—redress in parliament. Partly because of de Ros's restraint in not seeking the severe penalties available to him, he was described by a twentieth-century historian as a particularly wise and forbearing figure for his time.

King Henry IV died in 1413. De Ros did not long survive him, and played only a minor role in government during the last year of his life. He may have been out of favour with the new king, <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a>. Henry—as <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>—had fallen out with his father a few years before, and de Ros had supported King Henry over his son. William de Ros died in <a href="Belvoir%20Castle">Belvoir Castle</a> on 1 November 1414. His wife survived him by twenty-four years; his son and heir, <a href="John%20de%20Ros%2C%207th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">John</a>, was still a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">minor</a>. John later fought at <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Agincourt</a> in 1415, and died childless in France in 1421. The Barony de Ros was then inherited by William's second son, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ros%2C%208th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">Thomas</a>, who also died in military service in France seven years after his brother.

The exact date of William de Ros's birth is unknown. He was described in 1394 as about twenty-three years old, which would place his birth year around 1370. The de Roses were an important family in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, and the historian <a href="Chris%20Given-Wilson">Chris Given-Wilson</a> has described them as one of the greatest fourteenth-century baronial families to never receive an earldom. De Ros's father was <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ros%2C%204th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros</a>, who fought in the <a href="Hundred%20Years%20War">Hundred Years War</a> under <a href="King%20Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a> (particularly in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers">Poitiers campaign</a> of 1356). Several years before William's birth, King Edward instructed Thomas de Ros to remain with his army on his Irish estates "to prevent the loss and destruction of the country". Thomas married Beatrice, the widow of <a href="Maurice%20FitzGerald%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Desmond">Maurice Fitzgerald, Earl of Desmond</a> and daughter of the <a href="Ralph%20de%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">first Earl of Stafford</a>. He died in <a href="Uffington%2C%20Lincolnshire">Uffington, Lincolnshire</a> in June 1384, and his eldest son <a href="John%20de%20Ros%2C%205th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">John</a>—William's elder brother—inherited the title as fifth Baron de Ros.

De Ros also had two younger brothers, Robert and Thomas, "of whom nothing is known". John's career was brief. By 1382 he had married Mary, half-sister of the <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>. John fought for the new king, <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a> (heir of Edward III, who died in 1377), in the <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20Scotland%20%281385%29">1385–86 Scottish campaign</a> and with the <a href="Richard%20FitzAlan%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a> in France the following year. During the early 1390s, John made a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem; he died in <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a> on 6 August 1393, on his return journey to England. John and Mary had not produced an heir, and (although he was never expected to succeed to the barony) de Ros was next in line. He inherited as sixth Baron de Ros, by which time he had been <a href="knighthood">knighted</a> and appointed to the <a href="Privy%20Councillor">Privy Council</a>.

The de Ros estates were primarily in the east and north of England. William received <a href="Livery%23Sue%20one%27s%20livery">livery</a> of them in January 1384, which gave him an extensive sphere of influence around Lincolnshire, <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, and eastern Yorkshire. By this time, the estate had two <a href="dowager">dowager</a> baronesses to support: his deceased brother's wife Mary and their mother, Beatrice. Mary died within a year of her husband, and her extensive inheritance was divided among her <a href="House%20of%20Percy">Percy relations</a>. De Ros received her <a href="dower">dower</a> lands, which included the ancient <a href="Barony%20of%20Helmsley">Barony of Helmsley</a>. Beatrice, on the other hand, had outlived three husbands and would outlive William; she was assigned her dower lands in December 1384. This meant that de Ros would never hold a large swath of land, predominantly in the <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Riding of Yorkshire</a>.

De Ros received "<a href="seisin">seisin</a>" of his estates on 11 February 1394, which included custody of several <a href="Clifford%20family">Clifford family</a> estates; his sister had married <a href="Thomas%20de%20Clifford%2C%206th%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford</a> around 1379. He held the latter lands until <a href="John%20Clifford%2C%207th%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">their son</a> came of age around 1411. De Ros married Margaret, daughter of <a href="John%20Fitzalan%2C%201st%20Baron%20Arundel">John Fitzalan, 1st Baron Arundel</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20Maltravers">Eleanor Maltravers</a>, soon after he inherited. She was already in receipt of a 40-<a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">mark</a> <a href="annuity">annuity</a> from King Richard II because she had been in the <a href="Royal%20household">household</a> of Richard's recently deceased queen, <a href="Anne%20of%20Bohemia">Anne of Bohemia</a>. His wife gave de Ros what may have appeared to be a useful connection to the crown. Also useful to William was the fact that his wife's father had recently died, so de Ros now had the <a href="Richard%20Fitzalan%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a> as a brother-in-law. His new connections and the higher political profile they brought may account for the royal grants he soon received of Clifford <a href="manor">manor</a>s in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Worcestershire. These had been the dower lands of Euphemia (widow of Robert, Lord Clifford), who had died in November 1393. De Ros attended the king's wedding to his second wife—the <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">French King's</a> daughter, <a href="Isabella%20of%20Valois">Isabella of Valois</a>—in <a href="Calais">Calais</a> in December 1396. His wife's grandfather died the following year, and she became Lady Maltravers "<a href="suo%20jure">suo jure</a>".

Although de Ros received some royal favour, Charles Ross has suggested that he may not have been doing as well as expected for a man in his position. Ross suggests that William's Fitzalan connections might have worked against him with the king. Arundel was a staunch <a href="Lord%20Appellant">political opponent of Richard's</a>, and de Ros's marrying into this politically unpopular family may account for the few offices the king granted him. "It seems strange", says Ross, "that a wealthy young lord, who later proved himself both active and able in the royal service, had no public, and very little local employment during the later years of Richard II". De Ros's situation would not change until the accession of Arundel's political ally, <a href="Henry%20Bolingbroke">Henry Bolingbroke</a>, as King Henry IV in 1399. He was rarely appointed to <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">peace commissions</a> and did not sit on many "<a href="oyer%20and%20Terminer">oyer and Terminer</a>" arrays, even in his own counties.

John of Gaunt—the most powerful noble in the country and second only to the crown in wealth—died in February 1399. Bolingbroke and King Richard had fallen out the previous year, and Richard had exiled Bolingbroke for six years the previous September. Instead of allowing Bolingbroke to succeed to his father's estates and titles, says Given-Wilson, Richard "succumb[ed] to the temptation" to confiscate the Duchy of Lancaster. Richard proclaimed that Bolingbroke's exile was now a life sentence, and cancelled his writs of seisin. He further decreed that Bolingbroke could only request his inheritance at the <a href="king%27s%20pleasure">king's pleasure</a>. Bolingbroke, in Paris, joined forces with the also-exiled <a href="Thomas%20Arundel">Thomas Arundel</a>. Arundel had been <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and was de Ros's wife's uncle; he lost his office because of his involvement with the <a href="Lords%20Appellant">Lords Appellant</a>, and been exiled since 1397. With Arundel and a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at <a href="Ravenspur">Ravenspur</a> in Yorkshire in late June 1399. De Ros, bringing a large <a href="retinue">retinue</a>, joined Bolingbroke's army almost immediately (as did much of the northern nobility). Richard was <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20Ireland%20%281399%29">campaigning in Ireland</a> at the time, and unable to defend his throne. Henry initially announced that he intended only to reclaim his rights as <a href="Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a>, although he quickly gained enough power and support (including that of de Ros) to claim the throne in Richard's stead and have himself proclaimed King Henry IV. In June, de Ros was present at <a href="Berkeley%20Castle">Berkeley Castle</a> when Henry and Richard met for the first time since Henry was exiled; de Ros witnessed their final meeting on 6 September at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, when Richard resigned the throne. Bolingbroke's accession as Henry IV saw an uplift in de Ros's fortunes and those of the Fitzalans. De Ros now had strong connections with important figures at <a href="Royal%20court">court</a> and a relatively close friendship with the new king. In contrast to his treatment by Richard, de Ros's previous loyal service to Henry—and the king's father—earned him significant <a href="Patronage">royal patronage</a>. In the first parliament of the new reign—held at Westminster in October 1399—he was appointed a <a href="Trier%20of%20fact">Trier of Petitions</a>, and was one of the lords who voted to imprison Richard (who later died in <a href="Pontefract%20Castle">Pontefract Castle</a> of unknown causes). De Ros's new position at the centre of government was highlighted in December 1399, when he was appointed to Henry's first <a href="royal%20council">royal council</a>.

De Ros's motives for joining Bolingbroke's invasion so swiftly are unknown but, says Given-Wilson, this should be no surprise; for most of Henry's new-found allies, "it is only possible to speculate as to their political allegiance". De Ros may have felt generally aggrieved by Richard's poor treatment of Gaunt and Bolingbroke, and his own lack of promotion under Richard was doubtless influential. Whatever his reasons were for rebelling in 1399, de Ros and his father had been Lancastrian (rather than Ricardian) in their loyalties. His father had been one of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt's</a> earliest retainers when the young Gaunt was <a href="Earl%20of%20Richmond">Earl of Richmond</a>, and de Ros had also been retained by Gaunt in the late fourteenth century. Service to the duke had involved de Ros accompanying the duke abroad and travelling on his business on at least five occasions in the last years of Gaunt's life. For his services de Ros received annuities of £40 to £50, and was one of only two <a href="knight%20banneret">knights banneret</a> whom Gaunt retained.
De Ros was an active royal official in the local administration and became a leading member of political society in the north <a href="The%20Midlands">Midlands</a> and Yorkshire, where he regularly headed royal commissions. He was frequently appointed a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>, particularly in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>. De Ros's service to the crown was not confined to the regions; in 1401, he directed the king's attempts to increase the royal income. He was appointed Henry's negotiator with the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, to persuade the Commons to agree to a subsidy for the king's intended <a href="English%20invasion%20of%20Scotland%20%281400%29">invasion of Scotland</a> later that summer. De Ros and the Commons representatives met in <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a>'s refectory. Emphasising "favourable consideration" the Commons would receive from the king, he played heavily on the king's expenses in defending the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Marches">Scottish Marches</a>. Each party was wary of the other; the king did not wish to set a precedent, and the Commons were traditionally wary of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Six years later, de Ros played much the same role—with the <a href="Edward%20of%20Norwich%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a> and the Archbishop of Canterbury, on a committee hearing the Commons' complaints. The result of these discussions was an altercation in which the Commons, reports the <a href="Rolls%20of%20Parliament">parliament roll</a>, were "hugely disturbed". This disturbance, according to <a href="James%20Hamilton%20Wylie">J. H. Wylie</a>, was probably the result of something de Ros said and would account for the Commons' reluctance to meet him or his committee. De Ros's remit was to persuade the Commons to grant as substantial a tax—in exchange for as few liberties granted—as possible. An experienced parliamentarian, he attended most parliaments from 1394 to 1413.

Almost from the beginning of his reign, Henry faced problems. Most stemmed from financial insecurity, since by 1402 his treasury was empty. Around this time, de Ros was appointed <a href="Lord%20Treasurer">Lord Treasurer</a>. Charles Ross suggests that this demonstrated the king's increased confidence in de Ros, who occupied the post for the next four years. He was unable to substantially improve Henry's financial situation, and relations with the Commons worsened. During the <a href="Unlearned%20Parliament">1404 parliament</a>, <a href="Speaker%20%28politics%29">speaker</a> <a href="Arnold%20Savage">Arnold Savage</a> confronted the king over his lack of money (and repeated demands for taxation), which Savage said could be ameliorated by reducing the number of annuities paid by the crown. Savage also condemned an unnamed crown minister for owing royal creditors over £6,000. The House of Commons' dissatisfaction was obvious to the king, who responded within the week. He despatched de Ros, accompanied by <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a> <a href="Henry%20Beaufort">Henry Beaufort</a>, to the Commons with a comprehensive breakdown of the king's financial requirements. According to <a href="Ian%20Mortimer%20%28historian%29">Ian Mortimer</a>, "Savage, having attacked royal policy in the King's presence, had no compunction about speaking his mind to the chancellor and treasurer". Henry's government continued to subsist on poor revenues. As Given-Wilson put it, the treasury became "largely reliant on a diminishing circle of the faithful" (which included de Ros). He made numerous loans to the king, and temporarily surrendered his councillor's salary for the sake of the royal finances.

De Ros also performed extensive military service. In 1400, he <a href="indenture">contracted</a> with the king to bring a fully crewed ship of twenty <a href="men%20at%20arms">men at arms</a> and forty archers to Henry's Scottish invasion. Although the campaign fizzled out, de Ros played a part in it. Returning to Westminster, he resumed his office of councillor and participated in Henry's <a href="Magnum%20Concilium">Great Council</a> the following year. In 1402 <a href="Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Owain Glyndŵr</a> <a href="Glynd%C5%B5r%20Rising">rebelled</a>, which impacted de Ros personally. His brother-in-law, <a href="Reginald%20Grey%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Grey%20de%20Ruthyn">Reginald, Lord Grey of Ruthin</a>—who had married de Ros's youngest sister, Margaret—was captured and imprisoned by Glyndŵr; personal animosity between Grey and Glyndŵr may have been to blame for the outbreak of the rebellion. The Welsh demanded a 10,000-mark ransom from the king, who agreed to pay. De Ros, because of his relationship to Grey, also agreed to contribute and led the commission which negotiated with Glyndŵr over its payment and his brother-in-law's release. A friend of de Ros, fellow Midlands baron <a href="Robert%20Willoughby%2C%204th%20Baron%20Willoughby%20de%20Eresby">Robert, Lord Willoughby</a>, accompanied him in the negotiations.
De Ros was also elected to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a> in 1402, and was granted an annuity of 100 marks a year as the king's <a href="Retainer%20%28medieval%29">retainer</a> two years later. In May of that year another <a href="Northern%20Rising%20%281405%29">rebellion</a> broke out in the north, led by <a href="Richard%20le%20Scrope">Richard Scrope, Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and the disaffected Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. One of their first acts was to kidnap the king's envoy. De Ros was part of an extensive network of north Lancastrian loyalists who gathered around the king's cousin <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland</a> to suppress the rebellion. Henry entrusted de Ros to meet with Westmorland, commander of the king's armies in the north. De Ros was probably chosen because of the king's intimate advisors, his local knowledge would have been the most valuable. The mission was a success; de Ros witnessed the Earl of Northumberland surrendering <a href="Berwick%20Castle">Berwick Castle</a> to the king, and sat on the commission which condemned Scrope to death without trial in early June 1405. When the king arrived in York to oversee the execution of the rebels, de Ros brought Percy's bonds to him.

Since de Ros had been instructed only to engage the rebels on the king's express instruction, it is difficult to ascertain the role that he and Gascoigne played in the rebellion's suppression. Unlike the Earl of Westmorland, "no more is heard of their activities" in the north until after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shipton%20Moor">confrontation at Shipton Moor</a>. De Ros's role may have been to oversee the later judicial commissions over the rebels, and he was authorised to <a href="Royal%20pardon">pardon</a> those who rejected rebellion and wished to return to the king's grace. The fact that so little of their work remains visible to historians may suggest surreptitiousness; possibly, says Given-Wilson, they were little more than spies tailing their prey until the king's main army caught up.

The following year, the king's health (which had not been strong for some time) broke down for good. At the <a href="English%20parliament">parliament</a> of 1406, Henry IV agreed that since it was clear that poor health prevented him from ruling, a Grand Council should be established to assist him in governing. Although de Ros was on the original list presented to parliament of those to be appointed to the council, how long he served is subject to conjecture. He was attending its meetings in late 1406 (since he was an unofficial "chaperone" for his successor as Lord Treasurer, <a href="Thomas%20Nevill%2C%205th%20Baron%20Furnivall">Lord Furnivall</a>), and may have still been on the council the following June. De Ros regularly witnessed royal charters, and continued his role as the king's spokesman to the Commons. He probably assisted the Lord Chancellor through an increasingly difficult and uncertain period (due to the King's ill-health), but it is uncertain whether he chose—or was instructed—to do so.

For the duration of Henry's reign, de Ros was "high in the King's confidence and enjoyed especially trusted positions". The historian Mark Arvanigian summarises de Ros's position as "clearly a reliable and trusted servant, as well as being a reasonably talented administrator and royal councillor". Henry continued relying on loans to carry out policy, and de Ros's loan funded the Calais garrison. Unlike many—and indicating the favour with which the King held him in—de Ros was promised repayment, manifested in the royal patronage he continued to receive. By 1409, for example, he had been appointed to the lucrative positions of master forester and constable of <a href="Pickering%20Castle">Pickering Castle</a>. These offices strengthened his influence in the region, allowed him to appoint deputies, and gave him other patronage of his own to dispense. In October of that year, de Ros paid £80 for the custody of Giffard family lands in the <a href="South%20Midlands">South Midlands</a>. <a href="John%20Tuchet%2C%204th%20Baron%20Audley">John Tuchet, Lord Audley</a> died in December, and de Ros was granted Audley's lands while the Audley heir was a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">minor</a>. De Ros also paid £2,000 for the right to arrange the heir's marriage. The Audley estates from which de Ros intended to get his money back were greatly overvalued, and he was charged only half the original amount. These grants were in addition to his annual conciliar salary of £100, and he held the manor of <a href="Chingford">Chingford</a> to <a href="Barracks">quarter</a> himself and his men when he was regularly in the south on royal business. De Ros remained an active councillor and undertook significant military and diplomatic roles. He was one of Henry's few advisors whom, even when the king's council was not sitting, remained a close counsellor.

De Ros remained in the King's favour through the final years of Henry's reign. As a trusted counsellor, in 1410 he participated in what has been described as "a show trial of national importance". The previous year, an <a href="ecclesiastical%20court">ecclesiastical court</a> had found <a href="John%20Badby">John Badby</a> of <a href="Evesham">Evesham</a> guilty of <a href="Lollardy">Lollardy</a>. According to church custom, Badby had been given a year's grace to recant. He refused; if anything, his opinions were more entrenched than before. On 1 March 1410, Badby was brought before a <a href="convocation">convocation</a> at the <a href="Friars-Preachers">Friars-Preachers</a> House. De Ros and his fellow barons found Badby guilty and passed secular judgement. He was <a href="Death%20by%20burning">burnt to death</a> (possibly, according to sixteenth-century <a href="martyrologist">martyrologist</a> <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a>, in a <a href="barrel">barrel</a>) in <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a>.

After the death of the <a href="Edmund%20Stafford%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">Earl of Stafford</a> in 1403 (whose infant <a href="Humphrey%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">heir</a> had a twenty-year minority), de Ros was the leading baron in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. He was responsible for upholding the <a href="Queen%27s%20peace">king's peace</a> during a period that has been a <a href="Byword%20%28saying%29">by-word</a> for the kind of pervasive lawlessness that de Ros, like all regional magnates, was expected to suppress. Particularly well-known is the frequency with which the baronage and gentry indulged in internecine fighting. In 1411, his intervention averted a tense situation which was likely to erupt into armed conflict between local gentry Alexander Mering and John Tuxford. This was only a temporary ceasefire, however; the following year, de Ros sponsored a second arbitration between the parties with which they promised to abide on pain of a 500-mark fine. In early 1411 <a href="Walter%20Tailboys">Sir Walter Tailboys</a> caused a riot in <a href="Lincoln%2C%20England">Lincoln</a>, attacked the <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>s, killed two men, and lay in wait outside the city in ambush (preventing its residents from leaving). Lincoln's citizens petitioned the king for justice and explicitly requested that de Ros and his kinsman, <a href="Henry%20Beaumont%2C%205th%20Baron%20Beaumont">Lord Beaumont</a>, be appointed to investigate. They found in favour of the Lincoln citizenry and, reflecting the severity of Tailboy's offence, he was <a href="Binding%20over">bound over</a> to keep the peace for £3,000. Due to such efforts, <a href="Simon%20Payling">Simon Payling</a> has suggested that de Ros's "reputation for fair-mindedness" made him a popular figure for settling gentry disputes.
Despite his aptitude for dispute resolution, de Ros was not exempt from local conflict. He became involved in a dispute with his Lincolnshire neighbour, Sir <a href="Robert%20Tirwhit">Robert Tirwhit</a>, in 1411. Tirwhit was a newly appointed royal justice and a well-known figure in the county. He and de Ros fell out over conflicting claims to <a href="Common%20land">common grazing</a> and associated hay-mowing and turf-digging rights in <a href="Wrawby">Wrawby</a>. An <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a> took place before Justice <a href="William%20Gascoigne">William Gascoigne</a>, who ordered a <a href="Loveday%20%28arbitration%29">Loveday</a> arranged. The Loveday was intended to offer both parties the opportunity to demonstrate their support for the arbitration process; the two men were expected to attend with companions (or followers), keeping their numbers to a minimum. Tirwhit, however, brought a small army of about 500 men. Later justifying the size, he claimed not to have agreed to the Loveday in the first place. De Ros kept to the arrangement "vis á vis" his retinue, bringing with him only Lords Beaumont and <a href="Thomas%20la%20Warr%2C%205th%20Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">de la Warre</a> (the latter, like Beaumont, a relative).

He and his companions escaped Tirwhit's ambush unharmed. Given-Wilson has argued that, although the case was not uncommon in its basic facts, "the personal involvement of a royal justice in such a calculated act of violence, and the status of the protagonists, clearly gave it an interest above the usual". On 4 November 1411, de Ros <a href="petition">petition</a>ed parliament—at which he was appointed a Trier of Petitions—for satisfaction. The case was heard before the <a href="Richard%20Grey%2C%204th%20Baron%20Grey%20of%20Codnor">Lord Chamberlain</a> and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and took over three weeks to determine. The Chamberlain and Archbishop requested the attendance of de Ros and all the "knyghtes and Esquiers and Yomen that had ledynge of men" for him. After deliberating, they found firmly in de Ros's favour. Tirwhit was bound to give de Ros a quantity of <a href="French%20wine%23South%20West%20France">Gascon wine</a> and provide the food and drink for the next Loveday, where he would publicly apologise to de Ros. In his apology, Tirwhit acknowledged that a nobleman of de Ros's position could also have brought an army and he had shown forbearance in not doing so. The only responsibility de Ros was given as part of the arbitration award was that at the second Loveday, he would provide the entertainment.

Although the King's health continued to decline, he improved sufficiently in 1411 to direct the formation of a new council of his loyal councillors; this intentionally excluded <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">his son, Prince Henry</a> and the prince's associates, Henry and <a href="Thomas%20Beaufort%2C%20Duke%20of%20Exeter">Thomas Beaufort</a>, from power. De Ros—the "reliable royalist"—sat on the council for the next fifteen months with other "unswervingly loyal" officials, such as the Bishops of <a href="Thomas%20Langley">Durham</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20Bubwith">Bath and Wells</a> and the <a href="Henry%20Bowet">Archbishop of York</a>. De Ros and the others now signed administrative documents which had required the king's <a href="signet%20ring">signet</a> seal. <a href="A.%20L.%20Brown">A. L. Brown</a> and <a href="Henry%20Summerson">Henry Summerson</a>, two of the king's recent biographers, note that "at the end of his reign, as at its beginning, Henry placed his trust principally in his Lancastrian retainers".

Henry IV died on 20 March 1413. William de Ros played no significant role in government from then on, after probably attending his last council meeting in 1412. Charles Ross posits that he was "no particular favourite" of the new king, Henry V, which Ross attributed to Henry V's distrust of his father's loyalists (who, in his eyes, kept him from what he felt was his rightful position at the head of government during his father's illness). Whether or not Henry excluded him from the government, de Ros lived only eighteen months into the new reign. His mother had drawn up her <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a> in January 1414, of which de Ros was an <a href="executor">executor</a>. Early that year, de Ros sat on a final anti-<a href="Lollard">Lollard</a> commission and was tasked with investigating the murder of an <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> in the Midlands.

De Ros died in <a href="Belvoir%20Castle">Belvoir Castle</a> on 1 November 1414. He had drawn up his will two years earlier, and added a <a href="Codicil%20%28will%29">codicil</a> in February 1414. He died a wealthy man, with one of Yorkshire's highest <a href="disposable%20income">disposable income</a>s.

Three of William de Ros's children fought in the last period of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281415%E2%80%9353%29">Hundred Years' War</a>. John, his heir, was born in 1397 and was legally a minor when de Ros died. The <a href="John%20Holland%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Exeter">Earl of Dorset</a>, the king's cousin, received custody of the de Ros estates. Before he inherited, John travelled to France with the new king in 1415 and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a> at the age of seventeen or eighteen. He died in 1421 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baug%C3%A9">Battle of Baugé</a> with the king's brother, <a href="Thomas%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Thomas, Duke of Clarence</a> and Sir <a href="Gilbert%20Umfraville">Gilbert Umfraville</a>. William de Ros's second son <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ros%2C%208th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">Thomas</a> was only fourteen at John's death, and fought with <a href="Thomas%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Thomas, Earl of Salisbury</a> at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Siege of Orléans</a> in 1428; he died after a skirmish outside Paris two years later. Thomas' heir (also named <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ros%2C%209th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">Thomas</a>) inherited the lordship as 9th baron and played an important role in the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> fighting for the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrian</a> king, <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>; he was <a href="Decapitation">beheaded</a> after his defeat by the <a href="House%20of%20York">Yorkists</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hedgeley%20Moor">Battle of Hedgeley Moor</a> in 1464. De Ros's wife, Margaret Fitzalan, lived until 1438. She had received her dower by February 1415 and, at the marriage of Henry V to <a href="Katherine%20of%20Valois">Katherine of Valois</a> in 1420, entered the new queen's service as a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a>. Margaret attended Katherine's coronation and travelled with her to see Henry in France two years later.

With his wife, Margaret Fitzalan, William de Ros had four sons: John, Thomas, Robert and Richard. They also had four daughters: Beatrice, Alice, Margaret and Elizabeth. De Ros also had an illegitimate son, John, by a now-unknown woman. Charles Ross suggests that he "provides full confirmation of what the scanty evidence as to the character of his earlier career suggests, that Ros was a man of just and equitable temperament" by the nature and extent of his bequests. His heir, <a href="John%20de%20Ros%2C%207th%20Baron%20de%20Ros">John</a>, inherited his father's lordship and <a href="Property">patrimony</a> and his armour and a gold sword. His third son, Robert—whom Ross describes as "evidently his favourite"—also inherited a quantity of land. De Ros made this provision for Robert from John's patrimony, a decision described by <a href="G.%20L.%20Harriss">G. L. Harriss</a> as "overrid[ing] both family duty and convention". His younger three sons (Thomas, Robert, and Richard) received a third of de Ros's goods among them; Thomas, traditional for a younger son, was intended for an ecclesiastical career. De Ros's wife, Margaret, received another third of his goods. His illegitimate son, John, received £40 towards his upkeep. Loyal retainers received benefices, and de Ros's "humbler dependents"—for instance, the poor on his Lincolnshire estates—received often-massive sums among them. His executors—one of whom was his heir, John—received £20 each for their services. De Ros was buried in <a href="Belvoir%20Priory">Belvoir Priory</a>, and an <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> <a href="effigy">effigy</a> was erected in <a href="St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin%27s%20Church%2C%20Bottesford">St Mary the Virgin's Church, Bottesford</a>, on the right side of the altar. Seven years later, after his death at Baugé, an effigy of his son John was placed on the left. William de Ros left £400 to pay ten chaplains for eight years to educate his sons.

William de Ros appears in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>" as Lord Ross. His character performs a <a href="double%20act">double act</a> of sorts with Lord Willoughby in their (ultimately successful) attempts to persuade the Earl of Northumberland to revolt against Richard, although as one reviewer has noted, indicating "little sense of rebels carefully testing the political water" before doing so. Together, the three of them are the core of the conspiracy to overthrow Richard. In their colloquies—for which R. F. Hill has compared them to a <a href="Senecan%20tragedy">Senecan</a> <a href="Greek%20chorus">Chorus</a> they provide the audience with a catalogue of Richard's misdeeds by re-telling his history of poor governance. Ross, says Hill, is "lured" by the earl into conversation, which results in their plotting. Ross tells Northumberland, "The commons hath [King Richard] pill'd with grievous taxes / And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined / For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts" and is portrayed as an overt follower of Henry Bolingbroke from the beginning. Shakespeare has this discussion take place in the north; in this way, says Hill, their separation from the King emphasises their geographical closeness to Bolingbroke.

The speed with which Ross deserts Richard and joins Henry is in stark contrast to the themes of loyalty and honour that the play deals with suggests <a href="Margaret%20Shewring">Margaret Shewring</a>. Described by Shakespeare (based on <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s chronicle) as "fiery-red with haste", Ross joins Bolingbroke at <a href="Berkeley%2C%20Gloucestershire">Berkeley, Gloucestershire</a>. In 1738—when the public image of the King, <a href="George%20I%20of%20England">George I</a>, was poor—the play was put on by <a href="John%20Rich%20%28producer%29">John Rich</a>, in the knowledge that it was "dangerously topical in terms of contemporary politics". The discussion between Ross, Willoughby and Northumberland on the faults of the King—"basely led/by flatterers"—has been argued to have reflected contemporary disfavour with George, who was widely believed to be under the influence of his chief minister, <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>. a contemporary, <a href="Thomas%20Davies%20%28bookseller%29">Thomas Davies</a>, watched the performance and later wrote how "almost every line that was spoken to the occurrences of the time, and to the measures and character of the ministry". 

The text of "Richard II" is often cut by directors, either to tighten the plot or to avoid problems with weak casting, and the role of Lord Ross is occasionally omitted. For example, in the 1981 <a href="Bard%20Productions">Bard Productions</a> film, Ross' part was given to the Exton character, and in the Erickson-Farrell 2001 film, Ross was one of seven characters dropped, his part again given to Exton. He has still been played by several actors in post-war performances. At the 1947 <a href="Avignon%20Festival">Avignon Festival</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Lautrec">Pierre Lautrec</a> played to <a href="Jean%20Vilar">Jean Vilar</a>'s Richard; Vilar also directed the play. The same year, <a href="Walter%20Hudd">Walter Hudd</a> directed it with the <a href="Shakespeare%20Memorial%20Theatre">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</a>'s at <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, with <a href="Joss%20Ackland">Joss Ackland</a> as Ross to <a href="Robert%20Harris%20%28British%20actor%29">Robert Harris</a>' Richard.

Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is the second game in the "Kingdom Hearts" series. It is a direct <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20%28video%20game%29">Kingdom Hearts</a>", and its ending is set about a year before "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>". The game follows <a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a> and friends, exploring a mysterious castle. There, <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Riku">Riku</a> explores the basement levels and fights the darkness. The game introduces new characters and plotlines that further expand the "Kingdom Hearts" universe and set up the premise for "Kingdom Hearts II".

Though not as successful as the other "Kingdom Hearts" games, it received positive reviews and sold well. It was praised for its story, <a href="computer%20graphics">graphics</a>, and FMVs. The game features a new <a href="collectible%20card%20game">card-based battle system</a> that is a departure from its predecessor. When it debuted in Japan, it sold 104,000 units in 48 hours.

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is a combination between a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> and <a href="collectible%20card%20game">collectible card game</a>. The main role-playing aspect is an <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a> system that is used to increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an <a href="Isometric%20projection">isometric</a> area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.

A unique aspect to this game is "room synthesis": to advance through the game, the player must utilize Map cards obtained after winning battles to synthesize rooms. The properties of each room―including quality of items and strength of enemies―are determined by the Map cards that the player chooses. Each card has a specific effect: red cards affect the number and type of enemies; green cards affect the power of the player's deck; and blue cards affect the properties of the room itself, such as allowing treasure chests or a <a href="saved%20game">save point</a> to appear.

The game features three modes of gameplay. The first two are story modes that feature either Sora or Riku, and the third is a two player battle mode. Initially only Sora's story mode is available; once completed, "Reverse/Rebirth" mode becomes available. Reverse/Rebirth allows the player to play a second story mode featuring Riku and a link mode where players can battle each other via a <a href="Game%20Link%20Cable">Game Link Cable</a>.

Combat uses a card-based battle system executed in real time. The player can jump and maneuver around the battle screen as they would on the field map, but all physical attacks, magic, items and summonings are activated by playing cards. Cards are ranked from zero to nine, and are used for making attack combos or breaking enemy cards. With the exception of zero-ranked cards which are more expensive in terms of Card Points (CP) compared to other cards of the same type and have other ranks, more CP are required to place higher-ranked cards in the player's deck. Card Points—increased through <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">level up</a>—limit the number of cards the player can use in a deck. Cards with rank "zero" can break any opposing card or combo if played after the opposing card or combo, but they can be broken by any card or combo as well if it is played after the zero card is played. Breaking an opposing card will cancel that attack and stun the loser of a card break for a short time. Special enemy cards may be obtained by defeating enemies and bosses, and are used to give the player a temporary ability, ranging from enhanced offensive and defensive capabilities to modifying the attributes of certain cards.

Combining cards in sets of three will create combo attacks that are usually more difficult to break because the rank of the combo will be the sum of the ranks of the three cards in the combo. Certain card combinations will create a "sleight", a special combination that will create a powerful physical attack, magical spell, or summon attack. When the player runs out of cards, the deck must be reloaded. Additionally, using a card combination will cause the first card in the combo to become unusable until the end of combat.

Sora's and Riku's stories differ gameplay-wise in several ways. In Sora's story, Sora obtains cards by defeating enemies or through <a href="Moogle">Moogle</a> Shops. In some cases, Sora must earn the specific card first through a plot event before it becomes available. Sora can create and store three different decks in the pause menu. Unlike Sora, Riku has a closed deck that cannot be customized. The cards in his deck change depending on the world in which he is traveling. Riku is limited to mainly physical attacks, enemy cards and Mickey Mouse ally cards. He can activate "dark mode" and unlock his sleight attacks if he accumulates enough "dark points". Dark points are earned by breaking enemy cards and combos, and the difference between Riku's card or combo and the enemy's card or combo is how many dark points he will accumulate for that card break.

"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" is set immediately after the events of the first game. It is set in Castle Oblivion, a mysterious castle kept by Lord <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Marluxia">Marluxia</a>. Sora and his teammates are told that the castle causes visitors to lose their memories upon entering. The lobby and areas between floors are white with flower-themed decorations, but each floor can be transformed into a different world from the first "Kingdom Hearts" game using "world cards" created from Sora's memories. Like before, many of the worlds of Disney and Square Enix reappear.

Unlike the previous game, the worlds are created from Sora's memories. As such, many of the events experienced in "Kingdom Hearts" are relived in this game, Sora encounters memory-based versions of Disney characters that he has met before (except Deep Jungle in "<a href="Tarzan%20%281999%20film%29">Tarzan</a>"). The individual plotlines differ from those in the original game and revolve around the theme of memory. Just as "Kingdom Hearts" had several worlds created specifically for that game, "Chain of Memories" introduces Twilight Town as a world created from memories on "<a href="Roxas%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">the other side of Sora's heart</a>", in addition to the original worlds of "Kingdom Hearts".

<a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a> returns as the game's protagonist. <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a> and <a href="Goofy">Goofy</a> are less involved in the gameplay and story. Like the first game, "Chain of Memories" features numerous characters from both the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series and the <a href="List%20of%20Disney%20animated%20features">Disney animated features canon</a>. Being a direct sequel, many of the characters from the first "Kingdom Hearts" reappear in this game. As each world and the related characters are recreated from Sora's memories, they interact with Sora as if they had never met before. The game also introduces a handful of new characters. Several are members of the enigmatic <a href="Organization%20XIII">Organization</a>. Other new characters include <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Namin%C3%A9">Naminé</a>, a young girl capable of manipulating memories, and <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Ansem%20the%20Wise">DiZ</a>, a mysterious man concealed by red robes and bandages. <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Riku">Riku</a> appears as a playable character in the second story mode. After being sealed in the realm of darkness, Riku heads to the basement of Castle Oblivion, aided by King <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and DiZ.

Six members of the Organization serve as antagonists; four appear in Sora's story mode, and the other two in Riku's. Among the four Sora encounters are <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Marluxia">Marluxia</a>, the lord of Castle Oblivion; <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Larxene">Larxene</a>, Marluxia's assistant; <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Axel">Axel</a>, a double agent with hidden loyalty; and <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Vexen">Vexen</a>, Marluxia's unwilling collaborator. Conversely, Riku battles <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Zexion">Zexion</a> and <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Lexaeus">Lexaeus</a>, Vexen's allies. <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Xehanort">Ansem</a> also appears in Riku's story as an entity that attempts to control Riku. Many of the Disney villains return via memory-based recreations like the rest of the Disney characters.

Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket walk down a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive fortress called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper they go into the castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.

Sora ascends the castle, facing off against other hooded figures who form a group called "the Organization" along the way. As Sora loses his memories, he gradually appears to remember a girl named Naminé as an old friend of his, and learns from Organization member Larxene that she is being held prisoner in the castle. He also clashes with a replica of Riku created and controlled by another Organization member, Vexen, and believed by both Sora and the replica himself to be the real Riku. Axel, an Organization <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a>, releases Naminé and allows her to meet Sora in person. Sora discovers Naminé to be the one manipulating his memories, having been forced to do so by Marluxia, the lord of Castle Oblivion and the figure who lured Sora there, as part of his plan to overthrow the rest of the Organization with Larxene. Sora climbs to the highest floor and defeats Marluxia, after which Naminé puts Sora and his friends into pod-like machines to help them regain the memories they have lost, even though they will forget the events that transpired in the castle. Before they are put to sleep, Sora and Naminé promise to meet again as real friends once he reawakens, Sora firmly believing that his memories of her and the castle will remain in his heart despite being forgotten.

In "Reverse/Rebirth", which occurs congruently with the game's main story, Riku is transported from the realm of darkness to Castle Oblivion's deepest basement, and he fights figments of previous enemies to combat his inner darkness as he climbs upwards. Vexen fights Riku to obtain his data and creates his replica to counter Marluxia's plan. Ansem, still possessing Riku's body, tries to regain control of Riku, but Mickey's power keeps Ansem at bay. On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, a member of Vexen's circle, only to be dragged into the realm of darkness. However, he is saved by Mickey when Ansem nearly succeeds in taking Riku's body as his own. With Marluxia eliminated by this time, another of Vexen's allies, Zexion, attempts to dispose of Riku by drowning him in light. Riku is saved by Naminé disguised as Kairi, who helps him to control his darkness, allowing him to defeat Zexion. Riku later meets DiZ, an enigmatic individual interested in Riku who sends him to find Naminé. Riku's replica, who has since learned of his altered memories, seeks to justify his existence by killing Riku, only to be destroyed by him. Riku chooses to face Ansem upon learning from Naminé that Ansem lives in his heart, and defeats him after DiZ summons him for Riku to fight. Riku then sets out on a journey to utilize both his darkness and his light with Mickey as his companion.

The idea for an intermediary title was developed after director <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> and his team had already begun to develop ideas for the second "Kingdom Hearts" game, which he had intended to be set a year after the original. Originally titled "Kingdom Hearts: Lost Memories", Nomura changed the name to match the overall outline of the story, while still reflecting the theme of memories. "Chain of Memories" was developed to bridge the gap between "Kingdom Hearts" and "Kingdom Hearts II". Like most sequels, "Kingdom Hearts II" was planned to have the character start from the beginning, ability-wise. To explain the loss of abilities gained in the previous game, Nomura had the story revolve around Sora's memories getting corrupted and implemented the card battle system to symbolize Sora's various memories.

Nomura was hesitant about releasing a "Kingdom Hearts" title on the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, feeling that the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. Nomura changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play "Kingdom Hearts" on the GBA. After exploring ideas for the gameplay, he felt that a 2D "Kingdom Hearts" game would be possible, and that it could still feel like and play like what gamers were used to in the original. Meanwhile, Nomura wanted to give the game a "lighter tone" than the PlayStation 2 games.

"Chain of Memories" was announced along with "Kingdom Hearts II" at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> in September 2003. Initial details included the switch to 2D graphics, the use of cards to perform attacks, and that compressed movies would be utilized in some <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s. The cut scene animations were rendered using the graphical engine of the PlayStation 2 iteration and then encoded for the Game Boy Advance by using a technology developed by Japanese company, AM3. To help market the game, Disney and Square Enix launched official Japanese websites. A playable demo was first made available to the public at the 2003 <a href="Jump%20Festa">Jump Festa</a> in Japan; this demo and subsequent demos highlighted the card-based combat system. Aside from information gathered from the opening sequences, most details regarding the story were kept secret until the release.

The card-based gameplay of "Chain of Memories" would later serve to inspire the gameplay of Jupiter's next game, "<a href="The%20World%20Ends%20with%20You">The World Ends with You</a>"; originally, the team envisioned a similar card game-based system taking place on the lower screen of the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, but eventually this morphed to a battle system taking place on both screens, with a card game controlled on the upper screen.

Much of the music from the original "Kingdom Hearts" is present in "Chain of Memories"; the main vocal theme for the Japanese release is , while the English version of "Hikari", "<a href="Simple%20And%20Clean">Simple And Clean</a>", is used in the Western releases. Additional and reworked tracks were created for its PlayStation 2 rerelease, "Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories". Since the music is reused from the original, a "Chain of Memories" soundtrack was never released. The new reworked tracks, however, are included on two <a href="CD">CD</a>s in the "<a href="Music%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Kingdom%20Hearts%20Original%20Soundtrack%20Complete">Kingdom Hearts Original Soundtrack Complete</a>".

Due to the technological limitations of the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from "Kingdom Hearts" were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: <a href="Keiji%20Fujiwara">Keiji Fujiwara</a> as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first "Kingdom Hearts" were inserted into "Chain of Memories". The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.

While the least successful in the series commercially, "Chain of Memories" received generally positive reviews and met with successful sales figures. In Japan, it sold 104,000 units in 48 hours, a record for a Game Boy Advance title at the time. Its positive debut sales placed it in the top spot of sales charts in Japan. In the first month of its North American release, it was ranked 1st on "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" ChartSpot for portable systems and 6th for all consoles. By February 2005, it had sold over one million copies in Japan and North America. Worldwide sales of the game reached 1.50 million copies by the end of 2006. In the United States alone, it sold 900,000 copies and earned $28 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 24th highest-selling game launched for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> or <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> in that country. As of August 2009, "Chain of Memories" has sold over 1.55 million copies worldwide, with 200,000 units in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, 410,000 units in Japan, and 940,000 units in North America.

The game received positive ratings from critics. The card-based battle system received mixed reviews. "GameSpot" called it "unwieldy", while <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> called it "engaging" and "Game Watch" called it original. Reviews also cited that the card battle system was awkward and made it difficult to plan strategies. <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> commented that the gameplay was well suited for portable play and that it successfully combined card battles and random dungeons, "two much-maligned RPG" elements. Some critics found the Room Synthesis to be far too linear. The most frequent praise went towards the story. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called it an "engrossing storyline that actually changes up after the adventure comes to an end" and rated the presentation a 10 out of 10.

The quality of the graphics was well received, particularly the cut scenes. IGN cited them as "wonderfully produced FMV sequences". "GameSpot" stated that the movies were true to the art style of the original and were on par with <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance%20Video">GBA video paks</a>. They also commented on the detailed and well animated game sprites. "Game Watch" described the event scenes as "high quality". Many critics stated that though the graphics were not as good as the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> predecessor, they were very good for a GBA game. G4 complimented the graphics stating that "Chain of Memories" was "one of the best-looking GBA games out there."

Like its predecessor, a great deal of merchandise was produced to help market the release of the game. Square Enix released two products to coincide with the release of the video game. The first was a limited edition "Kingdom Hearts" <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance%20SP">Game Boy Advance SP</a> set released only in Japan. The set contained the game, a "Kingdom deep silver" GBA SP with the "Kingdom Hearts" logo, and a carrying strap. The second was a "Kingdom Hearts" <a href="trading%20card%20game">trading card game</a> produced by <a href="Tomy">Tomy</a>. The TCG featured <a href="Starter%20pack">starter decks</a>, playing mats, and <a href="booster%20pack">booster pack</a>s. <a href="Fantasy%20Flight%20Games">Fantasy Flight Games</a> later acquired the rights to market it to English-speaking countries. In 2007, a remake for the PlayStation 2, titled "Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories" was released along with "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" in a set, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II%23Final%20Mix">Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+</a>". A <a href="manga">manga</a> series ran in <a href="Monthly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Gangan">Monthly Shōnen Gangan</a> in Japan, and was later released in the United States. It is accompanied by three novels—two set during Sora's storyline and the third during "Reverse/Rebirth", Riku's story. Like with the "Final Fantasy" games and the first "Kingdom Hearts" game, Square released an "<a href="Ultimania">Ultimania</a>" book on "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" following the release of the game. In North America, <a href="BradyGames">BradyGames</a> released a strategy guide with a comprehensive walkthrough.
"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" was remade for the PlayStation 2, titled "Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories". It was developed by Square Enix's fifth Product Development Division, based in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>, and released as the second disc of "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+" in Japan on March 29, 2007 and as a standalone title in North America on December 2, 2008. It has not been released in Europe or Australia for the PlayStation 2, but has seen a worldwide release as part of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a>". The remake includes polygonal 3D battles and worlds using the same graphics as "Kingdom Hearts", as well as voice acting and an improved soundtrack. While the card-based battle system and room synthesis aspects of the gameplay stayed mostly the same, there were additions, such as the "Reaction Command" function from "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>". Voice-acted scenes only occur in Castle Oblivion, as well as the Destiny Islands and Twilight Town simulations. The remake also includes new cutscenes and battles that were not in the original game. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked it as the 92nd best PlayStation 2 game. The staff felt that it stood out among other card-based RPGs.

Like the first "Kingdom Hearts", "Chain of Memories" was adapted into a manga by <a href="Shiro%20Amano">Shiro Amano</a>, following the same plot as the video game. It was serialized in Square's <a href="Monthly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Gangan">Monthly Shōnen Gangan</a> in Japan, then released in two volumes in Japan and later in the United States by <a href="TOKYOPOP">TOKYOPOP</a>. The first volume was released in Japan on October 22, 2005. A year later, it was released in English on October 10, 2006, followed by the second volume on February 6, 2007.

The manga series has had moderate success. The first volume was ranked 112th on <a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>'s "Top 150 best sellers" during the week of its release. IGN praised Amano's renditions of the characters and the humor added into scenes. They also commented the weak elements of the game lessened the manga's overall quality. The series was followed by a third manga series, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>". The "Chain of Memories" manga series was re-released in a boxed set in the United States on October 9, 2007.

In September 2012, Square Enix announced "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a>" a compilation for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> to include both "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20%28video%20game%29%23Final%20Mix">Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</a>" and "Re:Chain of Memories" in high definition and trophy support. Additionally, the collection includes HD cinematic scenes from "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20358/2%20Days">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</a>". It was released in Japan on March 14, 2013 and in North America on September 10, 2013. Releases on September 12, 2013 for Australia and September 13, 2013 for Europe marked the first time "Re:Chain of Memories" was available in both of those territories. This version was later ported to the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> as part of "Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix", released in March 2017.

Ceratosaurus

Ceratosaurus (from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> κέρας/κέρατος, "keras/keratos" meaning "horn" and <a href="wikt%3A%CF%83%CE%B1%E1%BF%A6%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82">σαῦρος</a>/"sauros" meaning "lizard") was a carnivorous <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> in the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a> (<a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> to <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a>). This <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">genus</a> was first described in 1884 by American paleontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> based on a nearly complete skeleton discovered in <a href="Garden%20Park%2C%20Colorado">Garden Park, Colorado</a>, in rocks belonging to the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> is "Ceratosaurus nasicornis".

The Garden Park specimen remains the most complete skeleton known from the genus, and only a handful of additional specimens have been described since. Two additional species, "Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus" and "Ceratosaurus magnicornis", have been described in 2000 from two fragmentary skeletons from the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry</a> of <a href="Utah">Utah</a> and from the vicinity of <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita, Colorado</a>. The <a href="Valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">validity</a> of these additional species has been questioned, however, and all three skeletons possibly represent different growth stages of the same species. In 1999, the discovery of the first juvenile specimen was reported. Since 2000, a partial specimen was excavated and described from the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a> of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, providing evidence for the presence of the genus outside of North America. Fragmentary remains have also been reported from <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, and <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, although their assignment to "Ceratosaurus" is currently not accepted by most <a href="paleontology">paleontologists</a>.

"Ceratosaurus" was a medium-sized theropod. The original specimen is estimated to be or long, while the specimen described as "C. dentisulcatus" was larger, at around long. "Ceratosaurus" was <a href="Phenotypic%20trait">characterized</a> by deep jaws that supported proportionally very long, blade-like teeth, a prominent, ridge-like horn on the midline of the snout, and a pair of horns over the eyes. The forelimbs were very short, but remained fully functional; the hand had four fingers. The tail was deep from top to bottom. A row of small <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s (skin bones) was present down the middle of the neck, back, and tail. Additional osteoderms were present at unknown positions on the animal's body.

"Ceratosaurus" gives its name to the <a href="Ceratosauria">Ceratosauria</a>, a <a href="clade">clade</a> of theropod dinosaurs that diverged early from the evolutionary lineage leading to modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s. Within the Ceratosauria, some paleontologists proposed it to be most closely related to "<a href="Genyodectes">Genyodectes</a>" from Argentina, which shares the strongly elongated teeth. The geologically older genus "<a href="Proceratosaurus">Proceratosaurus</a>" from <a href="England">England</a>, although originally described as a presumed antecedent of "Ceratosaurus", was later found to be unrelated. "Ceratosaurus" shared its habitat with other large theropod genera including "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", and it has been suggested that these theropods occupied different <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s to reduce competition. "Ceratosaurus" may have preyed upon plant-eating dinosaurs, although some paleontologists suggested that it hunted aquatic prey such as fish. The nasal horn was probably not used as a weapon as was originally suggested by Marsh, but more likely was used solely for display.

"Ceratosaurus" followed the <a href="body%20plan">body plan</a> typical for large theropod dinosaurs. A <a href="Bipedalism">biped</a>, it moved on powerful hind legs, while its arms were reduced in size. Specimen USNM 4735, the first discovered skeleton and <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "Ceratosaurus nasicornis", was an individual or in length according to separate sources. Whether this animal was fully grown is not clear. <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, in 1884, suggested that this specimen weighed about half as much as the contemporary "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". In more recent accounts, this was revised to , , or . Three additional skeletons discovered in the latter half of the 20th century were substantially larger. The first of these, UMNH VP 5278, was informally estimated by James Madsen to have been around long, but was later estimated at in length. Its weight was calculated at , , and in separate works. The second skeleton, MWC 1, was somewhat smaller than UMNH VP 5278 and might have been in weight. The third, yet undescribed, specimen BYUVP 12893 was claimed to be the largest yet discovered, although estimates have not been published. Another specimen (ML 352), discovered in Portugal in 2000, was estimated at in length and in weight.
The exact number of vertebrae is unknown due to several gaps in the spine of the "Ceratosaurus nasicornis" holotype. At least 20 vertebrae formed the neck and back in front of the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>. In the middle portion of the neck, the (bodies) of the vertebrae were as long as they were tall, while in the front and rear portions of the neck, the centra were shorter than their height. The upwards projecting were comparatively large, and in the dorsal (back) vertebrae, were as tall as the vertebral centra were long. The sacrum, consisting of six fused , was arched upwards, with its vertebral centra strongly reduced in height in its middle portion, as is the case in some other <a href="ceratosauria">ceratosauria</a>ns. The tail comprised around 50 and was about half of the animal's total length; in the holotype, it was estimated at . The tail was deep from top to bottom due to its high neural spines and elongated <a href="chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevrons</a>, bones located below the vertebral centra. As in other dinosaurs, it counterbalanced the body and contained the massive <a href="caudofemoralis">caudofemoralis</a> muscle, which was responsible for forward thrust during locomotion, pulling the upper thigh backwards when <a href="muscle%20contraction">contracted</a>.
The <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) was fused with the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, forming a single bone without any visible demarcation between the two original elements. The "C. nasicornis" holotype was found with an articulated left fore limb including an incomplete (hand). Although during preparation, a cast had been made of the fossil beforehand to document the original relative positions of the bones. <a href="Carpal%20bones">Carpal bones</a> were not known from any specimen, leading some authors to suggest that they were lost in the genus. In a 2016 paper, Matthew Carrano and Jonah Choiniere suggested that one or more <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> (not bony) carpals were probably present, as indicated by a gap present between the forearm bones and the metacarpals, as well as by the surface texture within this gap seen in the cast. In contrast to most more-<a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> theropods, which showed only three digits on each manus (digits I–III), "Ceratosaurus" retained four digits, with digit IV reduced in size. The first and fourth <a href="metacarpus">metacarpals</a> were short, while the second was slightly longer than the third. The metacarpus and especially the first <a href="Phalanx%20bone">phalanges</a> were proportionally very short, unlike in most other <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> theropods. Only the first phalanges of digits II, III, and IV are preserved in the holotype; the total number of phalanges and <a href="ungual">ungual</a>s (claw bones) is unknown. The anatomy of metacarpal I indicates that phalanges had originally been present on this digit, as well. The <a href="pes%20%28anatomy%29">pes</a> (foot) consisted of three weight-bearing digits, numbered II–IV. Digit I, which in theropods is usually reduced to a <a href="dewclaw">dewclaw</a> that does not touch the ground, is not preserved in the holotype. Marsh, in his original 1884 description, assumed that this digit was lost in "Ceratosaurus", but <a href="Charles%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a>, in his 1920 monograph, noted an attachment area on the second <a href="metatarsus">metatarsal</a> demonstrating the presence of this digit.

Uniquely among theropods, "Ceratosaurus" possessed small, elongated, and irregularly formed <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s (skin bones) along the midline of its body. Such osteoderms have been found above the neural spines of cervical vertebrae 4 and 5, as well as caudal vertebrae 4 to 10, and probably formed a continuous row that might have extended from the base of the skull to most of the tail. As suggested by Gilmore in 1920, their position in the rock matrix likely reflects their exact position in the living animal. The osteoderms above the tail were found separated from the neural spines by to , possibly accounting for skin and muscles present in between, while those of the neck were much closer to the neural spines. Apart from the body midline, the skin contained additional osteoderms, as indicated by a by large, roughly quadrangular plate found together with the holotype; the position of this plate on the body is unknown. Specimen UMNH VP 5278 was also found with a number of osteoderms, which have been described as amorphous in shape. Although most of these were found at most 5 m apart from the skeleton, they were not directly associated with any vertebrae, unlike in the "C. nasicornis" holotype, so their original position on the body cannot be inferred from this specimen.

The <a href="skull">skull</a> was quite large in proportion to the rest of its body. It measures in length in the "C. nasicornis" holotype, measured from the tip of the snout to the , which connects to the first cervical vertebra. The width of this skull is difficult to reconstruct, as it is heavily distorted, and Gilmore's 1920 reconstruction was later found to be too wide. The fairly complete skull of specimen MWC 1 was estimated to have been in length and in width; this skull was somewhat more elongated than that of the holotype. The back of the skull was more lightly built than in some other larger theropods due to extensive skull openings, yet the jaws were deep to support the proportionally large teeth. The <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a> formed not only the back margin of the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>, a large opening between eye and , but also part of its upper margin, unlike in members of the related <a href="Abelisauridae">Abelisauridae</a>. The <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a>, which was connected to the lower jaw at its bottom end to form the jaw joint, was inclined so that the jaw joint was displaced backwards in relation to the occipital condyle. This also led to a broadening of the base of the <a href="Infratemporal%20fenestra">lateral temporal fenestra</a>, a large opening behind the eyes.

The most distinctive feature was a prominent horn situated on the skull midline behind the bony nostrils, which was formed from fused protuberances of the left and right <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s. Only the bony horn core is known from fossils—in the living animal, this core would have supported a <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous sheath. While the base of the horn core was smooth, its upper two-thirds were wrinkled and lined with groves that would have contained <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s when alive. In the holotype, the horn core is long and wide at its base, but quickly narrows to only further up; it is in height. It is longer and lower in the skull of MWC 1. In the living animal, the horn would likely have been more elongated due to its keratinous sheath. Behind the nasal horn, the nasal bones formed an oval groove; both this groove and the nasal horn serve as <a href="autapomorphy">features to distinguish</a> "Ceratosaurus" from related genera. In addition to the large nasal horn, "Ceratosaurus" possessed smaller, semicircular, bony ridges in front of each eye, similar to those of "Allosaurus". These ridges were formed by the lacrimal bones. In juveniles, all three horns were smaller than in adults, and the two halves of the nasal horn core were not yet fused.

The <a href="premaxillary%20bone">premaxillary bone</a>s, which formed the tip of the snout, contained merely three teeth on each side, less than in most other theropods. The of the upper jaw were lined with 15 blade-like teeth on each side in the holotype. The first eight of these teeth were very long and robust, but from the ninth tooth onward they gradually decrease in size. As typical for theropods, they featured finely edges, which in the holotype contained some 10 <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> per . Specimen MWC 1 merely showed 11 to 12, and specimen UMNH VP 5278 12 teeth in each maxilla; the teeth were more robust and more recurved in the latter specimen. In all specimens, the <a href="tooth%20crown">tooth crown</a>s of the upper jaws were exceptionally long. In specimen UMNH VP 5278, they measured up to in length, which is equal to the minimum height of the lower jaw. In the holotype, they are in length, which even surpasses the minimum height of the lower jaw. In other theropods, a comparable tooth length is only known from the possibly closely related "<a href="Genyodectes">Genyodectes</a>". In contrast, several members of the Abelisauridae feature very short tooth crowns. In the holotype, each half of the , the tooth-bearing bone of the , was equipped with 15 teeth, which are, however, poorly preserved. Both specimens MWC 1 and UMNH VP 5278 show only 11 teeth in each dentary, which were, as shown by the latter specimen, slightly straighter and less sturdy than those of the upper jaw.

The first specimen, the holotype USNM 4735, was discovered and excavated by farmer Marshall Parker Felch in 1883 and 1884. Found in articulation, with the bones still connected to each other, it was nearly complete, including the skull. Significant missing parts include an unknown number of vertebrae; all but the last ribs of the trunk; the <a href="humerus">humeri</a> (upper arm bones); the distal finger bones of both hands; most of the right fore limb; most of the left hind limb; and most of the feet. The specimen was found encased in hard sandstone; the skull and spine had been heavily distorted during <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ization. The site of discovery, located in the <a href="Garden%20Park%2C%20Colorado">Garden Park</a> area north of <a href="Ca%C3%B1on%20City%2C%20Colorado">Cañon City, Colorado</a>, and known as the Felch Quarry 1, is regarded as one of the richest fossil sites of the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>. Numerous dinosaur fossils had been recovered from this quarry even before the discovery of "Ceratosaurus", most notably a nearly complete specimen of "Allosaurus" (USNM 4734) in 1883 and 1884.

After excavation, the specimen was shipped to the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven</a>, where it was studied by Marsh, who described it as the new genus and species "Ceratosaurus nasicornis" in 1884. The name "Ceratosaurus" may be translated as "horn lizard" (from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> κερας/κερατος, " keras/keratos"—"horn" and σαυρος/"sauros"—"lizard"), and "nasicornis" with "nose horn" (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "nasus"—"nose" and "cornu"—"horn"). Given the completeness of the specimen, the newly described genus was at the time the best-known theropod discovered in America. In 1898 and 1899, the specimen was transferred to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, together with many other fossils originally described by Marsh. Only part of this material was fully prepared when it arrived in Washington; subsequent preparation lasted from 1911 to the end of 1918. Packaging and shipment from New Haven to Washington caused some damage to the "Ceratosaurus" specimen. In 1920, <a href="Charles%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a> published an extensive redescription of this and the other theropod specimens received from New Haven, including the nearly complete "Allosaurus" specimen recovered from the same quarry.
In an 1892 paper, Marsh published the first skeletal reconstruction of "Ceratosaurus", which depicts the animal at in length and in height. As noted by Gilmore in 1920, the trunk was depicted much too long in this reconstruction, incorporating at least six dorsal vertebrae too many. This error was repeated in several subsequent publications, including the first life reconstruction, which was drawn in 1899 by Frank Bond under the guidance of <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a>, but not published until 1920. A more accurate life reconstruction, published in 1901, was produced by <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Gleeson">Joseph M. Gleeson</a>, again under Knight's supervision. The holotype was mounted by Gilmore in 1910 and 1911, and since then was exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History. Most early reconstructions show "Ceratosaurus" in an upright posture, with the tail dragging on the ground. Gilmore's mount of the holotype, in contrast, was ahead of its time: Inspired by the upper thigh bones, which were found angled against the lower leg, he depicted the mount as a running animal with a horizontal rather than upright posture and a tail that did not make contact with the ground. Because of the strong flattening of the fossils, Gilmore mounted the specimen not as a free-standing skeleton, but as a <a href="relief">bas-relief</a> within an artificial wall. With the bones being partly embedded in a plaque, scientific access was limited. In the course of the renovation of the museum's dinosaur exhibition between 2014 and 2019, the specimen was dismantled and freed from the encasing plaque. In the new exhibition, which is set to open in 2019, the mount is planned to be replaced by a free-standing cast, and the original bones to be stored in the museum collection to allow full access for scientists.

After the discovery of the holotype of "C. nasicornis", a significant "Ceratosaurus" find was not made until the early 1960s, when paleontologist James Madsen and his team unearthed a fragmentary, disarticulated skeleton including the skull (UMNH VP 5278) in the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. This find represents one of the largest-known "Ceratosaurus" specimens. A second, articulated specimen including the skull (MWC 1) was discovered in 1976 by Thor Erikson, the son of paleontologist Lance Erikson, near <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita, Colorado</a>. A fairly complete specimen, it lacks lower jaws, forearms and <a href="Gastralium">gastralia</a>. The skull, although reasonably complete, was found disarticulated and is strongly flattened sidewards. Although a large individual, it had not yet reached adult size, as indicated by open sutures between the skull bones. Scientifically accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of the skull for use in museum exhibits were produced using a complicated process including molding and casting of the individual original bones, correction of deformities, reconstruction of missing parts, assembly of the bone casts into their proper position, and painting to match the original color of the bones.

Both the Fruita and Cleveland-Lloyd specimens were described by Madsen and <a href="Samuel%20Paul%20Welles">Samuel Paul Welles</a> in a 2000 monograph, with the Utah specimen being assigned to the new species "C. dentisulcatus" and the Colorado specimen to the new species "C. magnicornis". The name "dentisulcatus" refers to the parallel grooves present on the inner sides of the premaxillary teeth and the first three teeth of the lower jaw in that specimen; "magnicornis" points to the larger nasal horn. The <a href="Valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">validity</a> of both species, however, was questioned in subsequent publications. Brooks Britt and colleagues, in 2000, claimed that the "C. nasicornis" holotype was in fact a juvenile individual, with the two larger species representing the adult state of a single species. Oliver Rauhut, in 2003, and Matthew Carrano and Scott Sampson, in 2008, considered the anatomical differences cited by Madsen and Welles to support these additional species to represent <a href="ontogeny">ontogenetic</a> (age-related) or individual variation.
A further specimen (BYUVP 12893) was discovered in 1992 in the Agate Basin Quarry southeast of <a href="Moore%2C%20Utah">Moore, Utah</a>, but still awaits description. The specimen, considered the largest known from the genus, includes the front half of a skull, seven fragmentary pelvic dorsal vertebrae, and an articulated pelvis and sacrum. In 1999, Britt reported the discovery of a "Ceratosaurus" skeleton belonging to a juvenile individual. Discovered in <a href="Bone%20Cabin%20Quarry">Bone Cabin Quarry</a> in Wyoming, it is 34% smaller than the "C. nasicornis" holotype and consists of a complete skull as well as 30% of the remainder of the skeleton including a complete pelvis.

Besides these five skeletal finds, fragmentary "Ceratosaurus" remains have been reported from various localities from stratigraphic zones 2 and 4-6 of the Morrison Formation, including some of the major fossil sites of the formation. <a href="Dinosaur%20National%20Monument">Dinosaur National Monument</a>, Utah, yielded an isolated right premaxilla (specimen number DNM 972); a large shoulder blade (scapulocoracoid) was reported from <a href="Como%20Bluff">Como Bluff</a> in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. Another specimen stems from the <a href="Dry%20Mesa%20Quarry">Dry Mesa Quarry</a>, Colorado, and includes a left scapulocoracoid, as well as fragments of vertebrae and limb bones. In Mygatt Moore Quarry, Colorado, the genus is known from teeth.

From 1909 to 1913, German expeditions of the <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> <a href="Museum%20f%C3%BCr%20Naturkunde">Museum für Naturkunde</a> uncovered a diverse dinosaur fauna from the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru Formation</a> in <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a>, in what is now <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. Although commonly considered the most important African dinosaur locality, large theropod dinosaurs are only known through few and very fragmentary remains. In 1920, German paleontologist <a href="Werner%20Janensch">Werner Janensch</a> assigned several dorsal vertebrae from the quarry "TL" to "Ceratosaurus", as "Ceratosaurus" sp. (of uncertain species). In 1925, Janensch named a new species of "Ceratosaurus", "C. roechlingi", based on fragmentary remains from the quarry "Mw" encompassing a quadrate bone, a fibula, fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other fragments. This specimen stems from an individual substantially larger than the "C. nasicornis" holotype.
In their 2000 monograph, Madsen and Welles confirmed the assignment of these finds to "Ceratosaurus". In addition, they ascribed several teeth to the genus, which had originally been described by Janensch as a possible species of "<a href="Allosaurus">Labrosaurus</a>", "Labrosaurus" (?) "stechowi". Other authors questioned the assignment of any of the Tendaguru finds to "Ceratosaurus", noting that none of these specimens displays features diagnostic for that genus. In 2011, Rauhut found both "C. roechlingi" and "Labrosaurus" (?) "stechowi" to be possible ceratosaurids, but found them to be not diagnostic at genus level and therefore designated them as "<a href="Nomen%20dubium">nomina dubia</a>" (doubtful names). In 1990, Timothy Rowe and <a href="Jacques%20Gauthier">Jacques Gauthier</a> mentioned yet another "Ceratosaurus" species from Tendaguru, "Ceratosaurus ingens", which purportedly was erected by Janensch in 1920 and was based on 25 isolated, very large teeth up to in length. However, Janensch assigned this species to "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>", not to "Ceratosaurus"; therefore, this name might be a simple copying error. Rauhut, in 2011, showed that "Megalosaurus ingens" was not closely related to either "Megalosaurus" or "Ceratosaurus", but possibly represents a <a href="carcharodontosaurid">carcharodontosaurid</a>, instead.

In 2000 and 2006, paleontologists led by <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Mateus">Octávio Mateus</a> described a find from the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a> in central-west <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> (ML 352) as a new specimen of "Ceratosaurus", consisting of a right <a href="femur">femur</a> (upper thigh bone), a left <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (shin bone), and several isolated teeth recovered from the cliffs of Valmitão beach, between the municipalities <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3">Lourinhã</a> and <a href="Torres%20Vedras">Torres Vedras</a>. The bones were found embedded in yellow to brown, fine-grained sandstones, which were deposited by rivers as floodplain deposits and belong to the lower levels of the Porto Novo Member, which is thought to be late <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> in age. Additional bones of this individual (SHN(JJS)-65), including a left femur, a right tibia, and a partial left <a href="fibula">fibula</a> (calf bone), were since exposed due to progressing <a href="Coastal%20erosion">cliff erosion</a>. Although initially part of a private collection, these additional elements became officially curated after the private collection was donated to the Sociedade de História Natural in Torres Vedras, and were described in detail in 2015. The specimen was ascribed to the species "Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus" by Mateus and colleagues in 2006. A 2008 review by Carrano and Sampson confirmed the assignment to "Ceratosaurus", but concluded that the assignment to any specific species is not possible at present. In 2015, Elisabete Malafaia and colleagues, who questioned the validity of "C. dentisulcatus", assigned the specimen to "Ceratosaurus" aff. "Ceratosaurus nasicornis".

Other reports include a single tooth found in <a href="Moutier">Moutier</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Originally named by Janensch in 1920 as "Labrosaurus meriani", the tooth was later assigned "Ceratosaurus" sp. (of unknown species) by Madsen and Welles. In 2008, Matías Soto and Daniel Perea described teeth from the Tacuarembó Formation in <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, including a presumed premaxillary tooth crown. This shows vertical striations on its inner side and lacks denticles on its front edge; these features are, in this combination, only known from "Ceratosaurus". The authors, however, stress that an assignment to "Ceratosaurus" is infeasible as the remains are scant, and furthermore note that the assignment of the European and African material to "Ceratosaurus" has to be viewed with caution.

In his original description of the "Ceratosaurus nasicornis" holotype and subsequent publications, Marsh noted a number of <a href="Phenotypic%20trait">characteristics</a> that were unknown in all other theropods known at the time. Two of these features, the fused pelvis and fused metatarsus, were known from modern-day birds, and according to Marsh, clearly demonstrate the close relationship between the latter and dinosaurs. To set the genus apart from "Allosaurus", "Megalosaurus", and <a href="Coelurosauria">coelurosaurs</a>, Marsh made "Ceratosaurus" the only member of both a new <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, the <a href="Ceratosauridae">Ceratosauridae</a>, and a new <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">infraorder</a>, the Ceratosauria. This was questioned in 1892 by <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>, Marsh's rival in the <a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>, who argued that distinctive features such as the nasal horn merely showed that "C. nasicornis" was a distinct species, but were insufficient to justify a distinct genus. Consequently, he assigned "C. nasicornis" to the genus "Megalosaurus", creating the new combination "Megalosaurus nasicornis".

Although "Ceratosaurus" was retained as a distinct genus in all subsequent analyses, its relationships remained controversial during the following century. Both the Ceratosauridae and Ceratosauria were not widely accepted, with only few and poorly known additional members identified. Over the years, separate authors classified "Ceratosaurus" within the <a href="Deinodontidae">Deinodontidae</a>, the <a href="Megalosauridae">Megalosauridae</a>, the <a href="Coelurosauria">Coelurosauria</a>, the <a href="Carnosauria">Carnosauria</a>, and the <a href="Deinodontoidea">Deinodontoidea</a>. In his 1920 revision, Gilmore argued that the genus was the most basal theropod known from after the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a>, so not closely related to any other contemporary theropod known at that time; it thus warrants its own family, the Ceratosauridae. It was not until the establishment of <a href="Cladistics">cladistic analysis</a> in the 1980s, however, that Marsh's original claim of the Ceratosauria as a distinct group gained ground. In 1985, the newly discovered South American genera "<a href="Abelisaurus">Abelisaurus</a>" and "<a href="Carnotaurus">Carnotaurus</a>" were found to be closely related to "Ceratosaurus". Gauthier, in 1986, recognized the <a href="Coelophysoidea">Coelophysoidea</a> to be closely related to "Ceratosaurus", although this clade falls outside of Ceratosauria in most recent analyses. Many additional members of the Ceratosauria have been recognized since.

The Ceratosauria split off early from the evolutionary line leading to modern birds, thus is considered <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> within theropods. Ceratosauria itself contains a group of derived (nonbasal) members of the families <a href="Noasauridae">Noasauridae</a> and <a href="Abelisauridae">Abelisauridae</a>, which are bracketed within the clade <a href="Abelisauroidea">Abelisauroidea</a>, as well as a number of basal members, such as "<a href="Elaphrosaurus">Elaphrosaurus</a>", "<a href="Deltadromeus">Deltadromeus</a>", and "Ceratosaurus". The position of "Ceratosaurus" within basal ceratosaurians is under debate. Some analyses considered "Ceratosaurus" as the most derived of the basal members, forming the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> of the Abelisauroidea. Oliver Rauhut, in 2004, proposed "Genyodectes" as the sister taxon of "Ceratosaurus", as both genera are characterized by exceptionally long teeth in the upper jaw. Rauhut grouped "Ceratosaurus" and "Genyodectes" within the family Ceratosauridae, which was followed by several later accounts.

Shuo Wang and colleagues, in 2017, concluded that the Noasauridae were not nested within the Abelisauroidea as was previously assumed, but instead were more basal than "Ceratosaurus". Because noasaurids had been used as a fix point to define the clades Abelisauroidea and Abelisauridae, these clades would consequently include many more taxa per definition, including "Ceratosaurus". In a subsequent 2018 study, Rafael Delcourt accepted these results, but pointed out that, as a consequence, the Abelisauroidea would need to be replaced by the older synonym Ceratosauroidea, which was hitherto rarely used. For the Abelisauridae, Delcourt proposed a new definition that excludes "Ceratosaurus", allowing for using the name its traditional sense. Wang and colleagues furthermore found that "Ceratosaurus" and "Genyodectes" form a clade with the Argentinian genus "<a href="Eoabelisaurus">Eoabelisaurus</a>". Delcourt used the name Ceratosauridae to refer to this same clade, and suggested to define the Ceratosauridae as containing all taxa that are more closely related to "Ceratosaurus" than to the abelisaurid "<a href="Carnotaurus">Carnotaurus</a>".
The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> showing the relationships of "Ceratosaurus" is based on the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analysis conducted by Diego Pol and Oliver Rauhut in 2012:

A skull from the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> of England apparently displays a nasal horn similar to that of "Ceratosaurus". In 1926, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> described this skull as "<a href="Proceratosaurus">Proceratosaurus</a>" (meaning "before "Ceratosaurus""), assuming that it was an antecedent of the Late Jurassic "Ceratosaurus". Today, "Proceratosaurus" is considered a basal member of the <a href="Tyrannosauroidea">Tyrannosauroidea</a>, a much more derived clade of theropod dinosaurs; the nasal horn therefore would have had evolved independently in both genera. Oliver Rauhut and colleagues, in 2010, grouped "Proceratosaurus" within its own family, the <a href="Proceratosauridae">Proceratosauridae</a>. These authors also noted that the nasal horn is incompletely preserved, opening the possibility that it represented the foremost portion of a more extensive head crest, as seen in some other proceratosaurids such as "<a href="Guanlong">Guanlong</a>".

Within the Morrison Formation, "Ceratosaurus" fossils are frequently found in association with those of other large theropods, including the megalosaurid "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>" and the allosaurid "Allosaurus". The Garden Park locality in Colorado contained, besides "Ceratosaurus", fossils attributed to "Allosaurus". The Dry Mesa Quarry in Colorado, as well as the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry and the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, feature, respectively, the remains of at least three large theropods: "Ceratosaurus", "Allosaurus", and "Torvosaurus". Likewise, Como Bluff and nearby localities in Wyoming contained remains of "Ceratosaurus", "Allosaurus", and at least one large megalosaurid. "Ceratosaurus" was a rare element of the theropod fauna; it is outnumbered by "Allosaurus" at an average rate of 7.5 to 1 in sites where they co-occur.

Several studies attempted to explain how these <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> species could have reduced direct competition. Donald Henderson, in 1998, argued that "Ceratosaurus" co-occurred with two separate potential species of "Allosaurus", which he denoted as "morphs": a morph with a shortened snout, a high and wide skull, and short, backwards-projecting teeth, and a morph characterized by a longer snout, lower skull, and long, vertical teeth. Generally speaking, the greater the similarity between sympatric species regarding their morphology, physiology, and behavior, the more intense competition between these species will be. Henderson came to the conclusion that the short-snouted "Allosaurus" morph occupied a different <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> from both the long-snouted morph and "Ceratosaurus": The shorter skull in this morph would have reduced bending moments occurring during biting, thus increased bite force, comparable to the condition seen in cats. "Ceratosaurus" and the other "Allosaurus" morph, though, had long-snouted skulls, which are better compared to those of dogs: The longer teeth would have been used as fangs to deliver quick, slashing bites, with the bite force concentrated at a smaller area due to the narrower skull. According to Henderson, the great similarities in skull shape between "Ceratosaurus" and the long-snouted "Allosaurus" morph indicate that these forms engaged in direct competition with each other. Therefore, "Ceratosaurus" might had been pushed out of habitats dominated by the long-snouted morph. Indeed, "Ceratosaurus" is very rare in the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, which contains the long-snouted "Allosaurus" morph, but appears to be more common in both Garden Park and the Dry Mesa Quarry, in which it co-occurs with the short-snouted morph.

Furthermore, Henderson suggested that "Ceratosaurus" could have avoided competition by preferring different prey items; the evolution of its extremely elongated teeth might have been a direct result of the competition with the long-snouted "Allosaurus" morph. Both species could also have preferred different parts of carcasses when acting as scavengers. The elongated teeth of "Ceratosaurus" could have served as visual signals facilitating the recognition of members of the same species, or for other social functions. In addition, the large size of these theropods would have tended to decrease competition, as the number of possible prey items increases with size.

Foster and Daniel Chure, in a 2006 study, concurred with Henderson that "Ceratosaurus" and "Allosaurus" generally shared the same habitats and preyed upon the same types of prey, thus likely had different feeding strategies to avoid competition. According to these researchers, this is also evidenced by different proportions of the skull, teeth, and fore limb. The distinction between the two "Allosaurus" morphs, however, was questioned by some later studies. <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a>, in a 2010 study, found that short-snouted individuals of "Allosaurus" from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry represent cases of extreme individual variation rather than a separate taxon. Furthermore, the skull of USNM 4734 from the Garden Park locality, which formed the basis for Henderson's analysis of the short-snouted morph, was later found to have been reconstructed too short.
In a 2004 study, <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert Bakker</a> and Gary Bir suggested that "Ceratosaurus" was primarily specialized in aquatic prey such as <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a>, crocodiles, and turtles. As indicated by a statistical analysis of shed teeth from 50 separate localities in and around Como Bluff, teeth of both "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids were most common in habitats in and around water sources such as wet <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s, lake margins, and swamps. "Ceratosaurus" also occasionally occurred in terrestrial localities. Allosaurids, however, were equally common in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. From these results, Bakker and Bir concluded that "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids must have predominantly hunted near and within water bodies, with "Ceratosaurus" also feeding on carcasses of larger dinosaurs on occasion. The researchers furthermore noted the long, low, and flexible body of "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids. Compared to other Morrison theropods, "Ceratosaurus" showed taller neural spines on the foremost tail vertebrae, which were vertical rather than inclined towards the back. Together with the deep chevron bones on the underside of the tail, they indicate a deep, "crocodile-like" tail possibly adapted for swimming. On the contrary, allosaurids feature a shorter, taller, and stiffer body with longer legs. They would have been adapted for rapid running in open terrain and for preying upon large <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> dinosaurs such as sauropods and stegosaurs, but as speculated by Bakker and Bir, seasonally switched to aquatic prey items when the large herbivores were absent.

In his 1986 popular book "<a href="The%20Dinosaur%20Heresies">The Dinosaur Heresies</a>", Bakker argued that the bones of the upper jaw were only loosely attached to the surrounding skull bones, allowing for some degree of movement within the skull, a condition termed <a href="cranial%20kinesis">cranial kinesis</a>. Likewise, the bones of the lower jaw would have been able to move against each other, and the quadrate bone to swing outwards, spreading the lower jaw at the jaw joint. Taken together, these features would have allowed the animal to widen its jaws in order to swallow large food items. In a 2008 study, Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer re-evaluated similar claims made for other dinosaurs, concluding that the presence of muscle-powered cranial kinesis cannot be proven for any dinosaur species, and was likely absent in most.

In 1884, Marsh considered the nasal horn of "Ceratosaurus" to be a "most powerful weapon" for both offensive and defensive purposes, and Gilmore, in 1920, concurred with this interpretation. The use of the horn as a weapon is now generally considered unlikely, however. In 1985, David Norman believed that the horn was "probably not for protection against other predators," but might instead have been used for intraspecific combat among male ceratosaurs contending for breeding rights. <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a>, in 1988, suggested a similar function, and illustrated two "Ceratosaurus" engaged in a nonlethal butting contest. In 1990, Rowe and Gauthier went further, suggesting that the nasal horn of "Ceratosaurus" was "probably used for display purposes alone" and played no role in physical confrontations. If used for display,the horn likely would have been brightly colored. A display function was also proposed for the row of osteoderms running down the body midline.

The strongly shortened metacarpals and phalanges of "Ceratosaurus" raise the question whether the manus retained the grasping function assumed for other basal theropods. Within the Ceratosauria, an even more extreme manus reduction can be observed in abelisaurids, where the fore limb <a href="Vestigiality">lost its original function</a>, and in "Limusaurus". In a 2016 paper on the anatomy of the "Ceratosaurus" manus, Carrano and Jonah Choiniere stressed the great morphological similarity of the manus with those of other basal theropods, suggesting that it still fulfilled its original grasping function, despite its shortening. Although only the first phalanges are preserved, the second phalanges would have been mobile, as indicated by the well-developed articular surfaces, and the digits would likely have allowed a similar degree of motion as in other basal theropods. As in other theropods other than abelisaurids, digit I would have been slightly turned in when <a href="Flexes">flexed</a>.

A cast of the brain cavity of the holotype was made under Marsh's supervision, probably during preparation of the skull, allowing Marsh to conclude that the brain "was of medium size, but comparatively much larger than in the herbivorous dinosaurs". The skull bones, however, had been cemented together afterwards, so the accuracy of this cast could not be verified by later studies.

A second, well preserved braincase had been found with specimen MWC 1 in Fruita, Colorado, and was <a href="CT%20scan">CT-scanned</a> by paleontologists Kent Sanders and David Smith, allowing for reconstructions of the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a>, gross regions of the brain, and <a href="Dural%20venous%20sinuses">cranial sinuses</a> transporting blood away from the brain. In 2005, the researchers concluded that "Ceratosaurus" possessed a brain cavity typical for basal theropods, and similar to that of "Allosaurus". The impressions for the <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s, which house the sense of smell, are well-preserved. While similar to those of "Allosaurus", they were smaller than in "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", which is thought to have been equipped with a very keen sense of smell. The <a href="semicircular%20canals">semicircular canals</a>, which are responsible for the <a href="sense%20of%20balance">sense of balance</a> and therefore allow for inferences on habitual head orientation and locomotion, are similar to those found in other theropods. In theropods, these structures are generally conservative, suggesting that functional requirements during locomotion have been similar across species. The foremost of the semicircular canals was enlarged, a feature generally found in bipedal animals. The orientation of the lateral semicircular canal indicates that the head and neck were held horizontally in neutral position.

The holotype of "C. nasicornis" was found with its left metatarsals II to IV fused together. Marsh, in 1884, dedicated a short article to this at the time unknown feature in dinosaurs, noting the close resemblance to the condition seen in modern birds. The presence of this feature in "Ceratosaurus" became controversial in 1890, when <a href="Georg%20Baur">Georg Baur</a> speculated that the fusion in the holotype was the result of a healed <a href="fracture">fracture</a>. This claim was repeated in 1892 by Cope, while arguing that "C. nasicornis" should be classified as a species of "Megalosaurus" due to insufficient anatomical differences between these genera. However, examples of fused metatarsals in dinosaurs that are not of pathological origin have been described since, including taxa more basal than "Ceratosaurus". Osborn, in 1920, explained that no abnormal bone growth is evident, and that the fusion is unusual, but likely not pathological. Ronald Ratkevich, in 1976, argued that this fusion had limited the running ability of the animal, but this claim was rejected by Paul in 1988, who noted that the same feature occurs in many fast-moving animals of today, including ground birds and ungulates. A 1999 analysis by Darren Tanke and Bruce Rothschild suggested that the fusion was indeed pathological, confirming the earlier claim of Baur. Other reports of pathologies include a stress fracture in a foot bone assigned to the genus, as well as a broken tooth of an unidentified species of "Ceratosaurus" that shows signs of further <a href="Tooth%20wear">wear</a> received after the break.

All North American "Ceratosaurus" finds come from the Morrison Formation, a sequence of shallow marine and <a href="Alluvium">alluvial</a> <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s in the western United States, and the most fertile source for dinosaur bones of the continent. According to <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>, the age of the formation ranges between 156.3 million <a href="year">year</a>s old (Mya) at its base, and 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late <a href="Oxfordian%20stage">Oxfordian</a>, Kimmeridgian, and early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> <a href="stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stages</a> of the Late Jurassic period. "Ceratosaurus" is known from Kimmeridgian and Tithonian strata of the formation. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semiarid</a> environment with distinct <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>s. The Morrison Basin stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the <a href="Front%20Range">Front Range</a> of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>s were carried by streams and <a href="river">river</a>s and deposited in <a href="swamp">swamp</a>y lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.
The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Other dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods "<a href="Koparion">Koparion</a>", "<a href="Stokesosaurus">Stokesosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "Allosaurus", and "Torvosaurus"; the sauropods "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>", "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>", and "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>"; and the <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", "<a href="Othnielia">Othnielia</a>", "<a href="Gargoyleosaurus">Gargoyleosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Allosaurus", which accounted for 70 to 75% of all theropod specimens, was at the top <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> of the Morrison <a href="food%20chain">food web</a>. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included <a href="actinopterygii">ray-finned fishes</a>, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s, <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s like "<a href="Dorsetochelys">Dorsetochelys</a>", <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodonts</a>, <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, terrestrial and aquatic <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorpha</a>ns such as "<a href="Hoplosuchus">Hoplosuchus</a>", and several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s such as "<a href="Harpactognathus">Harpactognathus</a>" and "<a href="Mesadactylus">Mesadactylus</a>". Shells of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s and aquatic <a href="snail">snail</a>s are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of <a href="chlorophyta">green algae</a>, <a href="Fungus">fungi</a>, <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="equisetum">horsetails</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>es, and several families of <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a>. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s and <a href="fern">fern</a>s (<a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s) to fern <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s with occasional trees such as the "<a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>"-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

A partial "Ceratosaurus" specimen indicates the presence of the genus in the Portuguese Porto Novo Member of the Lourinhã Formation. Many of the dinosaurs of the Lourinhã Formation are the same genera as those seen in the Morrison Formation, or have a close counterpart. Besides "Ceratosaurus", the researchers also noted the presence of "Allosaurus" and "Torvosaurus" in the Portuguese rocks are primarily known from the Morrison, while "<a href="Lourinhanosaurus">Lourinhanosaurus</a>" has so far only been reported from Portugal. Herbivorous dinosaurs from the Porto Novo Member include, among others, the sauropods "<a href="Dinheirosaurus">Dinheirosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Zby">Zby</a>", as well as the <a href="Stegosauria">stegosaur</a> "<a href="Miragaia%20longicollum">Miragaia</a>". During the Late Jurassic, Europe had just been separated from North America by the still narrow <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and Portugal, as part of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, was still separated from other parts of Europe. According to Mateus and colleagues, the similarity between the Portuguese and North American theropod faunas indicates the presence of a temporary <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a>, allowing for faunal interchange. Malafaia and colleagues, however, argued for a more complex scenario, as other groups, such as sauropods, turtles, and crocodiles, show clearly different species compositions in Portugal and North America. Thus, the incipient separation of these faunas could have led to interchange in some but <a href="allopatric%20speciation">allopatric speciation</a> in other groups.

Chew Valley Lake

Chew Valley Lake () is a large <a href="reservoir%20%28water%29">reservoir</a> in the <a href="Chew%20Valley">Chew Valley</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, and the fifth-largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom (the largest in south-west England), with an area of 1,200 acres (4.9 km²). The lake, created in the early 1950s and opened by <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1956, provides much of the <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> for the city of <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and surrounding area, taking its supply from the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a>. Some of the water from the lake is used to maintain the flow in the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a>.

Before the lake was created, archaeological investigations were carried out that showed evidence of occupation since <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times and included <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> artefacts. The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) and a <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA). It is a national centre for <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a>, with over 260 species recorded. The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year, and two nature trails have been created. The <a href="flora%20%28plants%29">flora</a> and <a href="fauna%20%28animals%29">fauna</a> provide <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitats</a> for some less common plants and insects.

Some restricted use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner, <a href="Bristol%20Water">Bristol Water</a>, including <a href="dinghy%20sailing">dinghy sailing</a> and fishing, primarily for <a href="trout">trout</a>.

Chew Valley Lake is in the <a href="Chew%20Valley">Chew Valley</a> at the northern edge of the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a>, surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of <a href="Chew%20Stoke">Chew Stoke</a>, <a href="Chew%20Magna">Chew Magna</a> and <a href="Bishop%20Sutton">Bishop Sutton</a>. When it was built in the 1950s, its 1,200 acres (4.9 km²) were flooded with 4,500 million imperial gallons (20,000,000 m³) of water from the Mendip hills, with a catchment area of 14,000 acres (57 km²). It is shallow, with an average depth of 14 ft (4 m) at top level and a maximum depth of just 37 ft (11 m). It is fed by small rivers, and it flows into the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a> for 17 miles (27 km) before it joins the <a href="River%20Avon%2C%20Bristol">Avon</a> to head out to sea. The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower, where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20 ft (6 m). "Denny Island", above the surface throughout the year, is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife.

The lake is owned and operated by Bristol Water, which created it in 1956 when the demand became too large for nearby <a href="Blagdon%20Lake">Blagdon Lake</a>. Working with the <a href="Avon%20Wildlife%20Trust">Avon Wildlife Trust</a>, <a href="Somerset%20Wildlife%20Trust">Somerset Wildlife Trust</a> and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.

It has two landscaped picnic areas. Facilities include a <a href="tea%20shop">tea shop</a>, with indoor and outdoor seating areas with a view of the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75 miles (1.2 km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.

Access to the waterside is restricted in places to reduce the disruption to wildlife. Paths around the lake are generally flat and, where paths are surfaced, wheelchair access is possible.

Visitors are officially invited to use public transport, but overwhelmingly arrive by private car, encouraged by the provision of parking spaces. The "Chew Valley Explorer" bus route 672/674 provides access.

In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened along the B3114 on the western part of the lake. It forms part of the <a href="Padstow">Padstow</a> to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> West Country Way, <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a> <a href="NCR%203">Route 3</a>. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by <a href="Bath%20and%20North%20East%20Somerset">Bath and North East Somerset</a> Council with the support of <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a> and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.

<a href="Bristol%20Airport">Bristol Airport</a> is approximately 10 miles (15 km) away. The nearest major road is the <a href="A368%20road">A368</a>, which runs along the southern edge of the lake and provides access from <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> and <a href="Weston%20super%20Mare">Weston super Mare</a>. The <a href="A37%20road">A37</a> and <a href="A38%20road">A38</a> are slightly further away, providing access from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.

The area the lake covers was once rich farmland. Farms and houses had to be removed before the land was flooded, and old roads, hedgerows and tree stumps can reappear when dry summers cause the level of the lake to drop. Prior to the flooding of the <a href="reservoir%20%28water%29">reservoir</a>, <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavations</a> were carried out by <a href="Philip%20Rahtz">Philip Rahtz</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Greenfield">Ernest Greenfield</a> employed by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Works%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Works</a>, from 1953 to 1955. The excavations found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as <a href="Upper%20Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic</a>, <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> and <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> (Old, Middle and New <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>), <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, including implements such as stone knives, <a href="flint">flint</a> blades and the head of a <a href="mace%20%28bludgeon%29">mace</a>, along with buildings and graves. The <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a> from this period are held at <a href="Bristol%20City%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery</a>. Further evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation is provided by the archaeological survey of the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Excavations have also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century to third century AD. The finds included a <a href="Roman%20villa">villa</a> at Chew Park where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with <a href="ink">ink</a> writing were found. The tablets were sent to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake's other historical artefacts.

Further excavations around the village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> times and possibly the remains of the <a href="Nunnery">Nunnery</a> of Santa Cruz. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four <a href="flour%20mill">flour mill</a>s powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of <a href="Blaise%20Castle">Blaise Castle</a> Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to <a href="Chew%20Stoke">Chew Stoke</a> Parish Church. There is evidence of <a href="Limekiln">lime kilns</a>, which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both <a href="arable%20land">arable</a> and <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy</a>, continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were <a href="orchard">orchard</a>s for fruit production, including apples, pears and <a href="plum">plum</a>s. Moreton was also the site of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> mill in the 18th century.

Plans for the building of the reservoir were under discussion before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by <a href="compulsory%20purchase">compulsory purchase</a>. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>. The core of the dam was made of <a href="puddling%20%28engineering%29">puddled</a> <a href="clay">clay</a> mixed with <a href="sand">sand</a>. This was the first time the gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, accompanied by <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a>, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.

During the <a href="Chew%20Stoke%20flood%20of%201968">storm of 10 July 1968</a>, the lake gained an extra 471 million imperial gallons (2,140,000 m³) and rose 19 inches (480 mm) in under 12 hours. At one point worried <a href="Bristol%20City%20Police">Bristol police</a> issued a warning that the dam might not hold, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including <a href="Pensford">Pensford</a> and <a href="Keynsham">Keynsham</a>.

The lake is designated a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) and a <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) largely because of the diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area around the lake also falls within the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a> <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB).

The lake appears to have a higher sedimentation rate than would be expected in other similar reservoirs, being in the region of 100–150 t.km.yr.

The main geological outcrops around the lake are <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>, largely consisting of red <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> from the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> deposits beside the course of the River Chew.

Over 260 species of birds have been recorded at Chew, an internationally important site for wintering and migrating wildfowl. From late July to February, up to 4,000 <a href="duck">duck</a>s (Anatidae) of twelve different species may be present, including internationally important numbers of <a href="northern%20shoveler">northern shoveler</a> ("Anas clypeata") and <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a> ("Anas strepera"). Up to 600 <a href="great%20crested%20grebe">great crested grebe</a>s ("Podiceps cristatus") gather to moult on the lake in autumn. Data on bird species and their numbers on the lake, dating back to the first "<a href="Bird%20ringing">ringing</a>" in 1964, is available from the Chew Valley Ringing Station.

Numerous other birds can be seen, especially during the spring and autumn <a href="bird%20migration">migration</a>. <a href="Sand%20martin">Sand martin</a>s ("Riparia riparia") arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or third week of March. Flocks of <a href="titmouse">tits</a> (Paridae), <a href="Hirundinidae">swallows</a> (Hirundinidae) and <a href="terns">terns</a> (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as <a href="northern%20lapwing">lapwings</a> ("Vanellus vanellus"), <a href="dunlin">dunlin</a> ("Calidris alpina") and <a href="common%20snipe">common snipe</a> ("Gallinago gallinago"), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 <a href="gull">gull</a>s, mostly <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed gull</a> ("Chroicocephalus ridibundus") and <a href="common%20gull">common gull</a> ("Larus canus"), may be roosting. Good numbers of <a href="reed%20warbler">reed warbler</a>s ("Acrocephalus scirpaceus") and <a href="sedge%20warbler">sedge warbler</a>s ("A. schoenobaenus") nest in the fringing reeds, along with <a href="grebes">grebes</a> (Podicipedidae) and <a href="Eurasian%20coot">Eurasian coot</a>s ("Fulica atra").

Much of the management work carried out in the nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of <a href="tufted%20duck">tufted duck</a> ("Aythya fuligula"), <a href="common%20pochard">common pochard</a> ("Aythya ferina"), <a href="common%20shelduck">common shelduck</a> ("Tadorna tadorna") and <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a> raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include <a href="water%20rail">water rail</a> ("Rallus aquaticus") and <a href="Cetti%27s%20warbler">Cetti's warbler</a> ("Cettia cetti").

A wetland reserve has been created at Heron's Green Pool on the opposite side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a> (Cyperaceae), <a href="Juncaceae">rushes</a> (Juncaceae) and <a href="Calamagrostis">reedgrasses</a> ("Calamagrostis") and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough <a href="grassland">grassland</a> may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.

In late summer large shoals of <a href="common%20roach">roach</a> ("Rutilus rutilus") and <a href="perch">perch</a> ("Perca fluviatilis") fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (<a href="Salmo%20trutta%20fario">"Salmo trutta" morpha "fario"</a>) and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("Oncorhynchus mykiss"). Chew Valley also holds a large population of <a href="northern%20pike">pike</a> ("Esox lucius"), and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year.

<a href="Chironomidae">Aquatic midges</a> (Chironomidae) provide the highest proportion of the fly life of the lake. The <a href="trout">trout</a> (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and <a href="Corixidae">water boatmen</a> (Corixidae), and below the surface on the <a href="caddisfly">caddisfly</a> (Trichoptera) <a href="larva">larva</a>e and <a href="pupa">pupa</a>e; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including "<a href="daphnia">daphnia</a>" and <a href="snail">snail</a>s are also found in the lake. Large populations of <a href="dragonflies">dragonflies</a>, including <a href="migrant%20hawker">migrant hawker</a> ("Aeshna mixta") and significant numbers of <a href="ruddy%20darter">ruddy darter</a> ("Sympetrum sanguineum"), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot <a href="moth">moth</a> make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot ("Archanara dissoluta"), twin-spotted wainscot ("Archanara geminipuncta") and silky wainscot ("Chilodes maritimus").

The lake is surrounded with fringing <a href="reedbed">reedbed</a>s, <a href="carr%20%28fen%29">carr woodland</a> and <a href="grassland">grassland</a>, which are managed by <a href="Bristol%20Water">Bristol Water</a>. The water conditions are <a href="eutrophic">eutrophic</a> with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising <a href="Potamogeton">fennel pondweed</a> ("Potamogeton pectinatus"), <a href="Potamogeton">lesser pondweed</a> ("Potamogeton pusillus"), <a href="Groenlandia">opposite-leaved pondweed</a> ("Groenlandia densa") and <a href="Ranunculus">water-crowfoot</a> ("Ranunculus spp."). On neutral soils around the reservoir, <a href="pepper-saxifrage">pepper-saxifrage</a> ("Silaum silaus"), <a href="saxifrage">burnet-saxifrage</a> ("Pimpinella saxifraga") and <a href="scabious">devil's-bit scabious</a> ("Succisa pratensis") occur, and on calcareous soils fairy <a href="flax">flax</a> ("Linum catharticum"), <a href="Cirsium">dwarf thistle</a> ("Cirsium acaule") and <a href="salad%20burnet">salad burnet</a> ("Sanguisorba minor" subspecies "minor") are found.

The small and medium-sized fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature <a href="oak">oak</a> ("Quercus") and <a href="ash%20tree">ash</a> ("Fraxinus excelsior") trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a> ("Pinus sylvestris") and <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a>s ("Castanea sativa"). Many <a href="elm">elm</a> ("Ulmus") trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.

Four areas of woodland containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity around the lake on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them. These forests contain <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a> ("Pinus sylvestris"), <a href="English%20oak">English oak</a> ("Quercus robur"), <a href="rowan">rowan</a> ("Sorbus aucuparia") and the <a href="silver%20birch">silver birch</a> ("Betula pendula").

The lake is used for a wide variety of leisure pursuits.

During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started restoring two artificial islands. These are intended to provide safe nesting and roosting sites for a range of wildfowl. Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads, paths and bird hides are available (for a fee) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol Water. They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.

Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, approximately 1.9 miles (3 km) long, for <a href="dinghy%20sailing">dinghy sailing</a>. The lake is divided into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.

The club can cater for fleets of over one hundred boats and it hosts large national events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: <a href="Flying%20Fifteen%20%28keelboat%29">Flying Fifteen (keelboat)</a>, <a href="Laser%20%28dinghy%29">Laser (dinghy)</a>, <a href="Solo%20%28dinghy%29">Solo (dinghy)</a> and <a href="Topper%20%28dinghy%29">Topper (dinghy)</a> as well as a handicap fleet run under the <a href="Portsmouth%20yardstick">Portsmouth yardstick</a> scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. <a href="Royal%20Yachting%20Association">Royal Yachting Association</a> sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.

Seasonal day and afternoon bank fishing permits are available at Woodford Lodge. The restrictions imposed by Bristol Water mean that no fishing is allowed from the dams or stone <a href="Dike%20%28construction%29">embankments</a>, the sailing club, in front of Stratford bird hide, in front of the <a href="picnic">picnic</a> areas and in the <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a>. There is a fleet of 32 motor boats for hire to fish.

Ambrose Rookwood

Ambrose Rookwood (c. 1578 – 31 January 1606) was a member of the failed 1605 <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>, a conspiracy to replace the <a href="Protestantism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Protestant%20influence%20on%20politics">Protestant</a> King <a href="James%20I">James I</a> with a <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales%23Tudor%20period%20and%20Catholic%20resistance">Catholic</a> sovereign. Rookwood was born into a wealthy family of Catholic <a href="recusants">recusants</a>, and educated by <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a>s in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>. His older brother became a <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>, and his two younger brothers were ordained as Catholic priests. Rookwood became a <a href="horse-breeder">horse-breeder</a>. He married the Catholic Elizabeth Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons.

He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, a religious <a href="zealot">zealot</a> whose impatience with James' treatment of English Catholics had grown so severe that he conspired to blow up the <a href="Westminster%20Palace%23The%20Old%20Palace">House of Lords</a> with gunpowder, killing the king and much of the Protestant hierarchy. With the other conspirators he had recruited, Catesby also planned to incite a rebellion in <a href="the%20Midlands">the Midlands</a>, during which James's nine-year-old daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a> would be captured, and installed as titular queen. Rookwood's stable of fine horses was essential for the uprising to succeed.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a> on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>, was discovered there and arrested. Rookwood fled the city, and informed Catesby and the others of the plan's failure. Together the remaining conspirators rode to <a href="Holbeche%20House">Holbeche House</a> in Staffordshire, where on 8 November they were attacked by the pursuing <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Worcester">Sheriff of Worcester</a> and his men. Catesby was killed, but Rookwood survived, and was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>.

Rookwood and the survivors were <a href="arraigned">arraigned</a> on 27 January 1606 in <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>. Pleading not guilty, he claimed to have loved Catesby "above any worldly man". He was convicted; his request for mercy was ignored, and he was <a href="hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a> on 31 January, in the <a href="Old%20Palace%20Yard">Old Palace Yard</a> at Westminster.

Born sometime about 1578, Ambrose Rookwood was the second of four sons born to Robert Rookwood and his second wife, Dorothy Drury, the daughter of <a href="William%20Drury%20%28died%201558%29">Sir William Drury</a> and Elizabeth Sothill. During his first marriage to Bridget Kemp, Robert had sired four sons, but all predeceased their father.

The Rookwood family had lived at <a href="Stanningfield">Stanningfield</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> for 300 years. Wealthy, and staunch Catholics, the authorities viewed them as trouble-makers. Ambrose's <a href="Papist">Papist</a> cousin Edward had spent ten years in prison for his faith, but in 1578 he entertained <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> at his home, <a href="Euston%20Hall">Euston Hall</a>. It was an expensive visit that made a serious dent in the family's finances, and which neutered their influence for years thereafter. Ambrose's parents had been imprisoned for their <a href="recusancy">recusancy</a>, and he was indicted on the same charge in February 1605. He was apparently happy to advertise his faith; in the summer of 1605 he commissioned a London cutler, John Craddock, to place a Spanish blade into a sword hilt engraved with the story of the Passion of Christ. As such weapons were generally worn in public, it was "a potentially dangerous statement of faith".

Ambrose and two of his brothers, Robert and Christopher, were educated by Jesuits at <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a>, then in Flanders. Both brothers became priests (Ambrose's elder brother, Henry, became a <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>), and his half-sisters Dorothea and Susanna became nuns. According to the Jesuit <a href="Oswald%20Tesimond">Oswald Tesimond</a>, Rookwood was "well-built and handsome, if somewhat short", which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant clothing. In author <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a>'s opinion, this affectation was somewhat inappropriate at a time when "clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than money".

In or shortly before 1599 he married Elizabeth, daughter of <a href="William%20Tyrwhitt">William Tyrwhitt</a>, of <a href="Bigby%2C%20Lincolnshire%23Kettleby">Kettleby</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Peter Frescheville, of <a href="Staveley%2C%20Derbyshire">Staveley</a> in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. The Tyrwhitts were another prominent Roman Catholic family and his wife was possibly a first cousin to his future fellow conspirator <a href="Robert%20Keyes">Robert Keyes</a>. The couple had two sons, Robert and Henry.

On his father's death in 1600, he inherited <a href="Coldham%20Hall">Coldham Hall</a>, which subsequently became a refuge for priests. The following year he joined the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>'s abortive rebellion against the government, for which he was captured and held at <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a>.

In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits <a href="Henry%20Garnet">Henry Garnet</a> and <a href="John%20Gerard%20%28Jesuit%29">John Gerard</a> on a pilgrimage to the shrine of <a href="St%20Winefride%27s%20Well">St Winefride's Well</a> in <a href="Holywell%2C%20Flintshire">Holywell</a>. Late in September, he was approached by <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a> and <a href="John%20Wright%20%28Gunpowder%20Plot%29">John Wright</a>, and invited to join what became known as the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>. English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> came to the throne, as his attitude appeared to be moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby's view, James had reneged on his promises. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the <a href="Westminster%20Palace%23The%20Old%20Palace">House of Lords</a> with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt to install James's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a>, as titular queen. To this end he had already helped enlist nine Catholics into the conspiracy, but was running out of money and needed to recruit more men. Rookwood was a <a href="horse-breeder">horse-breeder</a>, and his stable of fine mounts at <a href="Coldham%20Hall">Coldham Hall</a> was needed for the Midlands uprising. He had been asked to supply them with <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> about a year earlier, under the pretence that it was for <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Elizabethan%29">William Stanley</a>'s <a href="regiment">regiment</a> in Flanders—no longer an illegal operation due to the recent <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281604%29">Treaty of London</a>—but otherwise provided no funds for the conspiracy.

Although unverifiable, his wife's relationship to <a href="Robert%20Keyes">Robert Keyes</a> may mean that Rookwood already suspected that something was being planned. He was at first concerned for the welfare of the Catholic lords who would be present at the explosion, but his compunction was alleviated when Catesby promised him that they would be tricked out of attending Parliament that day. Any lingering doubts Rookwood had were removed by Catesby's lie that the Jesuits had given the scheme their approval. Rookwood had stayed with the Wintours at <a href="Huddington%20Court">Huddington Court</a>, and that month with the Catholic Lacons at <a href="Kinlet%20Hall">Kinlet Hall</a>, but at Cateby's behest he rented <a href="Clopton%20House">Clopton House</a> near Stratford, and moved there after <a href="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a>. He took with him several Catholic religious symbols, such as chalices, <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>es, <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s, Latin books and praying beads. These were concealed in a cellar built by the Jesuit <a href="Nicholas%20Owen%20%28martyr%29">Nicholas Owen</a>.
Toward the end of October he joined Keyes at his lodgings in London. A few days before the planned explosion he changed his mind about the sword he had ordered John Craddock to make, and had the cutler replace the grip with a gold one. The modified sword, which in total probably cost Rookwood more than £20, was delivered on 4 November.

The existence of the plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered ten days earlier to <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>, warning him to keep away from Parliament. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>, guarding a hoard of explosives. He was immediately arrested.

Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28plotter%29">Thomas Percy</a>, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting <a href="Christopher%20Wright%20%28plotter%29">Christopher Wright</a> (brother of John) to rush to <a href="Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a>, and tell what had happened. Wintour guessed that the government was looking for Percy, and told Wright to travel to Percy's lodgings and "bid him begone". While Wintour lingered, Christopher Wright and Percy left the city, followed by Keyes, and then Rookwood. A renowned horseman, Rookwood covered 30 miles in two hours on a single horse. Using various steeds he had left along the route, he passed Keyes at Highgate, and then Wright and Percy at <a href="Little%20Brickhill">Little Brickhill</a> near <a href="Dunstable">Dunstable</a>. He caught up with Catesby, who had left the previous day to prepare the uprising, and told him what had happened in London. The group, which now included Catesby, his servant <a href="Thomas%20Bates">Thomas Bates</a>, both Wright brothers, Percy and Rookwood, rode on to <a href="Dunchurch">Dunchurch</a>.

While Fawkes was being tortured, on 6 November the government began to round up anyone they thought might be involved. Rookwood's servants, still in the house their master had so hastily departed, were questioned on the same day. His belongings at Clopton—including several incriminating Catholic symbols—were also taken, and by the time the plotters had reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, Rookwood's name was among the list of suspects drawn up by the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a>. The fugitives continued on to Dunchurch, where they met the recently recruited conspirator <a href="Everard%20Digby">Everard Digby</a>, with his hunting party. The next day the group stole horses from <a href="Warwick%20Castle">Warwick Castle</a>, although with his fine cortège, Rookwood avoided the town. They then collected stored weapons from Norbrook, and continued on to <a href="Huddington">Huddington</a>. The party tried in vain to expand their number, but were shunned; no one was prepared to risk being labelled a traitor. Father Garnet, contacted at <a href="Coughton%20Court">Coughton Court</a> by Bates, wrote Catesby a letter in which he implored the group to stop their "wicked actions", before himself fleeing.

Rookwood was proclaimed a wanted man on 7 November. He went to confession and with the rest of the group took the sacrament—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. Through pouring rain they rode to <a href="Hewell%20Grange">Hewell Grange</a>, helping themselves to further arms, ammunition and money, and finally reached <a href="Holbeche%20House">Holbeche House</a>, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00 pm that night. Tired from three days of riding, they spread in front of the fire some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. A stray spark landed on the powder, and Rookwood, Catesby, <a href="John%20Grant%20%28Gunpowder%20plotter%29">John Grant</a> and another man were caught up in the resultant conflagration. Rookwood and Catesby were described as "reasonably well", but Grant was blinded.

Several of the conspirators disappeared into the night, but Rookwood, Catesby, the Wright brothers, Percy and Grant stayed on. By 11:00 am the next day the house was surrounded by 200 of the <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Worcestershire">Sheriff of Worcester</a>'s men. In the ensuing battle, Wintour was shot in the shoulder. John and Christopher Wright were killed. Catesby and Percy were reportedly both killed by a single <a href="Musket%23Ammunition">musket ball</a>. Rookwood was also shot, but survived and was quickly captured. His belongings should by right have been seized by the government, but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, and disappeared without trace. Rookwood and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. Those conspirators still at large were rounded up shortly after.

Watched in secret by the king and his family, the surviving conspirators were <a href="arraignment">arraigned</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> on 27 January 1606. Some of the prisoners hung their heads "as if their hearts were full of doggedness", while others were nonchalant. All except Digby pleaded "Not Guilty". Defending himself, Rookwood claimed that he had been enlisted into the plot through his friendship with Catesby, "whom he loved above any worldly man". He admitted that he could not expect mercy, but asked for it anyway, so as not to leave a "blemish and blot unto all ages".

His pleas were in vain. The jury convicted him, and he was sentenced to death. Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were <a href="hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a> at the western end of St Paul's churchyard. The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to <a href="wattle%20and%20daub">wattled</a> <a href="hurdle">hurdle</a>s and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. He shouted "Pray for me, pray for me!" According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, "I will, and be of good courage. Offer theyself wholly to God. I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." For the rest of the journey he kept his eyes closed, in prayer. Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their "royal progeny", but "spoil[ed] all the pottage with one filthy weed" by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. He seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his sentence.

AMX-30

The AMX-30 is a <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> designed by <a href="Ateliers%20de%20construction%20d%27Issy-les-Moulineaux">Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux</a> (AMX, then <a href="Nexter">GIAT</a>) and first delivered to the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st "Régiment de Chars de Combat" (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105 mm gun, firing a then advanced <a href="high%20explosive%20anti-tank%20warhead">high explosive anti-tank warhead</a> known as the "Obus G". The "Obus G" used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the HS-110 <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>, although the troublesome <a href="transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmission</a> adversely affected the tank's performance.

In 1979, due to issues caused by the transmission, the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine and the introduction of a new fin-stabilized <a href="kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">kinetic energy penetrator</a>. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D <a href="armored%20recovery%20vehicle">armored recovery vehicle</a>, the AMX-30R <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a> system, a bridge-layer, the <a href="Pluton%20%28missile%29">Pluton</a> <a href="tactical%20nuclear%20missile">tactical nuclear missile</a> launcher and a <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> launcher.

It was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs. The first, the <a href="ARL%2044">ARL 44</a>, was an interim tank. Its replacement, the <a href="AMX%2050">AMX 50</a>, was cancelled in the mid-1950s in favor of adopting the <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a> tank. In 1956, the French government entered a cooperative development program with <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> and <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in an effort to design a standardized tank. Although the three nations agreed to a series of specific characteristics that the new tank should have, and both France and Germany began work on distinctive prototypes with the intention of testing them and combining the best of both, the program failed as Germany decided not to adopt the new French <a href="tank%20gun">tank gun</a> and France declared that it would postpone production until 1965. As a result, both nations decided to adopt tanks based on their own prototypes. The German tank became known as the <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a>, while the French prototype became the AMX-30.

As early as 1969, the AMX-30 and variants were ordered by <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, soon followed by <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. By the end of production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to extend the life of their vehicles and to bring their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against Iraqi forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khafji">Battle of Khafji</a>. France and most other nations replaced their AMX-30s with more up-to-date equipment by the end of the 20th century.

Although the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">occupation of France</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> temporarily interrupted French development of <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>s, clandestine research allowed the French to quickly recover lost ground after its <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29%23Liberation%20of%20France">liberation</a> in mid-1944. During the occupation, the French had secretly worked on an armour program that was, in 1944, taken over by the state workshop "Atelier de Construction de Rueil" (ARL), resulting in the design and production of the <a href="ARL%2044">ARL 44</a>, which began production in 1946. The tank was powered by a <a href="Maybach">Maybach</a> HL-230 engine, and armed with a tank gun. Although the vehicle was comparable to contemporary battle tanks in firepower and engine power, it suffered from distinct disadvantages, including an antiquated track design. While 600 were planned, only 60 were ultimately produced by 1950. That year, these were issued to the French Army's 503rd Tank Regiment. Given that the ARL 44 had been considered only a stop-gap vehicle for the French Army's armoured forces since inception, work on a new tank had begun as early as March 1945.

Development of the new tank was offered to five separate manufacturers: "Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux" (AMX), "Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée" (FCM), <a href="Renault">Renault</a>, "Societe Lorraine de Dietrich" (SLD-Lorraine) and "Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie" (SOMUA). The new vehicle was based on the new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were similar to that of the <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Panther%20tank">Panther tank</a>, which had been used by the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger I</a>; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach engine, based on an earlier model, and the <a href="Torsion%20bar%20suspension">torsion bar</a> sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an <a href="oscillating%20turret">oscillating turret</a>, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a>, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a <a href="heavy%20tank">heavy tank</a> project with an even larger <a href="tank%20gun">tank gun</a>; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.

With the demise of the AMX 50 program in 1951, France temporarily officially abandoned the thought of producing a medium tank. It was expected that West Germany would soon be allowed to rearm, and the Germans had appeared to entertain the concept of equipping their forces with a host of low-cost light, but relatively powerfully armed tanks, their quantity compensating for a lack of full armament parity with the latest medium tanks. The prospect of delivering many thousands of these to the Germans induced the French to adopt the idea and plan to create light tank "Type 67" armoured divisions, for which the <a href="AMX-13">AMX-13/105</a> was specially designed. A private enterprise design aimed at fulfilling the same requirement was the somewhat larger Char Batignolles-Châtillon. A derived medium tank prototype of the latter, made in 1955, proved that it was possible to produce a tank with a first-rate gun and frontally protected with steel equivalence within a weight constraint of . This revived interest in the medium tank concept.

In 1956, the WEU defence workgroup FINBEL (named after France, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>), founded in 1953 and consisting of representatives of the various General Staffs, drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into <a href="FINABEL">FINABEL</a> (the added "A" standing for "Allemagne", "Germany" in French) and on 27 October 1956 at <a href="Colomb-B%C3%A9char">Colomb-Béchar</a> a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank. Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate, the type was called "Europa-Panzer" to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries were involved in the design process. The specifications (FINABEL 3A5) for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle. French and German engineers, during a conference in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank. This included a maximum width of , a height of and a tank gun, to be developed by the Franco-German military research institute at <a href="Saint-Louis%2C%20Haut-Rhin">Saint Louis</a>. The new tank would have an air-cooled, petrol engine, a torsion bar suspension with hydraulic shocks, a power-to-weight ratio of at least /metric ton and a road range of at least . In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus. That same year, on 28 November, the French and German ministries of defence in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately. The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> took power in France, creating the <a href="French%20Fifth%20Republic">Fifth Republic</a>: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the US and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.

The French prototypes were developed and produced by the "Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux", under the direction of General Joseph Molinié of the "Direction des Études et Fabrications d'Armements" (DEFA, the later "Direction Technique des Armements Terrestres") and AMX head engineer Heissler, The first prototype was completed in September 1960 and tested from February 1961; the second, with an improved range finder and track was tested in July 1961. These first vehicles had a very rounded turret, in a deliberate imitation of the Soviet <a href="T-54">T-54</a>, and Sofam petrol engines. Another seven, with an improved sleeker turret cast, were manufactured between 1961 and 1963. Work on the German prototypes was carried out by two teams, including Team A composed of <a href="Porsche">Porsche</a>, <a href="Maschinenbau%20Kiel">Maschinenbau Kiel</a>, Luther & Jordan and Jung-Jungenthal . Team B was made up by Ruhrstahl, <a href="Hanomag">Rheinstahl-HANOMAG</a> and <a href="Henschel%20%26amp%3B%20Son">Henschel</a>. Wood mock-ups were completed in 1959, while the first two prototypes were finished by 1961 (completed by Team A).

De Gaulle decided that France, though formally remaining a member, would no longer participate in the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Strauss">Franz Josef Strauss</a> began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German <a href="Bundesrat%20of%20Germany">Bundesrat</a> decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.

Comparative trials were nevertheless held at <a href="Mailly-le-Camp">Mailly-le-Camp</a>, <a href="Meppen%2C%20Germany">Meppen</a>, <a href="Bourges">Bourges</a> and <a href="Satory">Satory</a> between five French and five German prototypes between August and October 1963, under Italian, Dutch, Belgian and American supervision. The French type had received a separate national designation: "AMX 30". The trials indicated that the German type, on 1 October also getting its own name "Leopard", had a better mobility and acceleration. The French government decided that it could not procure a new tank until 1965, while the Germans refused to adopt the Franco-German tank gun, in lieu of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20L7">Royal Ordnance L7</a>, of which they had already ordered 1,500 in the autumn of 1962, their plan having failed for <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall</a> to produce in Germany a common type of munition of sufficient quality. Suggestions to save the project by combining the French turret with the German chassis failed. As a result, the program was cancelled and the French and Germans definitely decided to adopt their two separate tanks.

The prototypes of the AMX-30 weighed , and were compact, with a width of , comparable only to the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> <a href="Panzer%2061">Panzer 61</a>, and a height of , comparable only to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="T-54/55">T-55</a>. In contrast to the AMX 50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because it was found that it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged. Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness in the area of the skirt and turret ring. Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a spark ignition engine, named the SOFAM 12 GSds. Later, a multi-fuel diesel engine was adopted, developed by <a href="Hispano-Suiza">Hispano-Suiza</a>. The seven 1963 prototypes of the AMX-30 were later rebuilt with the new diesel engine. Two further prototypes, meant to be direct preproduction vehicles, were delivered in November 1965. Besides the diesel engines, they had changed hull and turret casts and different <a href="gun%20mantlet">gun mantlet</a>s; the latter would again be changed in the production vehicles.

The first production versions of the AMX-30, named "AMX 30B" to distinguish them from the "AMX 30A" prototypes, were completed in June 1966, manufactured with a welded and cast hull and a fully cast turret. The production version of the tank had a combat weight of . The AMX-30's survivability was based on its mobility; French engineers believed that the tank's mobility would have been compromised had they added enough steel plating to protect against modern anti-tank threats, including high explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT). As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. The turret has a maximum armour thickness of , the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against armour piercing projectiles. The Line-of-Sight armour values are: for the front of the hull; for the forward sides of the hull; for the rear sides and rear of the hull; for the hull top and bottom; for the turret front; for the turret sides; for the turret rear and for the turret top. Further protection is offered by a <a href="Weapon%20of%20mass%20destruction">nuclear, biological and chemical</a> protection suit, including a ventilation system.

One of the unique features of the AMX-30 was the "Obus à Charge Creuse de 105 mm Modèle F1" (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780 gram <a href="RDX">hexolite</a>, could penetrate up to of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to . As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an "ideal round" for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle.60 <a href="high%20explosive">high explosive</a> projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret's firepower was augmented by a <a href="Coaxial%20weapon">coaxial</a> <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M2 Browning machine gun</a>. The tank commander also made use of a anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 projectiles, 748 rounds and 2,050 bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes.

The production version of the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located in the rear of the hull. The engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to . The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on wide tracks. The tank could ford deep water obstacles without preparation, up to with minor preparation, and up to with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the "AMX 30 Gloutte" (from French "faire glouglou", "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.

During the production run, many improvements were implemented. These included gun stabilization from 1971, and from 1972 replacing the original coaxial heavy machine gun with a dual purpose <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> against light armour and helicopters, with the ability to depress to −8 degrees and elevate to 40 degrees. All French army vehicles were eventually brought to this newer standard; the designation remained "AMX 30B".

Beginning as early as 1973, only seven years after the beginning of production, the French began a research program for a future modification of the tank. The project was to result in a " AMX 30 Valorisé" ("upgraded AMX-30"). In June 1979, the French Army decided to both build new and modernize existing AMX-30s with an improved fire control system and a new transmission, and designated them AMX-30B2s. The first new production vehicles were taken into service in January 1982. Improvements to the COTAC APX M-508 fire control system included the installation of a <a href="laser%20rangefinder">laser rangefinder</a> and a low-light TV (LLTV). The main gun's lethality was improved with the introduction of a new armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). The original engine was exchanged for an improved variant, known as the HS-110.2, producing . The poor transmission was replaced with the semi-automatic <a href="http%3A//www.renk-france.fr/enc200-%25e2%2580%2593-upgrade-packages-for-amx-30-and-derivatives">SESM ENC200</a> transmission (now RENK France), with a torque converter. The suspension was improved by adopting new torsion bars and shocks, which increased the vertical deflection range of the road wheels, thereby improving the tank's off-road mobility. From 1998, the French army started to replace the engines of its remaining AMX-30 tanks and variants with 500 Renault Mack E9 750 hp engines.

In the nineties, a <a href="reactive%20armour">reactive armour</a> package, named BRENUS or <a href="Brennus%20%284th%20century%20BC%29">Brennus</a>, was developed for the AMX-30B2, but was issued only to two tank regiments, which in peacetime were combined into the "1er/ 2e Chasseurs", that were part of France's rapid reaction force; the other two regiments using the AMX-30, the "2e/5e Dragons", only had their tanks adapted for a possible relatively quick upgrade, in case of an emergency. The BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS ("Brique de Surblindage") G2 explosive reactive boxes with a total weight of , offering a protection equivalent to of steel at 60°. Recently, the AMX-30 has also been used as a testbed for several <a href="stealth%20technology">stealth technologies</a>, including air cooling of hull surfaces and the use of visual camouflage. This prototype is known as the "Démonstrateur Furtif à Chenille". Its hull and turret are fully covered by a superstructure built of angled plates made of <a href="radar%20absorbent%20material">radar absorbent material</a>.

The AMX-30 has a number of different variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the "basic AMX-30". This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a tank gun able to fire the supersonic ("Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé") <a href="anti-tank%20guided%20missile">anti-tank guided missile</a>, as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an <a href="armoured%20recovery%20vehicle">armoured recovery vehicle</a>, a bridgelayer, a <a href="self-propelled%20anti-aircraft%20weapon">self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle</a>, a <a href="tactical%20nuclear%20weapon">tactical nuclear</a> missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.

The armoured recovery vehicle, known as the AMX-30D (AMX-30 "Dépanneur-Niveleur"), was designed to recuperate or help maintain vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 the first of a pre-series of five vehicles was delivered. That same year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were ordered, and these began production in 1975. The recovery vehicle includes a winch powered by the vehicle's engine, with the ability to pull a maximum of of weight. The vehicle also has a heavy towing cable, while an auxiliary winch has another towing cable, able to tow up to when working over the front of the AMX-30D. In the latter case the vehicle must be supported by removable props, which are carried on the vehicle, and the bulldozer blade must be lowered on the ground. The crane can lift up the power pack and the turret. Instead of a turret, the AMX-30D is fitted with a superstructure, and weighs , although with the extra power pack it can weigh up to . The vehicle can protect itself with a machine gun. The driver's visibility is aided by the inclusion of three M-223 episcopes. The AMX-30D has a maximum on-road velocity of and a maximum road range of .

The AMX-30 bridgelayer, or "Poseur de pont", consists of the AMX-30's chassis with a box-like superstructure, supporting a scissor-type folding bridge. The bridge can span gaps. The bridge has a width of , but can be increased to through the use of appliqué panels. It can support weighs of up to . Bridgelayer development began as early as 1963, although it was not until June 1967 that development began on a prototype. Although a prototype designated AMX-30H was finished in 1968, it was not until 1971 that the vehicle was evaluated. At the end of the evaluations in September 1971, a pre-series of five vehicles was ordered, resulting in a new period of evaluations beginning on 16 October 1972. In 1975, the AMX-30H was declared standard in the French Army, although none of these vehicles were ever ordered.

The self-propelled anti-aircraft gun began development in 1969 to provide this type of vehicle to the French Army and for export. Although ultimately none were ordered for France, in 1975 Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version, denominated the AMX-30SA. Developed to defend against low-altitude attacks, the system included two Hispano-Suiza 831 A automatic guns, coupled to an "Oeil-noir" fire control system. This system had already been installed on the AMX-13, in lieu of a heavier chassis, using a turret designated the S 401 A. Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more stable platform for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an analogue computer, receiving information from a <a href="Doppler%20radar">Doppler radar</a>, which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.

Three missile systems were developed to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis. Recognizing the need for tactical nuclear missile mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by the production of a second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment. The missile itself weighs and is long. Using a simplified inertial guidance system and a solid propellant rocket motor, the Pluton has a maximum range of . The second missile system is the AMX-30R (<a href="Roland%20missile">Roland</a>) surface-to-air missile launching system, which began development in 1974. Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year. The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland's exploration radar has a detection range of . The third missile system, called the AMX-30SA, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 "Shahine", developed and manufactured by <a href="Thomson-CSF">Thomson-CSF</a>; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.

The <a href="GCT%20155mm">"canon automoteur de 155 GCT"</a> (for "Grande Cadence de Tir", fast rate of fire) was developed based on the AMX-30 chassis to provide tactical artillery support to units in the French Army, who refer to it as the <a href="AMX%2030%20AuF1">AuF1</a>. The howitzer was 40 <a href="Caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibers</a> long, and was <a href="Autoloader">autoloaded</a> allowing it a rate of fire of eight rounds per minute, with a maximum range of with the LU211 round. The turret enables the gun to have an elevation of up to 66 degrees, and allows it to traverse a full 360 degrees. The vehicle carries 42 rounds of ammunition, with combustible cartridge cases. The origins of the decision to design a self-propelled howitzer can be traced back to 1969, with the first prototype completed in 1972. By 1979, seven prototypes had been produced, and six pre-series vehicles, followed by the production of 110 vehicles. This order was later increased to 190.

The first prototype of an improved AMX-30 for the export market, known as the AMX-32, was unveiled in June 1979. Originally intended as an alternative for the AMX-30B2, and deliberately imitating the spaced armour concept the Germans had successfully implemented on the Leopard 1A3 and A4, the AMX-32 fielded greater armour protection to offer increased survivability against anti-tank guided missiles. A autocannon was included as the main gun's coaxial weapon, and a machine gun attached to the roof. However, no orders were ever placed.

AMX-30 production occurred at the "Atelier de Construction de Roanne" in the town of <a href="Roanne">Roanne</a>. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the "Atelier de Construction de Limoges", the full armour set by the "Ateliers et Forges de la Loire", the turret by the "Atelier de Construction de Tarbes", the cannon by the "Atelier de Construction de Bourges", the cupola and machine-gun by the "Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne" and the optics by the "Atelier de Construction de Puteaux"; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.

Originally, 300 AMX-30s were ordered by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been increased to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st "Régiment de Chars de Combat". Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential. However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted a large number of variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 Pluton tactical nuclear missile launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG). The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles, a batch of twenty GCTs, in 1994 by France.

In the late 1990s, the French Army began to accept the new <a href="Leclerc%20tank">Leclerc</a> main battle tank to replace the antiquated AMX-30. The first units to be outfitted with the new tank were the 501st and 503rd tank regiments, followed by the <a href="6th%20Cuirassier%20Regiment%20%28France%29">6th</a> and <a href="12th%20Cuirassier%20Regiment%20%28France%29">12th</a> Cuirassier Regiments.

Having in February 1964 decided to produce its own battle tank, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> at first considered licence production of AMX-30 hulls, while importing the turrets from France. Favoring heavier armour over mobility, Major-General <a href="Israel%20Tal">Israel Tal</a> discontinued negotiations with France when the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> agreed to allow licensed production of the <a href="Chieftain%20tank">Chieftain tank</a>, in 1966.

France eventually also failed to obtain orders from the remaining two FINABEL nations, Belgium and the Netherlands: the Dutch did not even test the type and the Belgians ordered the Leopard when France refused to allow partial component production of the AMX-30 in Belgium, fearing it would increase the unit cost.

Less expensive and easier to maintain, the AMX-30 has been preferred over the Leopard 1 by less affluent or developed nations.

In 1969, the <a href="Greek%20military%20junta">Greek military junta</a> agreed to procure a total of 190 AMX-30s and 14 AMX-30Ds, making Greece the first foreign nation to purchase the French tank. Throughout the 1960s, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> had considered both the AMX-30 and the <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> to complement their existing fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks. Ultimately, Spain opted for the AMX-30 for a variety of reasons, including British unwillingness to sell the L7 tank gun to a fascist regime and the French offer to allow the AMX-30 to be manufactured in Spain. Spain ordered 19 tanks in 1970, and later agreed to manufacture another 180 tanks in Spain. In 1979, Spain began the production of a second batch of 100 tanks, completing a total of 299 AMX-30s issued to the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Army</a>; these were designated <a href="AMX-30E">AMX-30E</a>s. Spain also procured 10 AMX-30Ds and 18 AMX-30Rs. As production of the AMX-30E ended in 1979, the Spanish Army was already looking for a modernization program to improve the quality of the tank's mobility. In 1987, the Spanish Army began a six-year modernization program which brought 150 tanks up to AMX-30EM2 standards and modified another 149 tanks to AMX-30EM1 standards. The former was a much more complete upgrade, which saw improvements to the tank's mobility through the adoption of a new engine and gearbox, as well as to the tank's firepower, with the development of a new kinetic energy penetrator and the introduction of a far more complex and accurate fire control system for the tank's gunner, amongst other things. The AMX-30EM1 was termed a "reconstruction" and only saw improvements to the tank's mobility by adopting a new transmission and renovating much of the vehicle's worn out systems, such as the brakes, indicators and controls. These rebuilt AMX-30s were soon replaced by M60 Patton tanks procured from the United States in the early 1990s, while its fleet of AMX-30EM2s was later replaced by the <a href="B1%20Centauro">B1 Centauro</a> anti-tank vehicle.

In 1972, France was able to gain a contract with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 190 AMX-30S', designed for the desert environment of the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>ern nation. Named the Palmier Contract, Saudi Arabia's tanks were delivered between 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were exported between 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps between 1977 and 1979, and finally 51 self-propelled howitzers, delivered between 1979 and 1980. Between 1979 and 1981, Saudi Arabia also received 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 "Shanine-2"s delivered in two batches, between 1980 and 1989. By the 21st century, 50% of Saudi Arabia's AMX-30 fleet were in storage, given that the AMX-30 lacked the capabilities to deal with more modern threats, such as against <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i <a href="T-62">T-62</a>s and <a href="T-72">T-72</a>s, and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i <a href="Merkava">Merkava</a> tanks. These were largely displaced by an order for 315 <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1A2</a> Abrams tanks in 1989, and the acquisition of 450 <a href="M60%20Patton">M60A3</a> Patton tanks. Although Saudi Arabia planned to procure more M1 tanks, it was unable to do so for financial reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been retired.

<a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> originally placed an order for 142 tanks in 1972, although this was later reduced to 82 and four AMX-30Ds. In the mid-1980s, Venezuela adopted a modernization plan for its deprecated AMX-30s, opting to replace the original engine with a new Continental AVDS-1790-5A diesel engine, producing and exchanging the existing transmission with an Allison CD-850-6A. Venezuelan AMX-30s received new fuel tanks, increasing the tank's road range to , while firepower was improved through the adoption of a modern Lansadot MkI fire control system and Ballistic computer from Elbit Systems. In 1977, France and Qatar signed an agreement which garnered France another 24 AMX-30s sold, which would rise to 54 when Qatar ordered a further 30 AMX-30B2s in 1987. The <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> placed an order in 1977 for 64 tanks and a single armoured recovery vehicle, to complete an armoured brigade, in 1977. Due to political issues between Chile and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the former placed an order for 46 tanks, although this was later cut short to 21 when the contract was canceled by the French government in 1981. In 1982, Cyprus acquired a total of 16 AMX-30B2s and a single AMX-30D, and later ordered another 36 AMX-30B2s. Total production of the AMX-30 and variants totaled 3,571 units.

Later many used vehicles were resold to other nations: in 2005 Cyprus had 102 AMX-30s (obtained from Greece) and 52 AMX-30B2s; <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> 32 AMX-30s (from the UAE). French strength had dwindled to about 250 AMX-30B2s.

Qatari AMX-30s saw combat during the Gulf War at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khafji">Battle of Khafji</a>, where on 30 January 1991 they counter-attacked in an attempt to retake the city of <a href="Khafji">Khafji</a> from Iraqi forces which had occupied it the night before. During the action, Qatari AMX-30s knocked out three Iraqi T-55s and captured four more. At least one Qatari AMX-30 was lost during the battle.

The French participation in the Gulf War, codenamed "<a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Daguet">Opération Daguet</a>", saw the deployment of the "<a href="6th%20Light%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28France%29">6e Division Légère Blindée</a>" ("6th Light Armoured Division"), referred to for the duration of the conflict as the "<a href="Division%20Daguet">Division Daguet</a>". Most of its armoured component was provided by the <a href="AMX-10RC">AMX-10RC</a>s of the cavalry reconnaissance regiments, but a heavy armoured unit, the "4e Régiment de Dragons" ("4th Dragoon Regiment") was also sent to the region with a complement of 44 AMX-30B2s. Experimentally, a new regimental organisational structure was used, with three squadrons of thirteen tanks, a command tank and six reserve vehicles, instead of the then normal strength of 52 units. Also six older AMX-30Bs were deployed, fitted with Soviet <a href="mine%20roller">mine roller</a>s provided by Germany from East German stocks, and named "AMX 30 Demin". The vehicles were all manned by professional crews, without conscripts. The Daguet Division was positioned to the West of the Coalition forces, to protect the left flank of the U.S. <a href="XVIII%20Airborne%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XVIII Airborne Corps</a>. This disposition gave the French commander greater autonomy, and also lessened the likelihood of encountering Iraqi T-72s, which were superior both to the AMX-10RCs and the AMX-30B2s. With the beginning of the ground offensive of 24 February 1991, French forces moved to attack its first target, "Objective Rochambeau", which was defended by a brigade from the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division. A raid by <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale%20Gazelle">Gazelle helicopters</a> paved the way for an attack by the "4e Régiment de Dragons". Demoralized by heavy coalition bombardments, the Iraqi defenders rapidly surrendered. The following day, the "4e Dragons" moved on to their next objective, "Chambord", where they reported destroying ten tanks, three BMPs, fifteen trucks and five <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> with the assistance of <a href="USAF">USAF</a> <a href="A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10s</a>, and capturing numerous prisoners. The final objective was the As-Salman air base ("Objective White"), that was reported captured by 18:15, after a multi-pronged attack, with the "4e Dragons" attacking from the south. In all, the AMX-30s fired 270 main gun rounds.

Operation Ten-Go

In April 1945, the (the largest battleship in the world), along with nine other Japanese warships, embarked from Japan on a deliberate suicide attack upon <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a> engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>. The Japanese force was attacked, stopped, and almost destroyed by <a href="United%20States">United States</a> <a href="Aircraft%20carrier">carrier</a>-borne aircraft before reaching <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. "Yamato" and five other Japanese warships were sunk.

The battle demonstrated U.S. <a href="air%20supremacy">air supremacy</a> in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific theater</a> by this stage in the war and the vulnerability of <a href="surface%20combatant">surface ship</a>s without air cover to aerial attack. The battle also exhibited Japan's willingness to sacrifice entire ships, even the pride of its fleet, in desperate "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" attacks aimed at slowing the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">Allied advance on</a> the <a href="Japanese%20Archipelago">Japanese home islands</a>.

By early 1945, following the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20campaign">Solomon Islands campaign</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, the once-formidable <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>'s Combined Fleet was reduced to just a handful of operational warships and a few remaining aircraft and aircrew. Most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan, with most of the large ships at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure, Hiroshima</a>.

As a final step before the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">planned invasion of the Japanese home islands</a>, Allied forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invaded Okinawa</a> on 1 April 1945. In March, in briefing <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the Japanese Imperial Army was planning extensive air attacks, including the use of "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>". The emperor then reportedly asked, "But what about the Navy? What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?" Now feeling pressured by the emperor to also mount some kind of attack, Japan's Navy commanders conceived a "kamikaze"-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship "Yamato".

The resulting plan—drafted under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral <a href="Toyoda%20Soemu">Toyoda Soemu</a>—called for "Yamato" and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. "Yamato" and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between <a href="Higashi%2C%20Okinawa">Higashi</a> and <a href="Yomitan%2C%20Okinawa">Yomitan</a> and fight as <a href="shore%20battery">shore batteries</a> until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for <a href="Tokuyama%2C%20Yamaguchi">Tokuyama, Yamaguchi</a>, off <a href="Mitajiri">Mitajiri</a>, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral <a href="Seiichi%20It%C5%8D">Seiichi Itō</a>—commander of the "Ten-Go" force—still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.

Other commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy also had very negative feelings about the operation, believing that it was a waste of human life and fuel. Captain Atsushi Ōi—who commanded escort fleets—was critical as fuel and resources were diverted from his operation. As he was told that the aim of this operation was "the tradition and the glory of Navy," he shouted:

This war is of our nation and why should the honor of our "surface fleet" be more respected? Who cares about their glory? Damn fools!
Vice Admiral <a href="Ry%C5%ABnosuke%20Kusaka">Ryūnosuke Kusaka</a> flew from Tokyo on 5 April to Tokuyama in a final attempt to convince the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it for the same reasons that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.

Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and accepted the proposed plan. The ships' crews were briefed on the nature of the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind if desired — none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm, were ordered off the ships, including sixty-seven naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships' crews now engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing <a href="damage%20control">damage-control</a> procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave "Yamato" and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. In a ceremonial farewell, officers and enlisted men drank sake together.

At 16:00 on 6 April, "Yamato", with Admiral Itō on board, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and eight <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s departed Tokuyama to begin the mission. Two American <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s— and —sighted the Japanese force as it proceeded south through <a href="Bungo%20Suid%C5%8D">Bungo Suidō</a>. Although they were unable to attack (due to the ships' speed), they did spend several hours shadowing the Japanese <a href="sortie">sortie</a> and sending updates of its course to the U.S. fleet. The submarines' messages, which were reportedly sent uncoded, were also picked up by radio operators on the Japanese ships.

At dawn on 7 April, the Japanese force passed the <a href="%C5%8Csumi%20Peninsula">Ōsumi Peninsula</a> into the open ocean heading south from <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a> toward Okinawa. They shifted into a defensive <a href="formation%20%28military%29">formation</a>, with "Yahagi" leading "Yamato" and the eight destroyers deployed in a ring around the two larger ships, with each ship from each other and proceeding at . One of the Japanese destroyers——developed engine trouble and turned back. U.S. <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> aircraft began to <a href="surveillance">shadow</a> the main force of ships. At 10:00, the Japanese force turned west to make it look like they were <a href="withdrawal%20%28military%29">withdrawing</a>, but at 11:30, after being detected by two American <a href="Martin%20PBM%20Mariner">PBM Mariner</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s, the "Yamato" fired a salvo with her bow guns using special but could not prevent the two planes from shadowing the Japanese force, they turned back towards Okinawa.

Upon receiving contact reports early on 7 April, <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">U.S. 5th Fleet</a> commander Admiral <a href="Raymond%20Spruance">Raymond Spruance</a> ordered Task Force 54, which consisted mostly of modernized <a href="Standard-type%20battleship">Standard-type battleship</a>s under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Morton%20Deyo">Morton Deyo</a> (which were engaged in shore bombardment), to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie. Deyo moved to execute his orders, but Vice Admiral <a href="Marc%20A.%20Mitscher">Marc A. Mitscher</a>, who commanded <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a> (TF 58), preempted Spruance and Deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers, without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed. As a senior naval aviation officer, "Mitscher had spent a career fighting the battleship admirals who had steered the navy’s thinking for most of the current century. One of those was his immediate superior, Raymond Spruance. Mitscher felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry. Though the carriers had mostly fought the great battles of the Pacific, whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt. Here was an opportunity to end the debate forever".

Around 10:00 on 7 April, Task Groups 58.1 and 58.3 (TG 58.1 and 58.3) began launching almost 400 aircraft in several waves from eight carriers (TG 58.1: , , , ; TG 58.3 , , and ) that were located just east of Okinawa. The aircraft consisted of <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">F6F Hellcat</a> and <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a>s, <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">SB2C Helldiver</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s, and <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">TBF Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. After being informed of Mitscher's launches, Spruance agreed that the airstrikes could go ahead as planned. As a contingency, Spruance ordered Admiral Deyo to assemble a force of six battleships (, , , , , and ), together with seven cruisers (including the large cruisers and ) and 21 destroyers, and to prepare for a surface engagement with "Yamato" should the airstrikes prove unsuccessful.

Around 12:00, the first American aircraft arrived over "Yamato"; these were <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">F6F Hellcat</a> and <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> fighters, which were under orders to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear to defend the ships below. None did.

Since it soon became obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. aircraft were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the "Yamato" group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, Yamato opened fire with her 460 mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. "Yamato" carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460 mm guns.

The American F6F Hellcat fighters "were supposed to go first, strafing, rocketing, dropping light ordnance, distracting the enemy gunners while the SB2C Helldivers plunged almost straight down with their heavy bombs". This was because the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers "needed all the distraction and diversion they could get when they made their dangerous low altitude runs straight at the enemy ships". The Avengers mainly attacked from the <a href="Port%20%28nautical%29">port</a> side so that if the torpedoes hit that side, it would increase the likelihood of the target ship <a href="Capsize">capsizing</a>.

At 12:46, a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> hit "Yahagi" directly in her engine room, killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop. "Yahagi" was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks. The Japanese destroyer attempted to come to "Yahagi"s aid but was attacked and heavily damaged, and sank sometime later. "Yahagi" capsized and sank at 14:05.

During the first attack wave, despite evasive maneuvers that caused most of the bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss, "Yamato" was hit by two <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing</a> bombs and one torpedo. Her speed was not affected, but one of the bombs started a fire <a href="aft">aft</a> of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> that was not extinguished. Also, during the first attack wave, Japanese destroyers and were heavily damaged and taken out of the battle. "Hamakaze" sank later.

Between 13:20 and 14:15, the second and third waves of U.S. aircraft attacked, concentrating on "Yamato". During this time, "Yamato" was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs. The bombs did extensive damage to the topside of the ship, including knocking out power to the <a href="Director%20%28military%29">gun director</a>s and forcing the anti-aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired, greatly reducing their effectiveness. The torpedo hits—almost all on the port side—caused "Yamato" to list enough that capsizing was now an imminent danger. The water damage-control station had been destroyed by a bomb hit making it impossible to counter-flood the specially designed spaces within the ship's <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> to counteract hull damage. At 13:33, in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from capsizing, "Yamato"s damage control team counter-flooded both <a href="starboard">starboard</a> engine and <a href="boiler">boiler</a> rooms. This mitigated the danger but also <a href="Drowning">drowned</a> the several hundred crewmen manning those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water. The loss of the starboard engines—plus the weight of the water—caused "Yamato" to slow to about . At that same moment, the Americans launched another 110 aircraft from Task Group 58. Twenty Avengers made a new torpedo run from 60 degrees to port. Yamato started a sharp turn to port but three torpedoes ripped into her port side amidships, jamming her auxiliary rudder in position hard port.

With "Yamato" proceeding more slowly and therefore easier to target, U.S. torpedo aircraft concentrated on hitting her rudder and stern with torpedoes in order to affect her steering ability, which they succeeded in doing. At 14:02, after being informed that the ship could no longer steer and was unavoidably sinking, Admiral Itō ordered the mission canceled, the crew to abandon ship, and for the remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors. "Yamato" communicated this message to the other surviving ships by <a href="signal%20flag">signal flag</a> because her <a href="radio">radio</a>s had been destroyed.
At 14:05, "Yamato" was stopped dead in the water and began to capsize. Admiral Itō and Captain Aruga <a href="The%20captain%20goes%20down%20with%20the%20ship">refused to abandon her</a> with the rest of the survivors. At 14:20, "Yamato" capsized completely and began to sink (). At 14:23, she suddenly blew up with an <a href="explosion">explosion</a> so large that it was reportedly heard and seen away in <a href="Kagoshima">Kagoshima</a> and sent up a <a href="Mushroom%20cloud">mushroom-shaped cloud</a> almost into the air. Japanese survivor Yoshida Mitsuru said that her large explosion downed several U.S. planes observing her end. The explosion is believed to have occurred when the fires ignited by bomb hits reached the main <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>.

Attempting to make it back to port, Japanese destroyer was bombed and sunk with all hands by U.S. aircraft. The Japanese destroyer was also crippled by U.S. carrier aircraft attack during the battle and had to be scuttled by other, relatively undamaged Japanese destroyers. "Suzutsuki"—despite her <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> being blown off—was able to make it to <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a>, Japan, by steaming in reverse the entire way.

The remaining three less-damaged Japanese destroyers (, , and ) were able to rescue 280 survivors from "Yamato" (sources differ on the size of "Yamato"s crew, giving it as between 2,750 and 3,300 men), plus 555 survivors from "Yahagi" (out of a crew of 1,000) and just over 800 survivors from "Isokaze", "Hamakaze", and "Kasumi". Between 3,700 and 4,250 Japanese naval personnel perished in the battle. The ships took the survivors to Sasebo.
A total of 10 U.S. aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers during the time that the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.

During the battle, the Japanese Army conducted an air attack on the U.S. naval fleet at Okinawa as promised, but they failed to sink any ships. Around 115 aircraft—many of them "kamikaze"—attacked the U.S. ships throughout the day of 7 April. "Kamikaze" aircraft hit the aircraft carrier "Hancock", battleship , and destroyer , causing moderate damage to "Hancock" and "Maryland" and heavy damage to "Bennett". About 100 of the Japanese aircraft were lost in the attack.

"Ten-Go" was the last major Japanese naval operation of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations for the rest of the conflict. "Suzutsuki" was never repaired. "Fuyutsuki" was repaired but hit a U.S. air-dropped mine at <a href="Moji-ku%2C%20Kitaky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Moji</a>, Japan, on 20 August 1945, and was not subsequently repaired. "Yukikaze" survived the war almost undamaged. "Hatsushimo" hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945, near <a href="Maizuru%2C%20Kyoto">Maizuru</a>, Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war.

"Maryland" was kept out of the war following the "kamikaze" attacks.

Okinawa was declared secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945, after an intense and costly battle. <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan surrendered</a> in August 1945, after being <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">bombed twice with atomic weapons</a>. The apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice so many of its people using suicidal tactics such as Operation "Ten-Go" and in the Battle of Okinawa reportedly was a factor in the American decision to employ atomic weapons against Japan.

The story of Operation "Ten-Go" is revered to some degree in modern Japan as evidenced by appearances of the story in popular <a href="Culture%20of%20Japan">Japanese culture</a> which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One of the reasons the event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word "Yamato" was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship "Yamato" could serve as a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.

Tanque Argentino Mediano

The Tanque Argentino Mediano (TAM; <a href="English%20language">English</a>: "Argentine Medium Tank") is a <a href="medium%20tank">medium tank</a> in service with the <a href="Argentine%20Army">Argentine Army</a>. Lacking the experience and resources to design a tank, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Argentina%29">Argentine Ministry of Defense</a> contracted German company <a href="Thyssen-Henschel">Thyssen-Henschel</a>. The vehicle was developed by a German and <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> team of engineers, and was based on the German <a href="Marder%20%28IFV%29">Marder infantry fighting vehicle</a>.

The TAM met the Argentine Army's requirement for a modern, lightweight and fast tank with a low silhouette and sufficient firepower to defeat contemporary armored threats. Development began in 1974 and resulted in the construction of three prototypes by early 1977 and full-scale production by 1979. Assembly took place at the local TAMSE plant, founded for the purpose by the Argentine government. Economic difficulties halted production in 1983, but manufacturing began anew in 1994 until the army's order of 200 tanks was fulfilled.

The TAM series includes seven different variants, such as a <a href="self-propelled%20howitzer">self-propelled howitzer</a> and a self-propelled mortar vehicle. In total, over 280 such vehicles were built, including armored personnel carriers, artillery and mortar pieces. The TAM and VCTP (Infantry Fighting Vehicles based on the TAM chassis) were manufactured for the <a href="Peruvian%20Army">Peruvian Army</a>, only to be integrated into the Argentine Army when Peru canceled the contract. The TAM also competed for other export orders, but the TAM was ultimately not exported.

The TAM has never seen combat, although 17 VCTPs were deployed to <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> for the United Nations <a href="UNPROFOR">UNPROFOR</a> peacekeeping mission.

During the 1960s Argentina sought to replace its aging fleet of tanks, which included <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Sherman%20Firefly">Sherman V Firefly tanks</a> and American <a href="M3%20Half-track">M3A1 half-tracks</a> dating from shortly after the Second World War. In their attempts to procure equipment from the United States, Argentina could only secure 50 <a href="M41%20Walker%20Bulldog">M41 Walker Bulldog</a>s (undelivered) and 250 <a href="M113%20Armored%20Personnel%20Carrier">M113 armored personnel carriers</a>. When the United States turned down requests for further equipment, the Argentine government turned to the other side of the Atlantic, putting their "Plan Europa" (Plan Europe) into action. It was hoped that European technology could stimulate Argentine industry so the country could produce its own armaments in the future. Argentina procured 80 <a href="AMX-13">AMX-13</a> light tanks, as well as 180 <a href="AMX-VCI">AMX-VCI</a>s and 24 <a href="Mk%20F3%20155mm">AMX-155 F3s</a>, from the French government, manufacturing around 40 AMX-13s and 60 AMX-VCIs at home. The French <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a> and German <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> were also examined as possible replacements for the Argentine Sherman fleet.

In 1973 the Argentine Ministry of Defense drew up a series of requirements for a tank to enter service in the 1980s. The armored vehicle would weigh no more than , move at a maximum speed of , and cover at least on roads. It would be armed with a modern 105 mm main gun, two <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, and grenade launchers. The tank designers also had to take into account Argentina's existing infrastructure, including railroad capacity, bridges and road capacity, as well as the country's varied terrain. In late 1973 the "Proyecto de Tanque Argentino Mediano" (Argentine Medium Tank Project) was founded with the goal of designing and developing a tank for the Argentine Army. Lacking the experience and the necessary technology, the Argentine government sought collaboration with a foreign company, resulting in a contract with the German company Thyssen-Henschel. The contract called for a transfer of technology resulting in a program to develop a tank in line with the government's requirements and under a technical team that included both German and Argentine engineers. The hull of the German Marder armored personnel carrier was used, and the chassis was strengthened to support the increased weight of the TAM. Two prototypes were manufactured in late 1976 and early 1977, which were put through extensive testing for two years and over a road range of . Simultaneously, another prototype was manufactured to further the investigation of the new vehicle and complete the three prototypes as agreed in the contract.

The new tank's firepower requirements were met by fitting a British <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20L7">Royal Ordnance L7A1</a> main gun. This gun was later replaced by the modified L7A2 and finally by <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall</a>'s Rh-105-30 gun. This gun is manufactured in Argentina as the FM K.4 "Modelo" 1L. The Rh-105-30's advantages include low weight, compact size and increased lethality. Unlike the Rh-105-30, the FM K.4 does not have a <a href="muzzle%20brake">muzzle brake</a>. The locally built cannon can be elevated to 18 degrees or depressed to -7 degrees on the TAM. The gun's hydraulic recoil mechanism has an extended length of to absorb the recoil force. It is designed to fire the M735A1 <a href="Kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot</a>, which can penetrate a maximum of at . It can also fire <a href="High-explosive%20anti-tank%20warhead">high-explosive anti-tank</a> rounds, <a href="high-explosive%20squash%20head">high-explosive squash head</a> and smoke rounds. The tank's secondary armaments include a <a href="coaxial%20weapon">co-axial</a> <a href="FN%20MAG">FN MAG</a> 60-40 <a href="general%20purpose%20machine%20gun">general purpose machine gun</a> and a second FN MAG 60-20 mounted on the TAM's turret roof as an anti-aircraft machine gun. The <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a> includes a with a range of and a FLER-HG ballistic computer to compute the gun's fire solutions—helping the gunner aim and hit the target. The tank commander uses a <a href="Carl%20Zeiss%20AG">Zeiss</a> PERI-R/TA panoramic <a href="periscope">periscope</a>, with a 2x and 8x <a href="Zoom%20lens">zoom</a>.
The TAM's engine requirements included low weight and volume, but with a fast rate of acceleration and high reliability. The program chose <a href="MTU%20Friedrichshafen">MTU</a>'s MB-833 Ka 500 diesel engine, producing at 2,400 <a href="Revolutions%20per%20minute">rpm</a>. This gives the TAM a power-to-weight ratio of 24 horsepower per tonne and a maximum speed of on road and off-road. With a internal fuel tank, the TAM can travel . Its range is extended to if the vehicle is equipped with two external fuel tanks. The TAM's transmission is a <a href="Renk">Renk</a> HSWL-204 automatic, with a <a href="torque%20converter">hydrodynamic torque converter</a>. A double brake system includes hydraulic disk brakes on the roadwheels, and the suspension is a <a href="Torsion%20beam%20suspension">torsion bar</a>.

The TAM's survivability is related to its low profile turret, based on that of the Leopard 1A4s and the <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a>, and its physical armor array. It has at 75 degrees on the <a href="glacis">glacis</a> plate and 32 degrees on the vehicle's sides. This offers protection against anti-armor shells from up to guns. The turret front is protected by of steel armor at an angle of 32 degrees. Although the tank's weight and armor protection are light compared to other main battle tanks, it has the advantage of better tactical mobility over the nation's terrain.

As a private venture, Thyssen-Henschel built a fourth prototype designated TH 301. Completed in 1978, it added a PERI R12 periscope, originally designed for the <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a>A4, for the tank commander. The gunner and loader each received a day periscope as well. To enable the crew to fire effectively at night, a <a href="low%20light%20level%20television">low light level television</a> (LLLTV) camera, which moved in elevation with the main gun, was fitted to the <a href="Gun%20mantlet">mantlet</a>. Furthermore, the tank received a more powerful engine. The improvement program also made provisions to increase the thickness of the armor for additional protection.

In 2010, a modernization program was announced. Israeli defense contractor <a href="Elbit%20Systems">Elbit Systems</a> was chosen to provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization, and most probably the <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20L7">L7A2 105 mm cannon</a> will be replaced with a more powerful 120 mm cannon, like the <a href="Rheinmetall%20120%20mm%20gun">L44 120 mm Cannon</a>. The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013.

A number of variants were built on the same chassis as the TAM tank. The original program called for the design of an <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>, and in 1977 the program finished manufacturing the prototype of the "Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Personal" (Personnel Transport Combat Vehicle), or VCTP. The VCTP is able to transport a squad of 12 men, including the squad leader and nine riflemen. The squad leader is situated in the turret of the vehicle; one rifleman sits behind him and another six are seated in the chassis, the eighth manning the hull machine gun and the ninth situated in the turret with the gunner. All personnel can fire their weapons from inside the vehicle, and the VCTP's turret is armed with Rheinmetall's Rh-202 <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>. The VCTP holds 880 rounds for the autocannon, including subcaliber armor-piercing DM63 rounds. It is also armed with a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> mounted on the turret roof. Infantry can dismount through a door on the rear of the hull. The commander has a day sight and seven observation periscopes, while the gunner has a day sight and three observation periscopes.
Variants also include the "Vehículo de Combate de Artillería de 155 mm" (155 mm Artillery Combat Vehicle), or VCA 155, and the "Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Mortero" (Mortar Transport Combat Vehicle), or VCTM. The VCA-155 is an elongated TAM chassis fitted with <a href="Oto%20Melara">Oto Melara</a>'s <a href="Palmaria%20%28artillery%29">Palmaria</a> <a href="self-propelled%20howitzer">self-propelled howitzer</a> <a href="Gun%20turret">turret</a>. It carries 28 projectiles, 23 of which are stored in the turret bustle. The VCTM carries an AM-50 internal mortar, which has a range of and a rate of fire of 8 to 12 shots per minute. Based on the TAM chassis, the "Vehículo de Combate Puesto de Mando" (command combat vehicle), or VCPC, is another variant designed in 1982. The "Vehículo de Combate Lanzacohetes" (Rocket launcher combat vehicle), or VCLC, designed in 1986, is also based on the TAM chassis and can be fitted with both and rockets. A combat ambulance, "Vehículo de Combate Ambulancia" (VCA), and an <a href="armored%20recovery%20vehicle">armored recovery vehicle</a>, "Vehículo de Combate de Recuperación" (VCRT) are other combat variants of the tank.

Production began in 1979, with the intent to build a total of 512 armored vehicles (200 tanks and 312 VCTP infantry fighting vehicles). Economic problems, however, ended production in 1983 with only 150 TAMs and 100 VCTPs built. These vehicles were produced by an Argentine company, "Tanque Argentino Mediano Sociedad del Estado" (or TAMSE) founded by the government in March 1980. 70% of the TAM's components were manufactured in Argentina, while the 30% manufactured in Germany corresponded to the transmission, optics and fire control system. In 1983, 20 TAMs and 26 VCTPs were delivered to the Argentine Army after an original order of 80 TAMs by Peru was canceled due to budgetary issues. In 1991, TAMSE and the TAM production line were shut down, although in 1994 TAMSE was reactivated to complete an order for 120 of both TAMs and VCTPs to replace the M4 Shermans in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Brigade of the Argentine Army. By 1995 the Argentine Army was equipped with 200 TAM tanks and 216 VCTP and VCPC armored vehicles. Although 25 VCA-155s were originally planned for production starting in 1990, only 19 were completed and delivered by 1995, along with 50 VCTMs. No other variants of the TAM, including the VCLC, VAC and VCRT were put into production due to budget restrictions.

The TAMSE plant is a facility. The factory is completely covered, with two warehouses for storing components, quality control laboratories, a project office, an engine test room and a firing range. Also participating in the production of TAM and variant components were Argentine companies Military Factories General San Martín (manufacturing the chassis), Río Tercero (turret and armament) and Bator Cocchis, S.A.

The TAM has never been exported, although a number of nations were interested in buying it. In 1981, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> signed a contract for 102 vehicles of the TAM family, including the tank, VCTP and VCRT (renaming these Lion, Tiger and Elephant, respectively). None of these vehicles were delivered and Malaysia chose instead to procure Poland's <a href="PT-91">PT-91</a>. In mid-1983, Peru established a contract for 80 TAMs. Due to budgetary problems the order was canceled after 20 tanks had been completed. A similar order was established by <a href="Panama">Panama</a> in 1984, and was canceled as well. In 1989 the TAM competed in a tank procurement order from <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, alongside the American <a href="Stingray%20light%20tank">Stingray light tank</a>, the <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n <a href="SK-105%20K%C3%BCrassier">SK-105 Kürassier</a> and the French AMX-13-105 light tank. The TAM achieved 950 out of 1,000 points, while its closest competitor earned 750 points, but in the end Ecuador did not procure any of the vehicles presented.

In the Middle East, both <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> expressed interest in the TAM. The Iranian deal fell through after <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> successfully appealed to Germany to cancel the order. TAMSE attempted to sell 60 tanks through a Panamanian company, Agrometal, offering this company a commission worth 10% of the contract's price. This failed when TAMSE lowered the price of the vehicles, angering the Iranian government, which subsequently canceled the offer.
The Saudi Arabian deal was scrapped when <a href="Israel">Israel</a> appealed to Germany to cancel the order. Failing to export the tank, the Argentine government closed the TAMSE fabrication plant in 1995.

The TAM did not participate in the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>, as it had not entered service before the end of the conflict.

Seventeen VCTPs were deployed with an Argentina battalion to Yugoslavia during <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> peacekeeping operations.

Neville Cardus

Sir John Frederick Neville Cardus, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (3 April 188828 February 1975) was an English writer and critic. From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>"s <a href="cricket">cricket</a> correspondent in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions to these two distinct fields in the years before the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> established his reputation as one of the foremost critics of his generation.

Cardus's approach to cricket writing was innovative, turning what had previously been largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular <a href="Samuel%20Langford">Samuel Langford</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, in contrast to the objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> and <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Sir Donald Bradman</a>.

Cardus spent the Second World War years in Australia, where he wrote for "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" and gave regular radio talks. He also wrote books on music, and completed his autobiography. After his return to England he resumed his connection with "The Manchester Guardian" as its London music critic. He continued to write on cricket, and produced books on both his specialisms. Cardus's work was publicly recognised by his appointment as a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1964 and the award of a knighthood in 1966, while the music and cricket worlds acknowledged him with numerous honours. In his last years, he became a <a href="guru">guru</a> and inspirational figure to aspiring young writers.

Neville Cardus was born on 3 April 1888 in <a href="Rusholme">Rusholme</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he was known as "Fred". There has been confusion over his birth date; some sources give it as 2 April 1889, and Cardus himself hosted a dinner party on 2 April 1959 believing this to be his 70th birthday. His birth certificate, however, confirms the earlier date. Neville's mother was Ada Cardus, one of several daughters of Robert and Ann Cardus of 4 Summer Place, Rusholme. On 14 July 1888, when the baby was three months old, Ada left her parents' home and married John Frederick Newsome, a blacksmith. Apart from their shared forenames, there is no evidence that Newsome was Neville's biological father, who is described in Cardus's autobiographical works as a violinist in an orchestra. The Newsome marriage was short-lived, and within a few years Ada and Neville had returned to her parents' home in Summer Place.

Robert Cardus was a retired policeman; to augment his small pension the family took in neighbours' washing, and the household income was further supplemented by his daughters' earnings from part-time prostitution. In his autobiographical writings, Cardus refers to his home environment at Summer Place as "sordid ... unlettered and unbeautiful", yet enlivened by laughter: "Humour kept breezing in". Commentators have suggested that Cardus tended to overstate the deprived aspects of his childhood; his biographer Christopher Brookes asserts that "Cardus was the product neither of a slum, nor a cultural desert". Robert Cardus, though uneducated, was not illiterate, and was instrumental in awakening his grandson's literary interests. Theatres, libraries and other cultural facilities were easily accessible from the Cardus home.

Neville's formal schooling was limited to five years at the local <a href="School%20boards%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">board school</a>, where the curriculum was basic and the methods of tuition harsh: "[T]he boy who showed the faintest sign of freedom of the will was caned". This experience did not curb Neville's intellectual curiosity; at a very young age he was expanding his cultural horizons, through the worlds of reading and of <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> and <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>. When he was 10 years old he discovered the novels of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>; years later he wrote that there were two classes of person, "those who have it in them from birth onwards to appreciate Dickens and those who haven't. The second group should be avoided as soon as detected". His earliest creative writing took the form of a handwritten magazine, "The Boy's World", full of articles and stories he had written. He circulated it among his schoolmates, until it was discovered and torn up by an irate teacher.

After Robert Cardus's death in 1900 the family moved several times, eventually breaking up altogether. Cardus left school in 1901 and took a variety of short-term, unskilled jobs before finding more secure employment as a clerk with Flemings' marine insurance agency. He lived for a time with his Aunt Beatrice with whom, according to Brookes, he had at an early age "embarked on a lifelong love affair ... In his eyes she could do no wrong". A flamboyant character, Beatrice brought colour into Cardus's life; she encouraged him to read worthwhile books and her memory, Brookes asserts, "remained a potent inspirational force" throughout his later life as a writer. She also bought him his first <a href="cricket">cricket</a> bat.

These years were a period of intense self-education. Cardus became an habitué of the local libraries, and extended his reading from Dickens to include many of the masters of literature: <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Fielding</a>, <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Conrad</a> and—with more reservation—<a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Hardy</a> and <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>. In due course he added <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> to his curriculum; this began with his discovery of <a href="George%20Henry%20Lewes">George Henry Lewes</a>, which led him on to the works of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>, <a href="David%20Hume">Hume</a>, <a href="George%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a> and, eventually, <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>. He supplemented these studies by attending free lectures at <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Manchester University</a>, and met regularly with a group of like-minded <a href="Autodidacticism">autodidacts</a> at <a href="Alexandra%20Park%2C%20Manchester">Alexandra Park</a> or, in the winter, at the <a href="J.%20Lyons%20and%20Co.">Lyons café</a> in <a href="Albert%20Square%2C%20Manchester">Albert Square</a>, to discuss and debate for whole afternoons. At first Cardus's schedule of self-improvement was random; eventually he compiled what he called a "cultural scheme" whereby he devoted a set weekly number of hours to different subjects.
Cardus's interest in music began with the popular tunes sung by his mother and her sisters in the family home. He remembered hearing for the first time the melody of the "Vilja" song from <a href="Franz%20Leh%C3%A1r">Franz Lehár</a>'s operetta "<a href="The%20Merry%20Widow">The Merry Widow</a>", which "curled its way into my heart to stay there for a lifetime". In April 1907 he was "swept ... into the seven seas of music" by a performance of <a href="Edward%20German">Edward German</a>'s operetta "<a href="Tom%20Jones%20%28Edward%20German%29">Tom Jones</a>". "I am unable to explain", Cardus wrote many years later, "why it should have been left to Edward German—of all composers—to release the flood". He began going to the <a href="Hall%C3%A9%20Orchestra">Hallé Orchestra</a>'s concerts at the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Hall">Free Trade Hall</a> where, on 3 December 1908, he was present at the premiere of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar's</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">first symphony</a>, under <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>. He regularly attended the fortnightly concerts at the <a href="Royal%20Manchester%20College%20of%20Music">Royal Manchester College of Music</a>, where students' performances were assessed by the principal, <a href="Adolph%20Brodsky">Adolph Brodsky</a>. As part of his scheme of study, Cardus briefly took singing lessons, his only formal instruction in music. In 1912 Cardus published his first musical article, "Bantock and Style in Music", in "<a href="Musical%20Opinion">Musical Opinion</a>".

Alongside his intellectual pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As a small boy he had begun to visit <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a> to watch <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> matches: "The first cricketer I saw was <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">A.C. MacLaren</a> ... I can still see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> against Australia in which <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced <a href="off%20break">off break</a> <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a>, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the <a href="Crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".

In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a>, citing his bowling averages in Manchester <a href="club%20cricket">club cricket</a>. He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature. His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> professional, and later under the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> and England cricketer <a href="Ted%20Wainwright">Ted Wainwright</a>. Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with <a href="Cyril%20Alington">Cyril Alington</a>, the school's headmaster: "Because of Alington I call myself ... an old Salopian". Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of <a href="Gilbert%20Murray">Gilbert Murray</a>'s translation of <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>'s drama "<a href="Medea%20%28play%29">Medea</a>". In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.
Cardus did not find his duties at Shrewsbury onerous. He made frequent trips to Manchester, for Hallé concerts or to watch <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> conduct at the <a href="Manchester%20Opera%20House">Manchester Opera House</a>. He found time for other work; thus, in 1913, he was the music critic for the northern edition of "<a href="Daily%20Citizen%20%28British%20newspaper%29">The Daily Citizen</a>". This short-lived newspaper was an official organ of the early <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>; mainly out of admiration for <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> Cardus had joined the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a>, but quickly lost interest in socialism: "Their creed or system was obviously not to be a means to an end but an end in itself". According to Brookes, the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that "[t]he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons café where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity". "The Daily Citizen" paid poorly, and Cardus's association with it soon ended.

Cardus spent his winters in Manchester, studying hard in anticipation of any opportunity for an opening as a music critic, eking out his summer savings by taking temporary clerical work. Around 1916 he met Edith King, an art teacher and amateur actress who became a regular attender at the Lyons café meetings. In the summers, when Cardus returned to Shrewsbury, she kept him informed of musical and cultural events in Manchester. The Shrewsbury years, which Brookes describes as a "magical interlude", ended suddenly when, at the end of the 1916 summer, Alington was appointed headmaster of <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>. Initially it seemed likely that Cardus would join him there as his secretary, but Cardus's military exemption was under review; the uncertainty of his position ended the possibility of a post at Eton. He left Shrewsbury in September 1916 with little money, and no immediate prospects of regular work.

In the winter of 1916–17 Cardus continued his private studies while working intermittently; among various jobs, he collected insurance premiums for a <a href="burial%20society">burial society</a>. Early in January 1917 he wrote to <a href="C.%20P.%20Scott">C. P. Scott</a>, "The Manchester Guardian"s editor, asking for any available post at the paper, as "the means whereby to continue my education". To bolster his chances he enclosed specimens of his writing. The result was, first, a temporary unpaid position as Scott's secretary, but in mid-March Scott offered a job on the paper's reporting staff. The writer <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> later asserted that Cardus, who did not know <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a>, was engaged not as a reporter, but as a "writer". In Cardus's own account of these years he appears to have been fully engaged in reporters' duties, his lack of shorthand being dismissed by the chief reporter, Haslam Mills, who paraphrased <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>: "Some men are born to shorthand, others achieve shorthand, while others have shorthand thrust upon them". Mills advised Cardus to concentrate on style: "We can be decorative at times; we can even be amusing. Here, possibly, you will find scope".

Within a year Cardus had been moved from the reporters' room to take charge of the paper's "Miscellany" column. He also resumed the duties of part-time secretary to Scott, who was at this time over 70, and had edited "The Manchester Guardian" since 1872. Despite his years, he struck Cardus as "of inexhaustible energy and aliveness". Scott was a demanding employer, who gave his young writers free rein, but expected in return long hours and total dedication. Driven hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, Cardus nevertheless relished these years, and never complained to Scott of weariness. Early in 1919 his role changed again, when he was made junior drama critic under the direction of <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Montague">C.E. Montague</a>, the paper's principal theatre critic who had returned from war service with no great desire to continue in the role. Cardus's principal ambitions still lay in the direction of music criticism, though he recognised that this door was closed while <a href="Samuel%20Langford">Samuel Langford</a>, music critic since 1906, remained in post. In preparation for any opportunity that might arise in that direction, Cardus maintained a daily two-hour study of music or music literature.

In the spring of 1919, while recovering from a serious <a href="Lung">pulmonary</a> condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, <a href="William%20Percival%20Crozier">William Percival Crozier</a>, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write reports on a few matches. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to the first day of Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: "I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair ... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919". Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line "Cricketer", a position he held for 20 years.

Cardus's emergence as cricket correspondent was concurrent with another appointment, that of deputy and successor designate to Langford as music critic. In January 1920 Cardus deputised for Langford at a recital by the Russian tenor <a href="Vladimir%20Rosing">Vladimir Rosing</a>, and impressed Scott with the quality of his notice. With the succession to Langford assured, and a significant increase in salary, Cardus was happy to devote his summers exclusively to cricket. He remained circumspect about his commitment to the sport: "Never have I regarded my cricket as more than a means to an end; that end being always music". Nevertheless, he developed a style of cricket reporting that quickly lifted him to the forefront of contemporary sports writers. He did this, according to his fellow cricket writer <a href="Gerald%20Howat">Gerald Howat</a>, by using imagery and metaphor to create "a mythology of characters and scenes". <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> described Cardus as "the creat[or] of modern cricket writing".

The new sense of financial and professional security was probably instrumental in the decision of Cardus and Edith King to marry, on 17 June 1921. The marriage, which lasted until Edith's death 47 years later, was unconventional; the couple led individual lives and rarely lived together, while remaining devoted friends. Cardus described his wife as "a great spirit and character, born for sisterhood not marriage."
From this time onward, Cardus used the forename "Neville" in place of "Fred", and adopted the initials "N.C." for his music reviews, to distinguish this persona from "Cricketer". In August 1921 Cardus gained what he termed "the only scoop of my career", when he reported the unexpected victory by 28 runs of MacLaren's scratch side over the previously unbeaten <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201921">Australian touring team</a>. The match, at <a href="The%20Saffrons">The Saffrons</a> ground at <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, had attracted little interest from other cricket correspondents, being treated as a foregone conclusion.

The focus of much of Cardus's cricket writing was the Lancashire side of the inter-war years, and in particular their twice-yearly battles with rivals <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on "the match within the match", with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: "Do I add up the notes of a <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> "Vivace" to evaluate the music?" To meet Cardus's requirements, the players were sometimes "enlarged", notably <a href="Emmott%20Robinson">Emmott Robinson</a>, the veteran Yorkshire <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a> of the 1920s who through Cardus's pen became "the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character". In the 1930s, Cardus's style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">England versus Australia Test series of 1930</a> Cardus described the Australian as "an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him ... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us".

Selections from Cardus's "Manchester Guardian" cricket writings were published in a series of books between 1922 and 1937. Because of financial constraints the paper did not send "Cricketer" to Australia to cover the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">"Bodyline" tour</a> of 1932–33. Cardus was generally approving of <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Jardine's</a> controversial <a href="bodyline">bodyline</a> tactics, writing on 5 March 1933: "[H]ad [Jardine] been a weak man, all the energy of <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Larwood</a> [England's premier bowler] might have proved as vain a thing as it did in 1930". In 1936–37, Cardus accompanied the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> team to Australia; otherwise he continued to write on English domestic cricket until the 1939 season was summarily truncated. On 1 September, the day that Germany invaded Poland, Cardus observed the removal of the bust of <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> from the <a href="Lord%27s%20pavilion">Lord's pavilion</a>; he was informed by a bystander: "That means war".

Following Langford's death in May 1927, Cardus became "The Manchester Guardian"s chief music critic. For several years he had worked closely with Langford, whose influence on the younger man was equalled only by that of <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>, Langford's predecessor as the paper's music critic: "Langford taught me to feel and translate, while Newman taught me to observe and analyse". Cardus's fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music he was hearing, and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, "the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training ... he was a writer first, and a music critic second".

Cardus's lack of deference sometimes led to friction, as with <a href="Hamilton%20Harty">Hamilton Harty</a>, chief conductor of the Hallé Orchestra from 1920. In his reviews of the Hallé concerts until Harty's departure in 1933, Cardus frequently criticised the conductor's choices and interpretations. On one occasion he observed that Harty's rendering of the <a href="adagio%20%28music%29">adagio</a> in <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Ninth</a> had broken the world record for slowness, and quoted minutes and seconds. Responding to Harty's outraged protests, Cardus threatened to bring an alarm clock to the next performance, "less for critical purposes than for those of personal convenience". When Harty left, he was not replaced as chief conductor; the Hallé employed distinguished visiting conductors such as Beecham, <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a>, <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Ansermet">Ernest Ansermet</a>. Cardus considered that a lack of central direction was adversely affecting the orchestra, and his biting criticisms of some performances led to temporarily strained relations.

Cardus often expressed views contrary to popular and critical opinion. He dismissed <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" as "a sophisticated exploitation of primitive rum-ti-tum". When Harty introduced <a href="George%20Gershwin">Gershwin</a>'s symphonic poem "<a href="An%20American%20in%20Paris">An American in Paris</a>" into a Hallé concert, Cardus proposed "a 150 per cent [import] tariff against this sort of American dry-goods". He professed to think that <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a>'s "preoccupation with comic opera, to the neglect of oratorio and symphony" was a "deplorable" loss to English music, although he also wrote that without <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">Gilbert</a>, nothing of Sullivan's music would have survived. Cardus championed <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a> against the consensus of his fellow-critics: "His music looks back on days intensely lived through; it knows the pathos of mortal things doomed to fade and vanish". At the 1929 <a href="Delius%20Festival">Delius Festival</a> in London, Cardus briefly met the composer, who thought he looked too young to be "The Manchester Guardian"s music critic, and counselled him: "Don't read yourself daft. Trust to y'r emotions". Also against the grain of critical opinion, Cardus commended the then unfashionable music of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> and <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Anton Bruckner</a>.

In 1931 Cardus visited the <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>, where he met Beecham and began a friendship which lasted until Sir Thomas's death in 1961—despite numerous disagreements. One of Cardus's notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a> and Delius, as "one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell". The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus's musical calendar; in 1936 he saw <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Toscanini</a> conduct a performance there of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger">Die Meistersinger</a>" that, he said, "will remain in the mind for a lifetime ... Toscanini held us like children listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by the glow of olden times". Cardus's final prewar Salzburg visit was in 1938, just after the German-Austrian "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" which led to the withdrawal in protest of many of the Festival's leading figures.

Despite financial incentives from London newspapers, Cardus remained loyal to "The Manchester Guardian". On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Free Trade Hall closed, requisitioned for military purposes. The Hallé Society left Manchester to tour with Sargent around the north-west of England. With no music in Manchester and all first-class cricket suspended, Cardus was unemployed, "imprisoned in Manchester, useless to anybody". Thus, when he received an offer from <a href="Keith%20Murdoch">Sir Keith Murdoch</a> to join "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Melbourne%29">The Herald</a>" of Melbourne in Australia, he accepted immediately.

Cardus had been known to Australian readers since the 1920s, when "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Melbourne%29">The Argus</a>" in Melbourne reported his view that Australians made cricket "a war game ... with an intensity of purpose too deadly for a mere game." His books on cricket were widely reviewed in the Australian press in the 1920s and 30s; one critic commented in 1929, "Mr. Cardus mingles fancy with fact. The latter is preferable." Another Australian writer, quoting him extensively in 1932, observed, "Mr. Cardus is a gifted writer and a most impartial critic." By 1936 he was known to a considerable section of the Australian public as a cricket writer, although he was hardly known there in his musical capacity.

The 1936–37 MCC tour of Australia under <a href="Gubby%20Allen">G.O. Allen</a> was the occasion of Cardus's first visit to the country. During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a> and <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>". In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect. When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope for the six months of the tour without music; he was touched when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a> and <a href="Hugo%20Wolf">Hugo Wolf</a>. During this tour Cardus wrote for "The Herald" in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio.

Cardus made a private visit to Australia from mid-January to mid-March 1938. When he joined "The Herald" in 1940, his initial brief was to cover a series of concerts conducted by Beecham for the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a> (ABC). Daily contact between the two men during Beecham's time in Australia between June and October 1940 helped to consolidate their friendship. At the end of his tour Beecham tried to persuade Cardus to join him in sailing to America, asking, "Do you propose to stay in this barbarous country all your life?" Cardus insisted on remaining in Australia, but moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Concluding that he could not satisfactorily review concerts for an evening newspaper, he joined the staff of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> (SMH)".

At first Cardus failed to adjust his expectations to the prevailing standard of music-making in Australia, which was not at that
time comparable to the best on offer in Europe or America. He was accused of being "just one more sneering <a href="Alternative%20names%20for%20the%20British%23Pommy%20or%20Pom">Pommy</a> bastard come to hand down higher wisdom to the ignorant colonials." His biographer Christopher Brookes suggests that Cardus was applying critical standards "more appropriate to Salzburg than to Sydney". Over the next two years Cardus and the public slowly came to terms with each other, and by 1942 he was both popular and respected among Australians.
For ABC Cardus presented a weekly hour-long programme, "The Enjoyment of Music", which enlarged the audience for classical music across the country. His topics included concert works, such as the <a href="Late%20String%20Quartets%20%28Beethoven%29">late Beethoven string quartets</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Mahler%29">Mahler's Ninth Symphony</a>, operas including "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>" and "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>", and performers such as <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a> and <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>. He also gave a weekly, fifteen-minute talk on music, illustrated by records, for the children's <a href="Argonauts%20Club">Argonauts Club</a> programme and regularly wrote for "ABC Weekly".

Early in 1942 Cardus rented a small flat in the <a href="Kings%20Cross%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kings Cross</a> district of Sydney, where he wrote his "Ten Composers" (1945) and "Autobiography" (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined to move to a larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.

By the end of the war Cardus's thoughts were turning to England. Refusing an offer of a highly paid permanent contract to cover both music and cricket for the "SMH" he considered his options; with some reluctance he agreed to cover the MCC's 1946–47 tour of Australia for the "SMH" and also for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "The Manchester Guardian". The novelist <a href="Charles%20Langbridge%20Morgan">Charles Morgan</a> wrote of Cardus's reports, "the best [I have] read these 40 years. Who shall dare to say now that <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith</a> is forgotten?"

In April 1947 Cardus returned to England. He had not as yet decided to leave Australia permanently, but "felt in need of spiritual refreshment". He found a war-weary England in which much had changed; familiar landmarks had disappeared, and old friends and acquaintances had died. The Free Trade Hall was a burnt-out shell, and the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in London completely destroyed; however, Cardus was struck by the apparent good health of the English music scene. He also found an undamaged <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, and enjoyed a season of magnificent cricket, marked by the batting exploits of the <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> pair, <a href="Denis%20Compton%20">Denis Compton </a> and <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>. Cardus was back in Sydney by the end of the year, but early in 1948, having accepted an offer from "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" to cover that year's <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Test series against Australia</a>, he left for England again.

Another factor that brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the prospect of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of "The Sunday Times" was assumed to be imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and made it clear that he would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London "Evening Standard" to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his "Autobiography", published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201950%E2%80%9351">1950–51 England v. Australia Test series</a> for the "Sydney Morning Herald", London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with "The Manchester Guardian". In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.

In 1949 Cardus set up his London home at the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Club">National Liberal Club</a>, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, just off <a href="Baker%20Street">Baker Street</a>. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in frequent contact, until Edith's death. Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras and a host of distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a> and to <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne</a>, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the "homecoming" of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with <a href="Kathleen%20Ferrier">Kathleen Ferrier</a> singing "Land of Hope and Glory". Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, "like the woman herself ... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling for the fun and goodness of life". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.

For "The Manchester Guardian", Cardus wrote around 30 music articles a year. These included "survey" pieces, which often reflected his personal enthusiasms; a regular subject was the music of <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, who in the early 1950s was by no means a popular composer with British audiences. Cardus sought to change that, with a series of articles between 1952 and 1957 under titles such as "Mahler's Growing Influence", "Misunderstanding Mahler", and "The Mahler Problem". He wrote the first volume of a detailed analysis entitled "Gustav Mahler: His Mind and his Music"; the book, dealing with Mahler's first five symphonies, was published in 1965, but was poorly received by critics. Volume II was never written.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Cardus wrote cricket articles; these included an annual reflection for "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" and occasional columns for "The Manchester Guardian", for whom he covered the 1953 Test Matches against Australia. In the English winter of 1954–55 Cardus made his final visit to Australia, to report on the Test series for "The Sydney Morning Herald"; he undertook to write "impressions" rather than day-to-day reports on play. He found time to enjoy Sydney's theatrical and music scene, but was disappointed in what he perceived as a decline in the city's musical standards.

In the decades after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as "A great Englishman, measured by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation". In 1959, still in harness, Newman died at the age of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> (CH), or even to the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: "He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. He showed us other and more sensitive worlds". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>, <a href="Otto%20Klemperer">Otto Klemperer</a>, <a href="Clifford%20Curzon">Clifford Curzon</a> and <a href="Claudio%20Arrau">Claudio Arrau</a>; in cricket, <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> and <a href="Garfield%20Sobers">Garfield Sobers</a>. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>'s "<a href="Pli%20selon%20pli">Pli selon pli</a>" after a performance in 1965, he said he "could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music".

In 1964 Cardus was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE). In a letter to his friend Marjorie Robinson he described the investiture at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, remarking that <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a> "might have been any nice shy young lady in <a href="House%20of%20Fraser">D.H. Evans</a> or <a href="Kendals">Kendal Milnes</a>". Just over two years later Cardus was awarded a <a href="knight">knight</a>hood, the first music critic to receive such an honour, although in all likelihood it was awarded as much for his cricket writing. Years previously Beecham had advised: "In the unlikely event of you being offered a knighthood, Neville, take it. It makes tables at the Savoy so much easier to come by".

Edith Cardus died on 26 March 1968. Despite their separate day-to-day lives, she had been an influential presence for nearly all Cardus's adult life; they had communicated by telephone almost daily, and he felt her loss keenly. After her death he left the National Liberal Club and moved into her flat, which remained his base for the rest of his life. In the ensuing months he worried about his deteriorating relationship with "The Guardian"; the paper had been renamed in 1959 following reorganisation, and its editorial offices had moved to London in 1964. Cardus felt that much of the old ethos had departed, and that his once-sacrosanct copy was now at the mercy of subeditors. He was particularly incensed by the treatment meted out to his 1969 Edinburgh Festival reports, and referred to the subeditors' room as "the Abattoir" in one of many letters complaining of editorial butchery.

As well as his work for "The Guardian" Cardus wrote occasionally for "The Sunday Times", a particular pleasure to him in view of his failure to achieve Newman's post. In 1970 he published "Full Score", the last of his autobiographical works and, in Daniels's view, the least substantial of all the Cardus books. In his eighties, Cardus assumed the role of guru to young aspiring writers, before whom he would hold court in favourite locations: the Garrick Club, the National Liberal Club, or Lord's. According to Daniels, Cardus "thrived in the role of patron, encourager, [and] "accoucheur"". Howat describes his appearance in these years as not having changed much from his younger days: "... the lean, ascetic figure of moderate height, with sharp features, sleek hair, and strong glasses".

Cardus died on 28 February 1975 at the Nuffield Clinic, London, a few days after collapsing at home. His cremation service was private. On 4 April more than 200 people attended a memorial service at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>. These included representatives from Cardus's worlds of cricket, journalism and music. <a href="Flora%20Robson">Flora Robson</a> and <a href="Wendy%20Hiller">Wendy Hiller</a> gave readings, and Clifford Curzon, with the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, played the second movement of Mozart's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2023%20%28Mozart%29">Piano Concerto No. 23</a>. The eulogy was given by the cricket writer and historian <a href="Alan%20Gibson">Alan Gibson</a>, who took as his text verses from <a href="William%20Blake">Blake's</a> "<a href="Auguries%20of%20Innocence">Auguries of Innocence</a>":<poem>
Joy and woe are woven fine,
A clothing for the soul divine;
Under every grief and pine
Runs a thread of silken twine.
</poem>

Cardus's contribution to cricket writing has been acknowledged by various commentators on the game. <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> wrote: "Before him, cricket was reported ... with him it was for the first time appreciated, felt, and imaginatively described." Howat commented: "He would have his imitators and parodists, and no serious cricket writer would remain unaffected by him". His influence on his successors was more specifically acknowledged by Gibson:

"All cricket writers of the last half century have been influenced by Cardus, whether they admit it or not, whether they have wished to be or not, whether they have tried to copy him or tried to avoid copying him. He was not a model, any more than Macaulay, say, was a model for the aspiring historian. But just as Macaulay changed the course of the writing of history, Cardus changed the course of the writing of cricket. He showed what could be done. He dignified and illuminated the craft".

As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive approach was the opposite of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman "probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom and listened to the beating of her heart." Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> wrote that he "reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart as well as of the mind ... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> highlighted "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.

Beside his CBE and knighthood, Cardus received numerous honours from the musical and cricketing worlds, at home and overseas. In 1963 he was awarded the <a href="Bayreuth">City of Bayreuth</a>'s Wagner Medal; he was given honorary membership of the <a href="Royal%20Northern%20College%20of%20Music">Royal Manchester College of Music</a> in 1968, and of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> in 1972. The Hallé Orchestra honoured him with two special concerts in April 1966 to mark his long association with the orchestra. In 1970 he received the <a href="Austrian%20Decoration%20for%20Science%20and%20Art">Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class</a>. Among the honours he most valued was the presidency of Lancashire County Cricket Club, which he accepted in 1971.

Cardus was not an <a href="The%20Establishment">"establishment"</a> figure. His friends encountered initial resistance when they sought his election to the MCC, although he was eventually accepted in 1958. He was denied the civic honour of the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the City</a> of Manchester, and although he made light of this omission he was hurt by it. Long after his death, the city named a pathway close to the rebuilt Summer Place "Neville Cardus Walk". Aside from formal institutional recognition, Cardus was highly regarded by prominent individual cricketers and musicians, as indicated by the "tribute book" he received at his 70th birthday celebration lunch. The book included contributions from <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>, <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, and also from Klemperer, <a href="Elisabeth%20Schwarzkopf">Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</a> and <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a>. He managed to maintain close friendships with both Beecham and <a href="John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a>, though the two conductors cordially disliked one another.

In the conventional sense, Cardus was not a religious man; <a href="Dennis%20Silk">Dennis Silk</a>, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus's religion was "friendship". In "Autobiography" Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, "the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent"—though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, when he came to understand the late string quartets of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>. He ends his autobiography by declaring: "If <a href="Messiah%20Part%20III%23Part%20III%20movements">I know that my Redeemer liveth</a> it is not on the church's testimony, but because of what Handel affirms".

Within the relaxed framework of his marriage, Cardus enjoyed relationships with many women. These included Hilda "Barbe" Ede, with whom he shared a passionate affair in the 1930s before her sudden death in 1937; Cardus referred to her as "Milady", and devoted a chapter of "Full Score" to her. After his return from Australia his closest women friends were <a href="Margaret%20Hughes%20%28sportswriter%29">Margaret Hughes</a> and Else Mayer-Lismann, to whom he referred respectively as his "cricket wife" and his "music wife". Hughes, who was more than 30 years younger than Cardus, became his literary executor after his death, and edited several collections of his cricketing and musical writings.

The list includes all original works together with collections, anthologies and books edited or jointly edited by Cardus. Posthumous publications are included. Publication year relates to the original edition; many of the books have been reissued, often by different publishers.
