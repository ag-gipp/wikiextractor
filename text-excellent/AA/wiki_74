No. 37 Squadron RAAF

No. 37 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Tactical%20airlift">medium tactical airlift</a> squadron. It operates <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20C-130J%20Hercules">Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules</a> aircraft from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales. The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War II, the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the <a href="Operation%20Slipper">wars in Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Iraq</a>, and the <a href="military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">military intervention against ISIL</a>. It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including in <a href="Operation%20Solace">Somalia</a>, <a href="Operation%20Warden">East Timor</a>, <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">Bali</a>, <a href="Operation%20Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Assist">Papua New Guinea</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20military%20operations%20involving%20Australia">the Philippines</a>.

The squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, in July 1943, and equipped with <a href="Lockheed%20Model%2018%20Lodestar">Lockheed C-60 Lodestars</a> that it operated in Australia, New Guinea and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Towards the end of the war it began flying <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>. It became part of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Transport) Wing</a>, headquartered at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a>, New South Wales, in 1946 but was disbanded two years later. In response to Australia's increasing air transport needs during the Vietnam War, the squadron was re-formed at Richmond in February 1966, and equipped with the Hercules. It converted to the C-130J model in 1999, and between 2006 and 2012 also operated C-130Hs formerly of <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 36 Squadron</a>. No. 37 Squadron came under the control of a re-formed No. 86 Wing from 1987 until 2010, when it was transferred to <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a>.

No. 37 Squadron is currently tasked with <a href="Tactical%20airlift">medium tactical airlift</a> in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, <a href="search-and-rescue">search-and-rescue</a>, and <a href="airdrop">airdrop</a> missions. It is located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and controlled by <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Mobility%20Group%20RAAF">Air Mobility Group</a>. As of July 2013, the squadron comprised over 400 personnel organised into four <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flights</a> of aircrew, an administrative and operational section, and a maintenance section responsible for day-to-day aircraft servicing as well as regular maintenance cycles of six weeks' duration. Intermediate and heavy maintenance is contracted to <a href="Airbus%20Helicopters">Airbus Group Australia Pacific</a> (airframe) and <a href="Dunlop%20Standard%20Aerospace%20Group">StandardAero</a> (engines). No. 37 Squadron's motto is "Foremost".

The squadron operates twelve <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20C-130J%20Hercules">Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules</a>, which entered service in 1999. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a <a href="loadmaster">loadmaster</a>, the latter being responsible for the loading, carriage and unloading of cargo and passengers. The C-130J can carry of cargo, or some 120 passengers. It has a range of over without payload, and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips. <a href="No.%20285%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 285 Squadron</a>, also based at Richmond under No. 84 Wing, is equipped with a C-130J <a href="Flight%20simulator">full-flight mission simulator</a>, C-130 airframes, and other instructional tools, and is responsible for training No. 37 Squadron's aircrew and maintenance personnel. maintains a detachment of two aircraft at <a href="Al%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMinhad%20Air%20Base">Al Minhad Air Base</a> in the United Arab Emirates to support operations in the Middle East Region under <a href="Operation%20Slipper">Operation Accordion</a>. The C-130Js are expected to remain in RAAF service until 2030.

No. 37 (Transport) Squadron was formed on 15 July 1943 at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, with a staff of two officers and thirteen airmen. Its inaugural commanding officer, <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Neville Hemsworth (late of <a href="No.%2034%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 34 Squadron</a>), arrived on 21 July, and its first aircraft, a single-engined <a href="Northrop%20Delta">Northrop Delta</a> (also formerly of No. 34 Squadron), was delivered on 2 August. The squadron was allocated the first of a batch of ten twin-engined <a href="Lockheed%20Model%2018%20Lodestar">Lockheed C-60 Lodestar</a> transports on 23 August. The Delta was written off following an accident on 30 September. By then the squadron's staff numbered 190, including forty-five officers. It was declared operational on 11 October 1943, undertaking regular courier flights across Australia to destinations including <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Western Australia; <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> and <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>, Northern Territory; <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, South Australia; <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Queensland">Maryborough</a>, Queensland; and <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Tasmania.
By mid-1944, the squadron had expanded its operations to New Guinea, making courier flights to <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> initially, and later <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>, <a href="Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a> and <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>. It transferred to <a href="Essendon%20Airport">Essendon</a>, Victoria, on 1 September. The unit was now one of eight Australian transport squadrons, all of which operated under the control of RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Their primary duty was supporting the Australian military, though they could also be released for urgent requests by General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> headquarters. A Lodestar crashed and burned on takeoff at Merauke on 26 January 1945 but all aboard escaped injury; it was the only hull loss suffered by the type in Australian service. No. 37 Squadron received its first three <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a> the following month, and by the end of March had a complement of eighteen aircraft: nine Dakotas, seven Lodestars, a <a href="Douglas%20DC-2">Douglas DC-2</a>, and a <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a>. The next month it began operating detachments out of <a href="Parafield%20Airport">Parafield</a>, South Australia, and <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. On 6 July 1945, one of the squadron's Dakotas transported the body of Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> from Canberra to Perth for burial. By September 1945, No. 37 Squadron's strength was 357 staff, including 111 officers, sixteen Dakotas, two Lodestars, a DC-2, and a Tiger Moth.

Following the end of hostilities, No. 37 Squadron repatriated former prisoners of war from <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> to Australia. On 27 July 1946, it moved to <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a>, New South Wales, where it came under the control of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Transport) Wing</a> along with <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 36</a> and <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">38 Squadrons</a>, also operating Dakotas. Another unit of No. 86 Wing, <a href="No.%20486%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>, was responsible for servicing the Dakotas. On 30 September 1946, No. 37 Squadron was assigned the regular courier service to Japan that had previously been flown by No. 36 Squadron, to support the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>. In January 1947, No. 37 Squadron handed over the Japan courier run to No. 38 Squadron, and the following month took over the <a href="Lae">Lae</a> courier service previously flown by No. 36 Squadron; the <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> courier run was added in April. By the end of 1947, No. 37 Squadron's personnel numbered fifty-six, including twenty-four officers, and it had an average of ten Dakotas on strength. The unit was disbanded at Schofields on 24 February 1948.

On 27 September 1965, Minister for Air <a href="Peter%20Howson%20%28politician%29">Peter Howson</a> announced that No. 37 Squadron was to be re-raised to operate twelve <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130E Hercules</a> transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments. The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21 February 1966, under the command of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> Ron McKimm. It joined No. 36 Squadron, which had been operating C-130A Hercules since 1958. No. 486 Squadron, disbanded in 1964, was re-formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons; major repairs and upgrades to the C-130s were the responsibility of <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 2 Aircraft Depot</a> (later No. 503 Wing). As the C-130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C-130A, No. 37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks, while No. 36 Squadron's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature. No. 37 Squadron began taking delivery of its C-130Es in August, and by the end of September its staff numbered eighty-six, including twenty-one officers. In February 1967, the squadron commenced long-range missions in support of Australian forces in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, including aero-medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia, generally via <a href="RMAF%20Base%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a>, Malaysia. Initially both C-130A and E models were employed for such evacuations, but only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967, as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required. By the end of February 1968, No. 37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel: eighty-five aircrew, including fifty-one officers, and 122 ground staff, including three officers. The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972, following the Federal government's decision to withdraw from the conflict.
As well as participating in military exercises and overseas peacekeeping commitments, the Hercules became a familiar sight in the Southern Pacific, called on for relief operations following many natural disasters including tsunamis in New Guinea, cyclones in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomons</a> and <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, and fires and floods throughout Australia. It played a major role in the evacuation of civilians following <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> in Darwin in 1974–75; a No. 37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster. The squadron contributed eleven aircraft to the relief effort, carrying 4,400 passengers and of cargo. No. 37 Squadron aircraft took part in <a href="Operation%20Babylift">Operation Babylift</a>, the US-led effort to evacuate the orphaned children of American servicemen from Vietnam in April 1975. Later that month, two of the squadron's aircraft were assigned to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) to transport supplies throughout South East Asia; the C-130s' Australian <a href="roundel">roundel</a>s were painted over with UN symbols to signify the mission's neutrality. Commencing operations in May, the aircraft flew supplies into Laos and transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore, completing ninety-one sorties by the time the mission ended in early June. The Hercules also evacuated Australian embassy personnel from <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, South Vietnam, and <a href="Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a>, Cambodia, following the end of the Vietnam War. No. 37 Squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> by the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Australia">Governor General</a> in June 1976 for its performance in 1974–75.

In January–February 1979, two No. 37 Squadron C-130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-<a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>s, handing them over to No. 33 Flight (later <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a>) at the beginning of 1981. No. 37 Squadron transported the <a href="Popemobile">Popemobile</a>s on <a href="John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a>'s 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's <a href="Terracotta%20Army">Entombed Warriors</a>. In February 1987, the unit again joined No. 36 Squadron, along with No. 33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No. 86 Wing under the newly established <a href="Air%20Lift%20Group%20RAAF">Air Lift Group</a> (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No. 37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the <a href="1989%20Australian%20pilots%27%20dispute">1989 Australian pilots' dispute</a> that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons flew missions to <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> in support of <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%201991%20Gulf%20War">Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War</a>. No. 37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of <a href="Operation%20Solace">Operation Solace</a> in January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No. 486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 maintenance functions to Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons. No. 37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting <a href="International%20Force%20for%20East%20Timor">INTERFET</a> forces in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> between September 1999 and February 2000, under <a href="Operation%20Warden">Operation Warden</a>. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">Bali bombings</a> in October 2002.
In September 2004, aircraft from No. 37 Squadron joined the rotating detachment of C-130s established by No. 36 Squadron in the <a href="Middle%20East%20Area%20of%20Operations">Middle East Area of Operations</a> (MEAO) in February 2003, following the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>; the C-130Js were required to be fitted with self-protection equipment before deploying to the MEAO. No. 37 Squadron was strengthened to create a "super squadron" on 17 November 2006, when its force of twelve C-130Js was augmented by No. 36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, prior to the latter re-equipping with <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III">Boeing C-17 Globemasters</a> and relocating to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribous</a> from No. 38 Squadron as part of the RAAF's initial contribution to <a href="Operation%20Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Assist">Operation Papua New Guinea Assist</a> following <a href="Cyclone%20Guba">Cyclone Guba</a> in November 2007. No. 37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js completed the detachment's 20,000th hour of flying operations. The squadron was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing on 1 October 2010, as part of a restructure of Air Lift Group. It was presented with the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency in 2011 at a ceremony on 31 May 2012. The C-130Hs were retired the same year, the last pair at Richmond on 30 November. In January 2013, No. 37 Squadron undertook a successful search-and-rescue mission for Alain Delord, a missing round-the-world yachtsman who was found approximately south of Tasmania. Crews located Delord adrift in a life raft before airdropping supplies, maintaining watch and ultimately guiding in a rescue vessel fifty-eight hours later. 

No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in March 2013. It celebrated its 70th Anniversary on 17 July, undertaking a two-ship flight over Sydney and the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>. That November, the squadron deployed to the Philippines to participate in humanitarian relief operations in the wake of <a href="Typhoon%20Haiyan">Typhoon Haiyan</a>. In August 2014, aircraft from No. 37 Squadron based in the Middle East were involved in the airdrop of humanitarian supplies to civilians in Iraq following an offensive by <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State</a> forces. The first drop occurred on the night of 13/14 August, when one of the squadron's C-130Js took part in a 16-aircraft mission including US C-17s and C-130Hs and a British C-130J that delivered supplies to <a href="Yezidi">Yezidi</a> civilians trapped on <a href="Mount%20Sinjar">Mount Sinjar</a>. According to the Australian Department of Defence, it was the RAAF's "most complex operational humanitarian air drop mission in more than a decade". A second drop was conducted to deliver supplies to isolated civilians in the northern Iraqi town of <a href="Amirli">Amirli</a>. By September 2014, the RAAF's C-130Js had accumulated over 100,000 flying hours. Later that month, a C-130J took part in the airlift of arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq; the involvement of RAAF transport aircraft in operations in Iraq is ongoing. From 7 to 10 December 2015, a C-130J of No. 37 Squadron flying out of <a href="Guam">Guam</a> joined American and Japanese aircraft in <a href="Operation%20Christmas%20Drop">Operation Christmas Drop</a>, a humanitarian aerial supply operation in the west Pacific and Micronesia. No. 37 Squadron was awarded the <a href="Meritorious%20Unit%20Citation">Meritorious Unit Citation</a> in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for "sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014".

The Three Sisters are volcanic peaks that form a <a href="complex%20volcano">complex volcano</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. They are part of the <a href="Cascade%20Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanic Arc</a>, a segment of the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> in western North America extending from southern <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> through <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and Oregon to <a href="Northern%20California">Northern California</a>. Each more than in elevation, they are the third-, fourth- and fifth-highest peaks in Oregon. Located in the <a href="Three%20Sisters%20Wilderness">Three Sisters Wilderness</a> at the boundary of <a href="Lane%20County%2C%20Oregon">Lane</a> and <a href="Deschutes%20County%2C%20Oregon">Deschutes</a> counties and the <a href="Willamette%20National%20Forest">Willamette</a> and <a href="Deschutes%20National%20Forest">Deschutes</a> national forests, they are about south of the nearest town, <a href="Sisters%2C%20Oregon">Sisters</a>. Diverse species of flora and fauna inhabit the area, which is subject to frequent snowfall, occasional rain, and extreme temperature variation between seasons. The mountains, particularly South Sister, are popular destinations for climbing and <a href="scrambling">scrambling</a>.

Although they are often grouped together as one unit, the three mountains have their own individual geology and eruptive history. Neither nor has erupted in the last 14,000 years, and it is considered unlikely that either will ever erupt again. last erupted about 2,000 years ago and could erupt in the future, threatening life within the region. After satellite imagery detected <a href="tectonic%20uplift">tectonic uplift</a> near in 2000, the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> improved monitoring in the immediate area.

The Three Sisters are at the boundary of <a href="Lane%20County%2C%20Oregon">Lane</a> and <a href="Deschutes%20County%2C%20Oregon">Deschutes</a> counties and the <a href="Willamette%20National%20Forest">Willamette</a> and <a href="Deschutes%20National%20Forest">Deschutes</a> national forests in the U.S. state of Oregon, about south of the nearest town of <a href="Sisters%2C%20Oregon">Sisters</a>. The three peaks are the third-, fourth-, and fifth-highest in Oregon, and contain 16 named glaciers. Their ice volume totals . The Sisters were named Faith, Hope and Charity by early settlers, but are now known as North Sister, Middle Sister and South Sister, respectively.

The <a href="Three%20Sisters%20Wilderness">Three Sisters Wilderness</a> covers an area of , making it the second-largest <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a> in Oregon. Designated by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> in 1964, it borders the <a href="Mount%20Washington%20Wilderness">Mount Washington Wilderness</a> to the north and shares its southern edge with the <a href="Waldo%20Lake%20Wilderness">Waldo Lake Wilderness</a>. The area includes of trails and many forests, lakes, waterfalls, and streams, including the <a href="River%20source">source</a> of <a href="Whychus%20Creek">Whychus Creek</a>. The Three Sisters and nearby <a href="Broken%20Top">Broken Top</a> account for about a third of the Three Sisters Wilderness, and this area is known as the Alpine Crest Region. Rising from about to in elevation, the Alpine Crest Region features the wilderness area's most-frequented glaciers, lakes, and meadows.

Weather varies greatly in the area due to the <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> caused by the Cascade Range. Air from the Pacific Ocean rises over the western slopes, which causes it to cool and dump its moisture as rain (or snow in the winter). Precipitation increases with elevation. Once the moisture is wrung from the air, it descends on the eastern side of the crest, which causes the air to be warmer and drier. On the western slopes, precipitation ranges from annually, while precipitation over the eastern slopes varies from in the east. Temperature extremes reach in summers and during the winters.

The Three Sisters have about 130 snowfields and glaciers ranging in altitude from with a cumulative surface area of about . The <a href="Linn%20Glacier">Linn</a> and <a href="Villard%20Glacier">Villard Glacier</a>s are north of the North Sister Summit, while the <a href="Thayer%20Glacier">Thayer Glacier</a> is on its eastern slope. The <a href="Collier%20Glacier">Collier Glacier</a> is nestled between North Sister and Middle Sister and flows to the northwest. The <a href="Renfrew%20Glacier">Renfrew</a> and <a href="Hayden%20Glacier">Hayden Glacier</a>s are the northwestern and northeastern slopes of Middle Sister, respectively, while the <a href="Diller%20Glacier">Diller Glacier</a> is on its southeastern slope. The <a href="Irving%20Glacier%20%28Oregon%29">Irving</a>, <a href="Carver%20Glacier">Carver</a> and <a href="Skinner%20Glacier%20%28Oregon%29">Skinner Glacier</a>s lie between Middle Sister and South Sister. Finally, around the summit of South Sister, in a clockwise direction, are the <a href="Prouty%20Glacier">Prouty</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Glacier%20%28Oregon%29">Lewis</a>, <a href="Clark%20Glacier%20%28Oregon%29">Clark</a>, <a href="Lost%20Creek%20Glacier">Lost Creek</a>, and <a href="Eugene%20Glacier">Eugene Glacier</a>s. The Collier Glacier, despite a retreat and a 64% loss of its surface area between 1910 and 1994, is generally considered to be the largest of the Three Sisters at . <a href="Eliot%20Glacier">Eliot Glacier</a> on <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a> is now two-and-a-half times larger than the Collier Glacier. According to sources, the Prouty Glacier is sometimes considered to be larger than the Collier glacier.

When <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a> glaciers retreated during the 20th century, water filled in the spaces left behind, forming <a href="moraine-dammed%20lake">moraine-dammed lake</a>s, which are more common in the Three Sisters Wilderness than anywhere else in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. The local area has a history of <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s, including an event on October 7, 1966, caused by a sudden avalanche; this flash flood reached the <a href="Cascade%20Lakes%20Scenic%20Byway">Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway</a>. Concerned about the hazard of similar flooding events, scientists in the 1980s from the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) identified that Carver Lake on South Sister could flood and breach its <a href="Dam%23Natural%20dams">natural dam</a>, producing a large mudflow that could endanger wilderness visitors and the town of Sisters. Studies at Collier Lake and Diller Lake suggested that both had breached their dams in the early 1940s and in 1970, respectively. Other moraine-dammed lakes within the wilderness area include Thayer Lake on North Sister's east flank and four members of the Chambers Lakes group between Middle and South Sister.

Before settlement of the area at the end of the 19th century, <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s frequently burned through the local forests, especially the <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a> forests on the eastern slopes. Due to fire suppression over the past century, the forests have become overgrown, and at higher elevations, they are further susceptible to summertime fires, which threaten surrounding life and property. In the 21st century, wildfires have been larger and more common in the Deschutes National Forest. In September 2012, a lightning strike caused a fire that burned in the Pole Creek area within the Three Sisters Wilderness, leaving the area closed until May 2013. In August 2017, officials closed in the western half of the Three Sisters Wilderness, including of the <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>, to the public because of 11 lightning-caused fires, including the <a href="Milli%20Fire">Milli Fire</a>. As a result of the increasing incidence of fires, public officials have factored the role of wildfire into planning, including organizing prescribed fires with scientists to protect habitats at risk while minimizing adverse effects on air quality and environmental health.

The Three Sisters join several other volcanoes in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north–south. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north–south <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a> in the surrounding region.

The peaks form a <a href="complex%20volcano">complex volcanic group</a> that extends for . Part of the <a href="Cascade%20Volcanic%20Arc">Cascade Volcanic Arc</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, the individual volcanoes formed during separate time periods from several variable magmatic sources, and the amount of <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> present in the lavas of the younger two mountains is unusual relative to nearby peaks. The Three Sisters form the leading edge of a rhyolitic crustal-melting anomaly, which might be explained by a combination of <a href="Mantle%20convection">mantle flow</a> (movement of Earth's solid silicate mantle layer caused by convection currents) and <a href="Igneous%20rock%23Decompression">decompression</a> that has generated similar melting and rhyolitic volcanism nearby for the past 16 million years. Like other Cascade volcanoes, the Three Sisters were fed by magma chambers produced by the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Juan%20de%20Fuca%20Plate">Juan de Fuca tectonic plate</a> under the western edge of the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American tectonic plate</a>.

The three mountains were also shaped by the changing climate of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> Epoch, during which multiple <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a>s occurred and <a href="glacial%20motion">glacial advance</a> <a href="erosion">eroded</a> the mountains. 
The Three Sisters form the center of a region of closely grouped volcanic peaks. This is in contrast to the typical spacing between volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascades. Among the most active volcanic areas in the Cascades and one of the most densely populated volcanic centers in the world, the Three Sisters region includes nearby peaks such as <a href="Belknap%20Crater">Belknap Crater</a>, <a href="Mount%20Washington%20%28Oregon%29">Mount Washington</a>, <a href="Black%20Butte%20%28Oregon%29">Black Butte</a>, and <a href="Three%20Fingered%20Jack">Three Fingered Jack</a> to the north, and Broken Top and <a href="Mount%20Bachelor">Mount Bachelor</a> to the south. Most of the surrounding volcanoes consist of <a href="mafic">mafic</a> (basaltic) lavas; only South and Middle Sister have an abundance of <a href="silicic">silicic</a> rocks such as <a href="andesite">andesite</a>, <a href="dacite">dacite</a>, and <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a>. Mafic magma is less <a href="Viscosity">viscous</a>; it produces lava flows and is less prone to explosive eruptions than silicic magma.

The region was active in the Pleistocene, with eruptions between about 650,000 and about 250,000 years ago from an explosively active complex known as the Tumalo volcanic center. This area features andesitic and mafic <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s such as <a href="Lava%20Butte">Lava Butte</a>, as well as <a href="lava%20dome">rhyolite dome</a>s. Cinder cones accumulate from the airfall of many <a href="pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic rock</a> fragments of various sizes, while the viscous rhyolite domes extrude onto the surface like toothpaste.

The Tumalo volcano spread <a href="ignimbrite">ignimbrite</a>s and <a href="plinian%20eruption">plinian</a> deposits in ground eruptions across the area, similar to the <a href="Eruption%20of%20Mount%20Vesuvius%20in%2079">eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii</a>. These deposits spread from <a href="Tumalo%2C%20Oregon">Tumalo</a> to the town of <a href="Bend%2C%20Oregon">Bend</a>. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>ic lava flows from North Sister overlay the youngest Tumalo pyroclastic deposits, indicating that North Sister was active more recently than 260,000 years ago.

North Sister, also known as "Faith", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a> that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is wide, and its summit elevation is . Consisting primarily of <a href="basaltic%20andesite">basaltic andesite</a>, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in <a href="palagonite">palagonite</a> and red and black <a href="cinder">cinder</a>s, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>s demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>.

North Sister possesses more <a href="dike%20%28geology%29">dikes</a> than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a -wide <a href="volcanic%20plug">volcanic plug</a>. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion. At one point, the volcano stood more than high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn.

Middle Sister, also known as "Hope", is a basaltic <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> that has also erupted more-viscous andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. The smallest and least studied of the three, Middle Sister began eruptive activity 48,000 years ago, and it was primarily built by eruptions occurring between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago. One of the earliest major eruptive events (about 38,000 years ago) produced the rhyolite of Obsidian Cliffs on the mountain's northwestern flank. Thick and rich in dacite, the flows extended from the northern and southern sides. They stand in contrast to older, andesitic lava remains that reach as far as from its base.

With an elevation of , the mountain is cone-shaped. The eastern side has been heavily eroded by glaciation, while the western face is mostly intact. Of the Three Sisters, Middle Sister has the largest ice cover. The Hayden and Diller glaciers continue to cut into the east face, while the Renfrew Glacier sits on the northwestern slope. The large but retreating , which contains of ice and is the thickest and largest glacier in the region, descends along the north side of Middle Sister, cutting into the west side of North Sister. Erosion from Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation exposed a plug near the center of Middle Sister.

South Sister, also known as "Charity", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at . The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread <a href="tephra">volcanic ash</a> from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions.

Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded <a href="summit%20crater">summit crater</a> about in diameter that holds a small <a href="crater%20lake">crater lake</a> known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red <a href="scoria">scoria</a> and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria. Hodge Crest, a <a href="false%20peak">false peak</a>, formed between 28,000 and 24,000 years ago, roughly around the same time as the main cone.

Despite its relatively young age, every part of South Sister other than its peak has undergone significant erosion due to Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation. Between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, South Sister's southern flanks were covered with <a href="ice%20stream">ice stream</a>s, and a small amount of ice extended below . On the volcano's northern flank, below the summit peak, erosion from these glaciers exposed a <a href="headwall">headwall</a> about high. During the Holocene, smaller glaciers formed, alternating between advance and retreat, depositing <a href="moraine">moraine</a>s and <a href="till">till</a> between on the mountain. The Lewis and |Clark glaciers have <a href="cirque">cirque</a>s, or glacial valleys, that made the outer walls of the crater rim significantly steeper. The slopes of South Sister contain small glaciers, including the Lost Creek and Prouty glaciers.

When the first geological reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region was published in 1925, its author, Edwin T. Hodge, suggested that the Three Sisters and five smaller mountains in the present-day wilderness area were the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano that had been active during the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> or early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> epochs. Naming this ancient volcano <a href="Mount%20Multnomah">Mount Multnomah</a>, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a <a href="caldera">caldera</a> just as <a href="Mount%20Mazama">Mount Mazama</a> collapsed to form <a href="Crater%20Lake">Crater Lake</a>. In the 1940s, <a href="Howel%20Williams">Howel Williams</a> completed an analysis of the Three Sisters vicinity and concluded that Multnomah had never existed, instead demonstrating that each volcano in the area possessed its own individual eruptive history. Williams' 1944 paper defined the basic outline of the Three Sisters vicinity, though he lacked access to chemical techniques and <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>. Over the past 70 years, scientists have published several reconnaissance maps and <a href="petrography">petrographic</a> studies of the Three Sisters, including a detailed <a href="geological%20map">geological map</a> published in 2012.

Neither North nor Middle Sister is likely to resume volcanic activity. An eruption from South Sister would pose a threat to nearby life, as the proximal danger zone extends from the volcano's summits. During an eruption, tephra could accumulate to in the city of Bend, and <a href="lahar">mudflows</a> and <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s could run down the sides of the mountain, threatening any life in their paths. Eruptions from South Sister could be either <a href="explosive%20eruption">explosive</a> or <a href="effusive%20eruption">effusive</a>, though an eruption of ash with local volcanic rock accumulation and slow lava flows is considered most likely. The Three Sisters area does not have <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a> activity, although there are <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s west of South Sister.

From 1986 to 1987, the USGS surveyed the Three Sisters vicinity with tilt-leveling networks and electro-optical distance meters, but South Sister was not the subject of close <a href="geodesy">geodetic</a> analysis for the next two decades. The volcano was found to be potentially active in 2000, when satellite imagery showed a deforming <a href="tectonic%20uplift">tectonic uplift</a> west of the mountain. The ground began to bulge in late 1997, as magma started to pool about underground. Scientists became concerned that the volcano was awakening, but examination of interferograms, or diagrams of patterns formed by <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">wave interference</a>, revealed that only small amounts of deformation occurred. A 2002 study inferred that the composition of intruding magma was basaltic or rhyolitic. A map at the Lava Lands Visitor Center of the <a href="Newberry%20National%20Volcanic%20Monument">Newberry National Volcanic Monument</a> south of Bend shows the extent of the uplift, which reaches a maximum of . In 2004, an <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a> occurred with an <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> in the area of uplift; the hundreds of small earthquakes subsided after several days. According to a 2011 study, this swarm may have initiated a significant decrease in the peak uplift rate, which dropped by 80 percent after 2004. By 2007 the uplift had slowed, though the area was still considered potentially active.

A study published in 2010 described the magma intrusion as having a volume of about . Scientists determined in 2013 that the uplift had slowed to a rate of about per year, compared to up to per year in the early 2000s. Because of the uplift at South Sister, the USGS planned to increase monitoring of the Three Sisters and their vicinity by installing a <a href="global%20positioning%20system">global positioning system</a> (GPS) receiver, sampling airborne and ground-based gases, and adding <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a>s. The agency completed a GPS survey campaign, including planning, documentation, and data processing and archiving, at South Sister in 2001, as well as annual <a href="Interferometric%20synthetic-aperture%20radar">InSAR</a> radar observations from 1992 to 2001, and it followed up with campaign GPS and tilt-leveling surveys in August 2004. As of 2009, semi-permanent GPS networks have been deployed every year at the Three Sisters complex, continually showing that inflation persists at South Sister.

The ecology of the Three Sisters reflect their location in central Oregon's Cascade Range. The westside slopes from lie in the <a href="Cascades%20%28ecoregion%29%23Western%20Cascades%20Montane%20Highlands%20%284b%29">Western Cascade Montane Highlands ecoregion</a>, where precipitation is abundant. Forests here consist predominantly of <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> and <a href="western%20hemlock">western hemlock</a>, with minor components of <a href="mountain%20hemlock">mountain hemlock</a>, <a href="noble%20fir">noble fir</a>, <a href="subalpine%20fir">subalpine fir</a>, <a href="grand%20fir">grand fir</a>, <a href="Pacific%20silver%20fir">Pacific silver fir</a>, <a href="red%20alder">red alder</a>, and <a href="Pacific%20yew">Pacific yew</a>. <a href="Vine%20maple">Vine maple</a>s, <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>, <a href="Oregon%20grape">Oregon grape</a>, <a href="huckleberry">huckleberry</a>, and <a href="thimbleberry">thimbleberry</a> grow beneath the trees. Douglas-fir is dominant below , while western hemlock dominates above.

<a href="Treeline">Timberline</a> at the Three Sisters occurs at , where the forest canopy opens and the <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> zone begins. These forests lie in the <a href="Cascades%20%28ecoregion%29%23Cascade%20Crest%20Montane%20Forest%20%284c%29">Cascade Crest montane forest ecoregion</a>. Mountain hemlock trees dominate the forest in this area, while meadows sustain <a href="sedges">sedges</a>, <a href="dwarf%20willow">dwarf willow</a>s, <a href="tufted%20hairgrass">tufted hairgrass</a>, <a href="lupinus">lupine</a>, <a href="castilleja">red paintbrush</a>, and <a href="Newberry%20knotweed">Newberry knotweed</a>.

<a href="Tree%20line">Tree line</a> occurs at . The vegetation in this harsh <a href="alpine%20zone">alpine zone</a> consists of <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> and shrubby subalpine meadows. This zone has a large winter snowpack, with low temperatures for much of the year. There are patches of mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a> near the treeline, as well as wet meadows supporting <a href="Brewer%27s%20sedge">Brewer's sedge</a>, <a href="Holm%27s%20sedge">Holm's sedge</a>, <a href="black%20alpine%20sedge">black alpine sedge</a>, tufted hairgrass, and <a href="alpine%20aster">alpine aster</a>.

The Three Sisters area was occupied by <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a>s since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Northern Paiute</a> to the east and <a href="Molala">Molala</a> to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister.
The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer <a href="Peter%20Skene%20Ogden">Peter Skene Ogden</a> of the <a href="Hudson%20Bay%20Company">Hudson Bay Company</a> in 1825. He describes "a number of high mountains" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist <a href="David%20Douglas%20%28botanist%29">David Douglas</a> reported snow-covered peaks visible from the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, <a href="Euro-American">Euro-American</a>s approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as <a href="Nathaniel%20Jarvis%20Wyeth">Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth</a> in 1839 and <a href="John%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John Frémont</a> in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by <a href="John%20Strong%20Newberry">John Strong Newberry</a> in 1855 as part of the <a href="Pacific%20Railroad%20Surveys">Pacific Railroad Surveys</a>.

In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the <a href="Oregon%20Route%20242">McKenzie Pass Road</a> further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.

In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.

In 1892, President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the <a href="Forest%20Reserve%20Act%20of%201891">Forest Reserve Act of 1891</a>. Cascades Reserve was a strip of land from wide around the main crest of the Cascade Range, stretching from the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> almost to the border with <a href="California">California</a>. In 1905, administration of the Reserve was moved from the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a>. The Reserve was renamed the <a href="Cascade%20National%20Forest">Cascade National Forest</a> in 1907. In 1908, the forest was split: the eastern half became the Deschutes National Forest, while the western half merged in 1934 to form the Willamette National Forest.

Most of the Three Sisters glaciers were described for the first time by Ira A. Williams in 1916. Collier Glacier, between North and Middle Sister, was first studied and mapped by Edwin Hodge. Ruth Hopsen Keen took a forty-year photographic record of Collier Glacier, documenting part of the retreat of the glacier from 1910 to 1994.

In the 1930s, the Three Sisters were part of a proposed <a href="National%20Monument">National Monument</a>. To maintain its authority over the region, the Forest Service decided to create a primitive area in 1937. The following year, at the instigation of Forest Service employee <a href="Bob%20Marshall%20%28wilderness%20activist%29">Bob Marshall</a>, it was expanded by in the <a href="French%20Pete%20Creek">French Pete Creek</a> basin. In 1957, the Forest Service decided to reclassify the area as a wilderness area and removed the <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> of the French Pete Creek basin, despite protests of local environmental activists. The area became part of the <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">National Wilderness Preservation System</a> when the <a href="Wilderness%20Act%20of%201964">Wilderness Act of 1964</a> was passed, but the area still excluded the French Pete Creek basin. Responding to environmental mobilization throughout the state of Oregon, Congress passed the <a href="Endangered%20American%20Wilderness%20Act%20of%201978">Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978</a>, which led to the reinstatement of French Pete Creek and its surroundings in the Three Sisters Wilderness Area. The Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984 further expanded the wilderness with the addition of around Erma Bell Lakes.

The Three Sisters are a popular climbing destination for hikers and <a href="Mountaineering">mountaineers</a>.

Due to extensive erosion and rockfall, North Sister is the most dangerous climb of the three peaks, and is often informally called the "Beast of the Cascades". One of its peaks, Little Brother, can be safely <a href="scrambling">scrambled</a>. The first recorded ascent of North Sister was made in 1857 by six people, including Oregon politicians <a href="George%20Lemuel%20Woods">George Lemuel Woods</a> and <a href="James%20McBride%20%28politician%29">James McBride</a>, according to a story published in "<a href="Overland%20Monthly">Overland Monthly</a>" in 1870. Today, the common trail covers round-trip, gaining in elevation.

Middle Sister can also be scrambled, for a round-trip of and an elevation gain of .

The standard climbing route up the south ridge of South Sister runs for round-trip, rising from at the trailhead to at its summit..

The 2007 musical "<a href="Enchanted%20%28film%29">Enchanted</a>", in which Adams played a cheerful princess, was her first major success as a leading lady. She followed it by playing naïve, optimistic women in a series of films such as the 2008 drama "<a href="Doubt%20%282008%20film%29">Doubt</a>". She subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film "<a href="The%20Fighter">The Fighter</a>" (2010) and the psychological drama "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012). In 2013, she began portraying <a href="Lois%20Lane">Lois Lane</a> in superhero films set in the <a href="DC%20Extended%20Universe">DC Extended Universe</a>. She won two consecutive <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress</a> for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film "<a href="American%20Hustle">American Hustle</a>" (2013) and the troubled painter <a href="Margaret%20Keane">Margaret Keane</a> in the biopic "<a href="Big%20Eyes">Big Eyes</a>" (2014). Further acclaim came for playing a linguist in the science fiction film "<a href="Arrival%20%28film%29">Arrival</a>" (2016), a self-harming reporter in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> miniseries "<a href="Sharp%20Objects%20%28miniseries%29">Sharp Objects</a>" (2018), and <a href="Lynne%20Cheney">Lynne Cheney</a> in the satirical film "<a href="Vice%20%282018%20film%29">Vice</a>" (2018).

Adams's stage roles include <a href="the%20Public%20Theater">the Public Theater</a>'s revival of "<a href="Into%20the%20Woods">Into the Woods</a>" in 2012, in which she played the Baker's Wife. In 2014, she was named one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a> by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and featured in the <a href="Forbes%20Celebrity%20100">"Forbes" Celebrity 100</a> list. She is married to actor Darren Le Gallo, with whom she has a daughter.

Amy Lou Adams was born August 20, 1974, to American parents Richard and Kathryn Adams, when her father was stationed with the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> at the <a href="Caserma%20Ederle">Caserma Ederle</a> military complex in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, Italy. She is the middle of seven children, with four brothers and two sisters. After moving from one army base to another, Adams's family settled in <a href="Castle%20Rock%2C%20Colorado">Castle Rock, Colorado</a>, when she was eight. After leaving the army, her father sang professionally in nightclubs and restaurants. Adams has described going to her father's shows and drinking <a href="Shirley%20Temples">Shirley Temples</a> at the bar as among her fondest childhood memories. The family was poor; they camped and hiked together, and performed amateur skits usually written by her father and sometimes by her mother. Adams was enthusiastic about the plays and always played the lead.

Adams was raised as a <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">Mormon</a> until her parents divorced in 1985 and left the church. She did not have strong religious beliefs, but has said that she valued her upbringing for teaching her love and compassion. After the breakup, her father moved to Arizona and remarried, while the children remained with their mother. Her mother became a semi-professional <a href="Bodybuilding">bodybuilder</a> who took the children with her to the gym when she trained. Adams has compared her uninhibited early years with her siblings to "<a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Flies">Lord of the Flies</a>". Describing herself as a "scrappy, tough kid", she has said she fought frequently with other children.

Adams attended <a href="Douglas%20County%20High%20School%20%28Castle%20Rock%2C%20Colorado%29">Douglas County High School</a>. She was not academically inclined, but was interested in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. She competed in track and gymnastics, harbored ambitions of becoming a <a href="Ballet%20dancer">ballerina</a>, and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked high school and kept mostly to herself. After graduation, she and her mother moved to <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. She did not go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not pursuing higher education. At 18, Adams realized she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, and found musical theater more to her taste. One of her first stage roles was in a community theater production of "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>", which she did on a volunteer basis. To support herself, she worked as a greeter at a <a href="Gap%20%28clothing%20retailer%29">Gap</a> store. She also worked as a waitress at <a href="Hooters">Hooters</a>, where she had to wear tight outfits and deal with unruly customers. She left the job soon after she saved enough money to buy a used car.

Adams began her professional career as a dancer in a 1994 <a href="dinner%20theater">dinner theater</a> production of "<a href="A%20Chorus%20Line">A Chorus Line</a>" in <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a>. The job required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. She enjoyed singing and dancing, but disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, "I never really knew what the lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism." She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at <a href="Denver">Denver</a>'s <a href="Heritage%20Square%20%28Golden%2C%20Colorado%29">Heritage Square Music Hall</a> and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of "<a href="Anything%20Goes">Anything Goes</a>" at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and artistic director of the <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams moved to <a href="Chanhassen%2C%20Minnesota">Chanhassen, Minnesota</a>, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the "security and schedule" of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: "I had a lot of recurring injuries<a href="bursitis">bursitis</a> in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. My body was wearing out."

During her time at Chanhassen, Adams acted in her first filma black-and-white short satire named "The Chromium Hook". Soon after, while she was off work nursing a pulled muscle, she attended the locally held auditions for the Hollywood film "<a href="Drop%20Dead%20Gorgeous%20%28film%29">Drop Dead Gorgeous</a>" (1999), a satire on beauty pageants starring <a href="Kirsten%20Dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a>, <a href="Ellen%20Barkin">Ellen Barkin</a>, and <a href="Kirstie%20Alley">Kirstie Alley</a>. Adams was cast in the supporting part of a promiscuous cheerleader. She felt that her character's personality was far removed from her own and worried about how people would perceive her. The production was filmed locally, which enabled Adams to shoot for her role while also performing "<a href="Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a>" on stage. Encouragement from Alley prompted Adams to actively pursue a film career, and she moved to Los Angeles in January 1999. She described her initial experience in the city as "dark" and "bleak", and she pined for her life back in Chanhassen.

In Los Angeles, Adams auditioned for whatever parts came her way, but she was mostly given roles of "the bitchy girl". Her first assignment came within a week of her relocation in <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>'s television series "Manchester Prep", a spin-off of the film "<a href="Cruel%20Intentions">Cruel Intentions</a>", in the lead role of <a href="Kathryn%20Merteuil">Kathryn Merteuil</a> (played by <a href="Sarah%20Michelle%20Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> in the film). Following numerous script revisions and two production shutdowns, the series was canceled. Adams later said that a controversial scene in which her character encourages a girl to masturbate on a horse was the primary reason for its cancellation. The three filmed episodes were re-edited and released later in 2000 as the direct-to-video film "<a href="Cruel%20Intentions%202">Cruel Intentions 2</a>". Despite a negative critical reception, Nathan Rabin of <a href="the%20A.V.%20Club">the A.V. Club</a> wrote that Adams plays her "alpha-bitch role with vicious glee largely missing from Sarah Michelle Gellar's sterile take on the character".

Adams next had a supporting role as the teenage nemesis of a movie star (played by <a href="Kimberly%20Davies">Kimberly Davies</a>) in "<a href="Psycho%20Beach%20Party">Psycho Beach Party</a>" (2000), a horror parody of <a href="beach%20party%20film">beach party</a> and <a href="slasher%20films">slasher films</a>. She played the part as a homage to the actress <a href="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</a>. From 2000 to 2002, Adams appeared in guest roles in several television series, including "<a href="That%20%2770s%20Show">That '70s Show</a>", "<a href="Charmed">Charmed</a>", "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", "<a href="Smallville%20%28TV%20series%29">Smallville</a>," and "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>".

Following brief roles in three small-scale features of 2002"<a href="The%20Slaughter%20Rule">The Slaughter Rule</a>", "<a href="Pumpkin%20%28film%29">Pumpkin</a>", and "<a href="Serving%20Sara">Serving Sara</a>"Adams found her first high-profile part in <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Catch%20Me%20If%20You%20Can">Catch Me If You Can</a>". She was cast as Brenda Strong, a nurse with whom <a href="Frank%20Abagnale">Frank Abagnale, Jr.</a> (played by <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) falls in love. The film raised her confidence. Despite the film's success and praise for her "warm presence" from <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a>, a critic for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", it failed to launch her career. She was unemployed for a year after its release, leading her to almost quit film acting. Adams instead enrolled in acting classes, realizing that she had "a lot to learn and a lot of self-growth to work through". Her career prospects seemingly improved a year later when she received a lucrative offer to star as a regular in the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television drama "<a href="Dr.%20Vegas">Dr. Vegas</a>", but she was dropped after a few episodes. On film, she only had a minor role as the fiancée of <a href="Fred%20Savage">Fred Savage</a>'s character in the little-seen "<a href="The%20Last%20Run%20%282004%20film%29">The Last Run</a>" (2004).

Disillusioned by her firing from "Dr. Vegas", Adams, at 30 years old, considered looking for an alternative career after finishing work on the sole project she was signed to. It was the independent comedy-drama "<a href="Junebug%20%28film%29">Junebug</a>", which had a production budget of under $1 million. Directed by <a href="Phil%20Morrison%20%28director%29">Phil Morrison</a>, the film featured Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman. Morrison was impressed by Adams's ability to not question her character's inherently good motives. She found a connection with Johnsten's faith in God, and spent time with Morrison in <a href="Winston-Salem%2C%20North%20Carolina">Winston-Salem, North Carolina</a> (where the film is set), attending church. She described making the film as "the summer I grew into myself", and after dyeing her hair red for the part, she decided to not go back to her natural blonde color. "Junebug" premiered at the 2005 <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>, where Adams won a special jury prize. Tim Robey of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" labeled the film a "small, quiet miracle" and wrote that Adams had given "one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been my pleasure to review". Ann Hornaday of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" opined that her "radiant portrayal" reflected the film's "deeply humanist heart". Adams received her first <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination, for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>, and won an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Independent Spirit Award</a>.

Later in 2005, Adams had supporting parts in two critically panned filmsthe romantic comedy "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Date">The Wedding Date</a>", starring <a href="Debra%20Messing">Debra Messing</a> and <a href="Dermot%20Mulroney">Dermot Mulroney</a>, and the ensemble coming-of-age film "<a href="Standing%20Still%20%28film%29">Standing Still</a>". Also that year, she joined the cast of the television series "<a href="The%20Office%20%28US%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>", for a recurring role over three episodes. In "", a sports comedy from <a href="Adam%20McKay">Adam McKay</a>, Adams played the romantic interest of <a href="Will%20Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a>'s character, which critic <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> deemed "quite a comedown" from her role in "Junebug". She also had a minor role in the workplace comedy "<a href="The%20Ex%20%282006%20film%29">The Ex</a>", starring <a href="Zach%20Braff">Zach Braff</a> and <a href="Amanda%20Peet">Amanda Peet</a>.

After voicing in <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a>' animated comedy film "<a href="Underdog%20%282007%20film%29">Underdog</a>" (2007), Adams starred as a highly optimistic and joyous <a href="Disney%20Princess">Disney Princess</a> named Giselle in the musical romantic comedy "<a href="Enchanted%20%28film%29">Enchanted</a>". She was among 250 actresses who auditioned for the high-profile part; the studio favored the casting of a bigger star, but the director <a href="Kevin%20Lima">Kevin Lima</a> insisted on Adams due to her commitment to the part and her ability to not be judgmental about her character's personality. <a href="Patrick%20Dempsey">Patrick Dempsey</a> and <a href="James%20Marsden">James Marsden</a> featured as her romantic interests. A <a href="ballgown">ballgown</a> that she had to wear for the film weighed 45 pounds, and Adams fell several times under its weight. She also sang three songs for the film's <a href="Enchanted%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a>"True Love's Kiss", "<a href="Happy%20Working%20Song">Happy Working Song</a>", and "<a href="That%27s%20How%20You%20Know%20%28Disney%20song%29">That's How You Know</a>". The critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> commended Adams for being "fresh and winning" in a role that "absolutely depends on effortless lovability", and <a href="Wesley%20Morris">Wesley Morris</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote that she "demonstrates a real performer's ingenuity for comic timing and physical eloquence". Todd McCarthy considered the role to be Adams's breakthrough and compared her rise to stardom to that of <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>. "Enchanted" was a commercial success, grossing over $340 million worldwide. Adams received a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical</a>.

Following the success of "Enchanted", Adams took on the part of Bonnie Bach, Congressman <a href="Charlie%20Wilson%20%28Texas%20politician%29">Charlie Wilson</a>'s assistant in <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>' political comedy-drama "<a href="Charlie%20Wilson%27s%20War%20%28film%29">Charlie Wilson's War</a>" (2007), starring <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>, and <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>. Kirk Honeycutt of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" praised Adams for being "sweetly savvy" in her part, but <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> was disappointed to see her talent wasted in a role he considered to be of minimal importance.

The <a href="2008%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2008 Sundance Film Festival</a> saw the release of "<a href="Sunshine%20Cleaning">Sunshine Cleaning</a>", a comedy-drama about two sisters (played by Adams and <a href="Emily%20Blunt">Emily Blunt</a>) who start a crime scene clean-up business. Adams was attracted to the idea of playing someone who constantly tries to better herself. <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" considered Adams to be "magical", adding that she "gives us a portrait of raging want beneath a veneer of surface diffidence". In the 1939-set screwball comedy "<a href="Miss%20Pettigrew%20Lives%20for%20a%20Day">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</a>", Adams starred as an aspiring American actress in London who encounters a middle-aged governess named Miss Pettigrew (played by <a href="Frances%20McDormand">Frances McDormand</a>). <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" drew similarities to her role in "Enchanted" and wrote that the "screen magic" she displays in such endearing roles "hasn't been this intense since the heyday of <a href="Jean%20Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>".

Adams next starred in "<a href="Doubt%20%282008%20film%29">Doubt</a>", an adaptation of <a href="John%20Patrick%20Shanley">John Patrick Shanley</a>'s play of the . The production tells the story of a Catholic school principal (played by <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>) who accuses a priest (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) of <a href="pedophilia">pedophilia</a>; Adams features as an innocent nun embroiled in the conflict. Shanley initially approached <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a> for the part, but offered Adams the role after finding her innocent, yet intelligent, persona similar to that of <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>. Adams identified with her character's ability to find the best in people; she described her collaboration with Streep and Hoffman as a "master class" in acting. Writing for the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>", Amy Biancolli commented that Adams "sparks with distressed compassion", and Ann Hornaday opined that she "exudes just the right wide-eyed innocence". Adams was nominated for an Academy Award, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe Award</a>, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Supporting Actress.

As with "Junebug" and "Enchanted", Adams's roles in her three 2008 releases were those of the ingénueinnocent women with a cheerful personality. When asked about her being <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> in such roles, Adams said that she responds to characters who are joyful and identified with their sense of hope. She believed that despite certain similarities in their disposition, these characters were vastly different from one another; she said, "Naïveté is not stupidity, and innocent people are often very complex."

The 2009 fantasy adventure film "", starring <a href="Ben%20Stiller">Ben Stiller</a>, featured Adams as the aviator <a href="Amelia%20Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a>. It was the first motion picture to film inside the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> in Washington. The director <a href="Shawn%20Levy">Shawn Levy</a> said that the role allowed Adams to showcase her acting range; Adams believed it to be the first time she was allowed to play a confident character on screen. Despite mixed reviews, Adams's work was praised. Terming her "a sparkling screen presence", <a href="Michael%20Phillips%20%28critic%29">Michael Phillips</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" thought that the film "radically improves whenever Amy Adams pops up". That same year, Adams starred in the comedy-drama "<a href="Julie%20%26amp%3B%20Julia">Julie & Julia</a>" as disgruntled government secretary <a href="Julie%20Powell">Julie Powell</a> who decides to blog about the recipes in <a href="Julia%20Child">Julia Child</a>'s cookbook "<a href="Mastering%20the%20Art%20of%20French%20Cooking">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>"; in a parallel storyline, Meryl Streep portrays Child. Adams enrolled at the <a href="Institute%20of%20Culinary%20Education">Institute of Culinary Education</a> to prepare for the part. Carrie RicKey of "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" thought that the film was "as delicious as French cuisine" and found Adams to be "at her most winsome". Both "Night at the Museum" and "Julie & Julia" were commercial successes, with the former earning over $400 million.

Adams began the new decade with a leading role opposite <a href="Matthew%20Goode">Matthew Goode</a> in the romantic comedy "<a href="Leap%20Year%20%282010%20film%29">Leap Year</a>" (2010), which the critic <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> believed was saved from "truly awful status" by Adams's presence. Her next release of the yearthe boxing drama "<a href="The%20Fighter">The Fighter</a>"was much better received. Directed by <a href="David%20O.%20Russell">David O. Russell</a>, the film tells the story of boxer half-brothers <a href="Micky%20Ward">Micky Ward</a> and <a href="Dicky%20Eklund">Dicky Eklund</a> (played by <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a> and <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a>, respectively); <a href="Melissa%20Leo">Melissa Leo</a> played their mother and Adams portrayed Ward's aggressive girlfriend, a barmaid named Charlene Fleming. Describing Adams's part as a "tough, sexy bitch", Russell cast her against type to rid her of her girl-next-door image. The role marked a significant departure for her, and she was challenged by Russell's insistence on finding her character's strength in silence. She enrolled in an exotic dance class by the trainer <a href="Sheila%20Kelley%20%28American%20actress%29">Sheila Kelley</a> to find her character's eroticism. <a href="Joe%20Morgenstern">Joe Morgenstern</a> of "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" wrote that she is "as tough, tender, smart, and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in "Enchanted". What an actress, and what range!" She received Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actress; she lost the former two to Leo. She expressed a desire to play more dramatic roles in the future.

The Disney musical "<a href="The%20Muppets%20%28film%29">The Muppets</a>" (2011) starring the eponymous <a href="The%20Muppets">puppets</a> featured Adams and <a href="Jason%20Segel">Jason Segel</a> in live-action roles. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Lisa Schwarzbaum remarked that the role marked her return to her "comedian-sweetheart" persona. She also recorded seven songs for the film's <a href="The%20Muppets%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a>. The following year, Adams played the Baker's Wife in <a href="the%20Public%20Theater">the Public Theater</a>'s revival of <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>'s musical "<a href="Into%20the%20Woods">Into the Woods</a>", as part of the <a href="Shakespeare%20in%20the%20Park%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Shakespeare in the Park</a> festival at the open-air <a href="Delacorte%20Theater">Delacorte Theater</a>. It was her New York stage debut and her first theater appearance in 13 years. She agreed to the month-long production to "take on a challenge that seemed insurmountable", though she was overwhelmed and intimidated by it. She prepared with a private singing coach, but her film schedule enabled her to spend only four weeks in rehearsal. <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a>, "The New York Times" theater critic, praised Adams's "lucidly spoken and sung performance" but criticized her for lacking "the nervy, dissatisfied restlessness" of her part.

Adams took another "fierce woman" part in <a href="Paul%20Thomas%20Anderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>'s psychological drama "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012). She played Peggy Dodd, the ruthless and manipulative wife of the leader of a cult (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). It marked her third and final collaboration with Hoffman, whom she deeply admired, before his death two years later. The organization depicted in the film was deemed by journalists to be based on <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>; Adams considered the comparison to be misleading but was glad for the attention it brought to the film. Although not a <a href="method%20actor">method actor</a>, Adams believed that the intense role had left her on edge in her personal life. Comparing her character to <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>, the critic <a href="Justin%20Chang">Justin Chang</a> wrote that Adams's "pertness has rarely seemed so malevolent", and Donald Clarke of "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" commended her for playing the part with "discrete menace". John Patterson of "The Guardian" noted that a scene in which she chastises Hoffman's character while furiously masturbating him was one of the most significant sequences in the film. Once again, Adams received Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations for her supporting part.

<a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>'s sports drama "<a href="Trouble%20with%20the%20Curve">Trouble with the Curve</a>", in which she played the estranged daughter of a <a href="baseball%20scout">baseball scout</a> (Eastwood), was Adams's second film release of 2012. She admired Eastwood's "warm and generous" personality and was pleased with the collaboration. She prepared for the part by learning to catch, pitch, and swing from a baseball coach. The film received mixed reviews, and Roger Ebert took note of how Adams had made a standard role seem valuable. She also played the brief part of a drug addict in "<a href="On%20the%20Road%20%282012%20film%29">On the Road</a>", an ensemble drama based on <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>'s novel of the <a href="On%20the%20Road">same name</a>.

After losing out on the role of <a href="Lois%20Lane">Lois Lane</a> in two previous films about <a href="Superman">Superman</a>, Adams secured the part in <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a>'s 2013 reboot, "<a href="Man%20of%20Steel%20%28film%29">Man of Steel</a>", starring <a href="Henry%20Cavill">Henry Cavill</a> as the titular superhero. She played Lane with a mixture of toughness and vulnerability, but Peter Bradshaw thought that the character was "sketchily conceived" and criticized her lack of chemistry with Cavill. The film earned over $660 million to become one of her biggest box-office hits. Adams next featured in "<a href="Her%20%28film%29">Her</a>", a drama from the writer-director <a href="Spike%20Jonze">Spike Jonze</a> about a lonely man (<a href="Joaquin%20Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>) who falls in love with an operating system (voiced by <a href="Scarlett%20Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>); Adams played his close friend. She had unsuccessfully auditioned for Jonze's 2009 film "<a href="Where%20the%20Wild%20Things%20Are%20%28film%29">Where the Wild Things Are</a>" and was hired for "Her" after Jonze looked back at those tapes. Adams was drawn to the idea of portraying a platonic male-female friendship, which she believed was rare in film.

Further success came to Adams when she reteamed with David O. Russell in the crime film "<a href="American%20Hustle">American Hustle</a>", co-starring Christian Bale, <a href="Bradley%20Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>, and <a href="Jennifer%20Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a>. Inspired by the 1970s <a href="Abscam">Abscam</a> scandal, the film featured Adams as a seductive con artist, though she played it so that "everything felt justified and it didn't feel like she was just a sexy sociopath". She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for a scene in which she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The work was grueling for Adams, who later confirmed reports that Russell had been hard on her and had made her cry frequently; she said that she feared bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter. "American Hustle" was acclaimed by critics; <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of "The New York Times" believed that Adams "goes deeper here than she's ever been allowed to" and wrote that she had successfully "turn[ed] an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one". She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received her fifth Oscar nomination (her first for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>). "Her" and "American Hustle" were deemed by critics to be among the best films of 2013, and they were both nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>.

Following an appearance in the poorly received drama "<a href="Lullaby%20%282014%20film%29">Lullaby</a>", Adams starred in "<a href="Big%20Eyes">Big Eyes</a>" (2014), a biopic of the troubled artist <a href="Margaret%20Keane">Margaret Keane</a>, whose paintings of "big-eyed waifs" were plagiarized by her husband <a href="Walter%20Keane">Walter Keane</a>. When she was first offered the part, she passed on it to avoid playing another naïve woman. The birth of her daughter in 2010 prompted Adams to find strength in the passive character, and she drew upon experiences in her life where she had not stood up for herself. In preparation, she practiced painting and studied the way Keane worked. Keane liked Adams's portrayal of her, and <a href="Mark%20Kermode">Mark Kermode</a> of "The Guardian" termed her performance a "potent blend of intuitive fire and sensitive vulnerability". She won a second consecutive Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.

After a one-year absence from the screen, Adams had three film releases in 2016. She first reprised the role of Lois Lane in "", which marked the second installment in the <a href="DC%20Extended%20Universe">DC Extended Universe</a> after "Man of Steel". Despite a negative critical reception for favoring visual effects over a coherent narrative, the film earned over $870 million to rank as her highest-grossing release. In her next two releasesthe science fiction film "<a href="Arrival%20%28film%29">Arrival</a>" and the psychological thriller "<a href="Nocturnal%20Animals">Nocturnal Animals</a>"Adams played "emotionally guarded, fiercely intelligent" women to positive reviews. Based on <a href="Austin%20Wright">Austin Wright</a>'s novel "<a href="Tony%20and%20Susan">Tony and Susan</a>", <a href="Tom%20Ford">Tom Ford</a>'s "Nocturnal Animals" tells the story of an unhappily married art dealer named Susan (played by Adams), who is traumatized when reading a violent novel written by her ex-husband (played by <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>). Adams found little resemblance between herself and her "poised" and "aloof" character, and modeled Susan's personality on that of Ford. <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" considered the film to be visually arresting, yet thematically weak, but praised Adams and Gyllenhaal for making their character's pain seem genuine.

"Arrival", directed by <a href="Denis%20Villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a> and based on <a href="Ted%20Chiang">Ted Chiang</a>'s short story "<a href="Story%20of%20Your%20Life">Story of Your Life</a>", ranks among the most acclaimed films of Adams's career. The film is about Louise Banks, a linguist (played by Adams), who experiences strange visions when she is hired by the American government to interpret the language of extraterrestrials. She was drawn to the idea of playing an intellectual female lead and connected with the film's theme of unity and compassion. She watched documentaries on linguistics to prepare for the part. Writing for "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", Christoper Orr deemed Adams's performance to be "mesmerizingly open, by turns uplifting and sorrowful", and <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" believed that the film was a "showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve". "Arrival" was a commercial success, earning over $200 million against a $47 million budget. Adams received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations in the Best Actress category. Several journalists expressed disappointment over her failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it. Adams played Lois Lane for the third time in "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28film%29">Justice League</a>" (2017), an ensemble film about the <a href="Justice%20League">titular superheroes</a>. The critic Tim Grierson of "<a href="Screen%20International">Screen International</a>" commented that despite providing "emotional resonance" to the film, Adams's talents were wasted in a thankless supporting role.

Adams returned to television in 2018 with "<a href="Sharp%20Objects%20%28miniseries%29">Sharp Objects</a>", an <a href="HBO">HBO</a> miniseries based on <a href="Gillian%20Flynn">Gillian Flynn</a>'s thriller <a href="Sharp%20Objects">novel of the same name</a>. She served as an executive producer and starred as Camille Preaker, a <a href="self-harm">self-harm</a>ing reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the murder of two young girls. For the part, Adams gained weight and had to undergo three hours of <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">prosthetic makeup</a> to create her character's scarred body. The dysfunctional role proved challenging for her; she found it difficult to distance herself from it and suffered from insomnia. She read "<a href="A%20Bright%20Red%20Scream">A Bright Red Scream</a>" to learn about self-mutilation and researched the psychological condition of <a href="Munchausen%20syndrome%20by%20proxy">Munchausen syndrome by proxy</a>. The series and Adams's performance received positive reviews. <a href="James%20Poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a> praised the complex characterization of Preaker and called Adams's performance "transfixing". Daniel D'Addario of "Variety" found her to be "operating at the peak of her abilities" and added that with "her voice dropped an octave, slowed to a drawl, and sharpened with distrust, [she] is simply superb".

Adams and Christian Bale teamed for the third time in Adam McKay's political satire "<a href="Vice%20%282018%20film%29">Vice</a>" (2018), in which they portrayed former <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a>, <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>, and his wife, <a href="Lynne%20Cheney">Lynne</a>, respectively. She read Lynne's books to prepare; despite disagreeing with her political views, Adams approached the part with empathy and found a connection with her character's fortitude. "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>"s Richard Lawson drew comparisons with Adams's role in "The Master"; he commended "her usual rigor" but criticized the "lazy rubber-stamp of a man's idea of a woman adjacent to power". Eric Kohn of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> was more appreciative of her for "embodying an underwritten Lady Macbeth with ferocious energy". Adams earned Golden Globe nominations for her performances in both "Sharp Objects" and "Vice", and for the latter, she received her sixth Oscar and seventh BAFTA nomination.

In 2019, Adams will star as an agoraphobic woman who witnesses a murder in <a href="Joe%20Wright">Joe Wright</a>'s "<a href="The%20Woman%20in%20the%20Window%20%282019%20film%29">The Woman in the Window</a>", based on the mystery <a href="The%20Woman%20in%20the%20Window%20%28book%29">novel of the same name</a>. She will then reprise the role of Giselle in "Disenchanted", a sequel to "Enchanted". Adams will also launch her own production company, named Bond Group Entertainment, under which she will develop an adaptation of <a href="Barbara%20Kingsolver">Barbara Kingsolver</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Poisonwood%20Bible">The Poisonwood Bible</a>" for HBO.

Adams met the actor and painter Darren Le Gallo at an acting class in 2001, and they began dating a year later while collaborating on a short film named "Pennies". They became engaged in 2008, and she gave birth to their daughter in May 2010. Seven years after their engagement, the couple married in a private ceremony at a ranch near <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara, California</a>. Adams said in 2016 that she appreciates the numerous sacrifices Le Gallo had made as the primary caregiver for their family. They live in <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>. Adams has described her family life as "pretty low-key", and has said that her routine involves going to work, taking her daughter to the park, and having weekly date nights with her husband.

Adams finds little value in celebrity, and maintains that the "more that people know about me, the less they'll believe me and my characters". She attracts little gossip or tabloid attention, and strives to keep a healthy work-life balance. Adams makes an effort to remain unaffected by her fame, believing that it would hinder her ability to play roles with honesty. She has spoken about suffering from insecurity and lack of confidence from a young age and about how motherhood had made her calmer. She frequently breaks into song when stressed at work. Adams has joined other actors in calling for equal pay for women in the film industry, but she finds that actresses are too often asked to explain the <a href="gender%20pay%20gap">gender pay gap</a> and feels the questions should be directed instead to producers.

Having experienced difficulty in her early years in the film industry, Adams works closely with underprivileged students at New York City's Ghetto Film School. "Variety" honored her for her work with them in 2010. She supports <a href="the%20Trevor%20Project">the Trevor Project</a>, a nonprofit organization that helps troubled <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> teenagers, and served as a presenter for the 2011 event "Trevor Live". In 2013, she launched the book "The Beauty Book for Brain Cancer" to help raise money for brain cancer charities Snog and Headrush. The following year, she attended a charity event at the <a href="UCLA%20Medical%20Center%2C%20Santa%20Monica">UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica</a>, to raise funds for sexually abused children.

Writing for "The Guardian", Hadley Freeman has described Adams's personality as "extremely engaging, serious but with a hint of a straight-talking broad once she gets going". Carl Swanson of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine has called her "suspiciously unnarcissistic for a Hollywood star, gracious, hardworking, and decent to the point of almost not being a "celebrity"". Alex Bilmes of "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" wrote that her ability to be "both glamorous movie star and relatable normal person is key to her success".

Adams works closely with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits him for helping her organize and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method Loughlin teaches, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back story from the age of three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn to both leading and supporting parts. She has described herself as an obsessive performer.

Jake Coyle of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" considers Adams an actress who does not transform herself for her roles, but who inhabits "a character with warmth and smarts while, to varying degrees, remaining herself". Meryl Streep, her co-star in "Doubt" and "Julie & Julia", has said that Adams comes highly prepared on set and possesses "a gigantic intelligence" in developing her character's arc. Paul Thomas Anderson, her director in "The Master", has praised her dedication and investment in her projects. Journalists have commented on her "American sweetheart" persona in her roles in the 2000s while taking note of her increased versatility in the 2010s. In 2016, the novelist <a href="Stephen%20Marche">Stephen Marche</a> named Adams the greatest actress of her generation. Describing her film career in his 2016 review of "Arrival", the journalist and critic <a href="Anthony%20Lane">Anthony Lane</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" wrote:

"<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" reported Adams to be among the highest-paid actresses in the world, with earnings of over $13 million in 2014 and 2016, and over $11 million in 2017. The magazine featured her on its annual <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> list in 2014, and also ranked her among the most powerful actresses in the business. Also that year, she was named one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a> by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine. Adams received a <a href="List%20of%20actors%20with%20Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20motion%20picture%20stars">star</a> on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2017. By 2017, Adams's films had grossed over $4.7 billion worldwide. Robert Ito of "The New York Times" believes that Adams's propensity for risky projects prevents her from being a bigger box-office draw.

Stuart McGurk of "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" considers Adams's porcelain skin, auburn hair and her soft, earnest speaking style to be among her trademarks. She was named one of the most beautiful people in America by "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" in 2011, and several publications have featured her red carpet appearances in their listings of best-dressed celebrities. Adams advertised <a href="Lacoste">Lacoste</a>'s fragrance Eau de Lacoste in 2012, and two years later, she endorsed accessories and handbags of <a href="Max%20Mara">Max Mara</a>. In 2015, she collaborated with Max Mara to design and promote a line of handbags.

Adams's most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the online portal <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> and the review aggregate site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, include "<a href="Catch%20Me%20If%20You%20Can">Catch Me If You Can</a>" (2002), "<a href="Junebug%20%28film%29">Junebug</a>" (2005), "<a href="Enchanted%20%28film%29">Enchanted</a>" (2007), "<a href="Doubt%20%282008%20film%29">Doubt</a>" (2008), "" (2009), "<a href="Julie%20%26amp%3B%20Julia">Julie & Julia</a>" (2009), "<a href="The%20Fighter">The Fighter</a>" (2010), "<a href="The%20Muppets%20%28film%29">The Muppets</a>" (2011), "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012), "<a href="Man%20of%20Steel%20%28film%29">Man of Steel</a>" (2013), "<a href="Her%20%28film%29">Her</a>" (2013), "<a href="American%20Hustle">American Hustle</a>" (2013), "<a href="Big%20Eyes">Big Eyes</a>" (2014), "" (2016), "<a href="Arrival%20%28film%29">Arrival</a>" (2016), "<a href="Nocturnal%20Animals">Nocturnal Animals</a>" (2016), and "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28film%29">Justice League</a>" (2017). Among her television projects, she has starred in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> miniseries "<a href="Sharp%20Objects%20%28miniseries%29">Sharp Objects</a>" (2018). On stage, she has appeared in <a href="the%20Public%20Theater">the Public Theater</a>'s revival of "<a href="Into%20the%20Woods">Into the Woods</a>" in 2012.

Adams has been nominated for six <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for "Junebug" (2005), "Doubt" (2008), "The Fighter" (2010), "The Master" (2012), and "<a href="Vice%20%282018%20film%29">Vice</a>" (2018); and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for "American Hustle" (2013).

Fuck (film)

Fuck (stylized as F★CK) is a 2005 American documentary film by director <a href="Steve%20Anderson%20%28director%29">Steve Anderson</a> about the word "<a href="fuck">fuck</a>". The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="censorship">censorship</a>. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film "<a href="Perversion%20for%20Profit">Perversion for Profit</a>". Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist <a href="Sam%20Donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian <a href="Billy%20Connolly">Billy Connolly</a> states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a> comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author <a href="Hunter%20S.%20Thompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist <a href="Reinhold%20Aman">Reinhold Aman</a>, journalism analyst <a href="David%20Shaw%20%28writer%29">David Shaw</a> and "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" editor <a href="Jesse%20Sheidlower">Jesse Sheidlower</a>, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor <a href="Geoffrey%20Nunberg">Geoffrey Nunberg</a> observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.

Anderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word "fuck" by comedian <a href="George%20Carlin">George Carlin</a>'s monologue "<a href="Seven%20dirty%20words">Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television</a>". He named the film "Fuck" despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator <a href="Bill%20Plympton">Bill Plympton</a> provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the <a href="AFI%20Film%20Festival">AFI Film Festival</a> on November 7, 2005, at <a href="ArcLight%20Hollywood">ArcLight Hollywood</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>.

"Fuck"'s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and the New York "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness – the word "fuck" is used 857 times in the film. In his 2009 book "", law professor <a href="Christopher%20M.%20Fairman">Christopher M. Fairman</a> called the movie "the most important film using 'fuck'". The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> said, "Ultimately, "Fuck" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay."

"Fuck" begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film "<a href="Perversion%20for%20Profit">Perversion for Profit</a>", followed by a clip from "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>" which states that the word can be used as a "sentence enhancer". The documentary includes commentary from film and television writers <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="Steven%20Bochco">Steven Bochco</a>; comedians <a href="Janeane%20Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href="Bill%20Maher">Bill Maher</a>, <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a> and <a href="Billy%20Connolly">Billy Connolly</a>; musicians <a href="Chuck%20D">Chuck D</a>, <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a> and <a href="Ice%20T">Ice T</a>; political commentators <a href="Alan%20Keyes">Alan Keyes</a> and <a href="Pat%20Boone">Pat Boone</a>; and journalists <a href="Michael%20Medved">Michael Medved</a> and <a href="Judith%20Martin">Judith Martin</a>. The word "fuck" is used 857 times during the film.
Scholarly analysis is provided by "<a href="Maledicta">Maledicta</a>" publisher <a href="Reinhold%20Aman">Reinhold Aman</a>, journalism analyst <a href="David%20Shaw%20%28writer%29">David Shaw</a> and "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" editor <a href="Jesse%20Sheidlower">Jesse Sheidlower</a>. Language professor <a href="Geoffrey%20Nunberg">Geoffrey Nunberg</a> says, "You could think of that [word] as standing in for most of the changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones".

The film next features author <a href="Hunter%20S.%20Thompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> in his final documented interview. "Fuck" later includes archival footage of comedians <a href="Lenny%20Bruce">Lenny Bruce</a> and <a href="George%20Carlin">George Carlin</a>, and analysis of the word's use in popular culture, from "<a href="MASH%20%28film%29">MASH</a>" (1970) to "<a href="Scarface%20%281983%20film%29">Scarface</a>" (1983) and "<a href="Clerks">Clerks</a>" (1994). Carlin's 1972 monologue "<a href="Seven%20dirty%20words">Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television</a>" is excerpted in the film. Journalist <a href="Sam%20Donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> comments on the versatility of "fuck": "It's one of those all-purpose words." Bill Maher comments, "It's the ultimate bad word", observing that thanks to Lenny Bruce, <a href="comedy%20club">comedy club</a>s have become "the freest free-speech zone" in the United States.

Connolly states that "fuck" "sounds exactly like what it is", noting that the emotional impact of saying "fuck off" cannot be translated. He says that if you are in <a href="Lhasa%20Gonggar%20Airport">Lhasa airport</a> and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling "fuck off" will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, "The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it." Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host <a href="Dennis%20Prager">Dennis Prager</a> says that it is acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word "fuck" use an argument commonly known as "<a href="Think%20of%20the%20children">Think of the children</a>".

"Fuck" observes that the original use of the word is unknown to scholars, noting that its earliest written appearance was in the 1475 poem "<a href="Flen%20flyys">Flen flyys</a>". It was not, as is often claimed, originally an <a href="acronym">acronym</a> for "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" or "Fornication Under Consent of the King". The word has been used by authors including <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a>, <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> (in his 1928 "<a href="Lady%20Chatterley%27s%20Lover">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a>") and <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>. The film explains that "fuck" established its current usage during the First and Second World Wars, and was used by General <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a> in a speech to his forces who were about to enter France.

"Fuck" states that the first use of the word in a large-studio film was in "M*A*S*H" (1970), and it entered the "Oxford English Dictionary" in 1972. That year, the word was also recorded during the <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a> United States mission to <a href="Moon%20landing">land on the Moon</a>. The film includes a segment from the 1987 film "<a href="Planes%2C%20Trains%20and%20Automobiles">Planes, Trains and Automobiles</a>" with actor <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a>, in which "fuck" is repeated for comedic effect. "Fuck" states that the most financially successful <a href="live%20action">live action</a> comedy film to date had the suggestive title of "<a href="Meet%20the%20Fockers">Meet the Fockers</a>" (2004). The director analyzes the uses and connotations of "fuck" and the feelings it evokes on several levels. Bruce is quoted as saying, "If you can't say 'fuck', you can't say 'fuck the government'". Steve Anderson argues that "fuck" is an integral part of societal discussions about <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="censorship">censorship</a>.

"Fuck" includes songs with similarly themed titles, including "<a href="Shut%20Up%20and%20Fuck">Shut Up and Fuck</a>" by American <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> band <a href="Betty%20Blowtorch">Betty Blowtorch</a>, "Fucking Fucking Fuck" by Splatpattern and "<a href="I%20Love%20to%20Say%20Fuck">I Love to Say Fuck</a>" by American <a href="horror%20punk">horror punk</a> supergroup <a href="Murderdolls">Murderdolls</a>. Journalist Sam Peczek of "Culture Wars" compared the film's music to that in <a href="softcore%20pornography">softcore pornography</a>, and observed that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.

Anderson made his directorial debut in 2003 with the film "<a href="The%20Big%20Empty%20%282003%20film%29">The Big Empty</a>", starring actors <a href="Daryl%20Hannah">Daryl Hannah</a> and <a href="Jon%20Favreau">Jon Favreau</a>, and became fascinated by the usage of the word "fuck". In an interview with the "<a href="Democrat%20and%20Chronicle">Democrat and Chronicle</a>", Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production. He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer. Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word "fuck" came from "<a href="Class%20Clown">Class Clown</a>" by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".

The director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word "fuck" because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word "fuck", and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture. He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.

Anderson explained to the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" the confusing, forbidden nature of the word "fuck" in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it. He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself. In an interview with the "<a href="South%20China%20Morning%20Post">South China Morning Post</a>", Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.

The director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, <a href="sexual%20slang">sexual slang</a> and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>", and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.

Anderson stated in an interview with <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost. He classified the word "fuck" as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech. He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than "fuck", but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue. Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty. During production, "Fuck" was known as "The Untitled F-Word Film".

In an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film "Fuck" instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it "Fuck", because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "Los Angeles Times" (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in <a href="alternative%20newspaper">alternative newspaper</a>s such as "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>". Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre <a href="Marquee%20%28sign%29">marquees</a>.

Anderson explained that although the title of his documentary was "Fuck", he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as "Fuck", including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep "Fuck" as its title.

The film features animation by American graphic designer and cartoonist <a href="Bill%20Plympton">Bill Plympton</a>. To illustrate key concepts, "Fuck" uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two films in the documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear to be talking to each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a>.

<a href="Rainstorm%20Entertainment">Rainstorm Entertainment</a> was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004. The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel, and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi. Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>.
Thirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, "The Big Empty", and had industry credibility as executive producer of "<a href="Napoleon%20Dynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a>". Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on "Fuck". After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on "Fuck", it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.

Distribution rights to "Fuck" were obtained by <a href="THINKFilm">THINKFilm</a> in 2006. Movie chains did not use the film's title in their promotion, instead using references such as "The Four-Letter Word Film". Mark Urman, chief of the theatrical division of THINKFilm, told "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" that it was especially difficult (as an independent film distributor) to promote a film with a title media outlets did not wish to print. Urman told "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" that the intent of the production staff during promotion was a creative, original marketing campaign. THINKFilm marketed the documentary as a comprehensive, humorous look at the dichotomy between the taboo nature and cultural universality of the word "fuck".

"Fuck" was shown for the first time on November 7, 2005, at the <a href="AFI%20Film%20Festival">American Film Institute Film Festival</a> at the ArcLight Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. On March 10, 2006, interest increased after the opening night of the 20th <a href="South%20by%20Southwest%20Film%20Festival">South by Southwest Film Festival</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. At the 30th <a href="Cleveland%20International%20Film%20Festival">Cleveland International Film Festival</a>, it sold out two screenings (which were standing-room only events).

"Fuck" was featured on March 31 and April 2, 2006, at the <a href="Florida%20Film%20Festival">Florida Film Festival</a>. It was screened in April 2006 during the <a href="Philadelphia%20Film%20Festival">Philadelphia Film Festival</a> at <a href="Prince%20Music%20Theater">Prince Music Theater</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. It had its Washington, D.C. premiere in June 2006, and was shown on June 15 at the <a href="Nantucket%20Film%20Festival">Nantucket Film Festival</a>.

"Fuck" opened in Los Angeles on August 23, 2006 and in New York on November 10. It made its Canadian debut at the 2006 <a href="Hot%20Docs%20Canadian%20International%20Documentary%20Festival">Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival</a>, and began regular showings at the <a href="Bloor%20Cinema">Bloor Cinema</a> on December 1. The documentary began screening at the Century Centre Cinema in Chicago on November 17, 2006. "Fuck" had two screenings in April 2007 during the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20International%20Film%20Festival">Hong Kong International Film Festival</a> in <a href="Tsim%20Sha%20Tsui">Tsim Sha Tsui</a>. According to a 2011 interview with Anderson in the "<a href="Santa%20Barbara%20Independent">Santa Barbara Independent</a>", the documentary was shown in about 100 film festivals worldwide and was screened in about 65 cities during its theatrical release.

"Fuck" received mixed reviews. The <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported a 56% approval rating with an average rating of 5.8/10 based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "A documentary that sets out to explore a lingual taboo but can't escape its own naughty posturing." At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a weighted-mean rating from 0–100 based on reviews by film critics, the film has a rating score of 58 based on 23 reviews (a mixed, or average, film). The American Film Institute wrote, "Ultimately, "Fuck" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay".

Jack Garner of the "Democrat and Chronicle" gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, concluding that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite "Fuck"s repetitive use of the word. In "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of "<a href="Film%20Threat">Film Threat</a>" said that the crux of the film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> wrote in "The New York Times": "Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane". In the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>", Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.

In a review for "<a href="The%20Austin%20Chronicle">The Austin Chronicle</a>" Marjorie Baumgarten gave the film a rating of 4.5 out of five stars, concluding that it helped unravel myths surrounding the word and describing it as captivating and educational. Steve Schneider reviewed the film for the "<a href="Orlando%20Weekly">Orlando Weekly</a>", comparing it to an academic thesis despite its repeated use of <a href="off-color%20humor">off-color humor</a>. Noel Murray of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" gave the film a grade of B-minus, stating that "Fuck" succeeded where <a href="Kirby%20Dick">Kirby Dick</a>'s "<a href="This%20Film%20Is%20Not%20Yet%20Rated">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>" did not, by providing viewpoints from multiple perspectives. Karl French wrote in a review for the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" that the documentary was unique and reasonably entertaining. Moira MacDonald asked, in a review for "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>", if viewers could embrace the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> and still be leery of the word's omnipresence in society. <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> wrote in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" that the commentators seemed monotonous and formulaic in debating freedom of speech, and criticized the film's repetition of the word "fuck".

Peter Keough reviewed the film for the "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">Boston Phoenix</a>"; giving it a rating of two out of four stars, he also said that the repeated use of "fuck" grew tiresome. In a critical review for "The Observer" Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious. Peter Bradshaw of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality. In a review for "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded; he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough. In "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out London</a>" David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship. A critical review by Noah Sanders of "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%28newspaper%29">The Stranger</a>" concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized. The "<a href="St.%20Paul%20Pioneer%20Press">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>" criticized the film's length, which was echoed by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>", "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Everett%29">The Herald</a>" and the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>". In a review for the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech. Mike Pinsky of "<a href="DVD%20Verdict">DVD Verdict</a>" concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved by the beginning of the documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.

THINKFilm reached an agreement to screen the documentary on the American <a href="Pay%20television">premium</a> cable channel <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20channel%29">Showtime</a> in 2007, and it aired on the <a href="Documentary%20Channel%20%28TV%20channel%29">Documentary Channel</a> on May 28, 2011. The <a href="DVD">DVD</a> for "Fuck" was released by THINKFilm on February 13, 2007, and a United Kingdom DVD edition was released in 2009. For the DVDs, THINKFilm remastered the video for "Fuck"; it was optimized for home viewing with 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer to a 16:9 anamorphic full-frame presentation and Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 audio.

Trailers for "<a href="Shortbus">Shortbus</a>", "<a href="Farce%20of%20the%20Penguins">Farce of the Penguins</a>" and "<a href="The%20Aristocrats%20%28film%29">The Aristocrats</a>" appear on the DVD before the documentary. Special features include a <a href="Audio%20commentary">commentary track</a> by Steve Anderson, interviews with Anderson and Bill Plympton, the film's <a href="theatrical%20trailer">theatrical trailer</a>, a gallery for the introductory trailers, deleted scenes and interviews with Hunter S. Thompson and Tera Patrick. The disc includes an optional on-screen counter, giving viewers a running total of utterances (and appearances) of the word "fuck" during play.

"Fuck" has been a resource for several university courses. Christopher M. Fairman discussed the documentary in his article, "Fuck", published in February 2007 in the "<a href="Cardozo%20Law%20Review">Cardozo Law Review</a>". Fairman cited Anderson's decision to call his film "Fuck" and the marketing problems this entailed, saying that he and Anderson both found the title of their works helped spur debate on <a href="word%20taboo">word taboo</a>s in society.

In an interview with the "Santa Barbara Independent", Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students. The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class. Anderson said it was not the use of the word "fuck" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a "<a href="Fuck%20for%20Forest">Fuck for Forest</a>" concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy. The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at <a href="William%20Penn%20High%20School%20%28Philadelphia%29">William Penn High School</a> without previewing it or sending <a href="permission%20slip">permission slip</a>s home to parents. He told the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>" that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse. He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent. The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring. An analysis of the incident by the "Philadelphia Daily News" concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.

"Fuck" was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal "Communication Teacher", "Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth? "F*ck: A Documentary" and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom", by Miriam Sobre-Denton of <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University%20Carbondale">Southern Illinois University Carbondale</a> and Jana Simonis.

Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from <a href="Postgraduate%20education">graduate-level</a> classes in language and culture.

Luo Yixiu

Luo Yixiu (; 20 October 1889 – 11 February 1910), a <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> woman, was the first wife of the later Chinese <a href="communism">communist</a> revolutionary and political leader <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, to whom she was married from 1908 until her death. Coming from the area around <a href="Shaoshan">Shaoshan</a>, <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>, in south central China – the same region as Mao – her family were impoverished local landowners.

Most of what is known about their marriage comes from an account Mao gave to the American reporter <a href="Edgar%20Snow">Edgar Snow</a> in 1936, which Snow included in his book "<a href="Red%20Star%20Over%20China">Red Star Over China</a>". According to Mao, he and Luo Yixiu were the subject of an <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged marriage</a> organised by their respective fathers, <a href="Mao%20Yichang">Mao Yichang</a> and Luo Helou. Luo was eighteen and Mao just fourteen years old at the time of their betrothal. Although Mao took part in the wedding ceremony, he later stated that he was unhappy with the marriage, never consummating it and refusing to live with his wife. Socially disgraced, she lived with Mao's parents for two years until she died of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, while he moved out of the village to continue his studies elsewhere, eventually becoming a founding member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist Party of China</a>. Various biographers have suggested that Mao's experience of this marriage affected his later views, leading him to become a critic of arranged marriage and a vocal <a href="feminism">feminist</a>. He would marry three more times, to <a href="Yang%20Kaihui">Yang Kaihui</a>, <a href="He%20Zizhen">He Zizhen</a> and <a href="Jiang%20Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, the last of whom was better known as Madame Mao.

Born on 20 October 1889, Luo Yixiu was the eldest daughter of Luo Helou (; 1871–1943), a "shenshi" () or rural intellectual who earned his living as a farmer and his wife (1869–1912), whose surname was Mao and who was a distant great-aunt of Mao Zedong. Although historian <a href="Lee%20Feigon">Lee Feigon</a> stated that the Luo family was locally important, Mao biographers Alexander V. Pantsov and Steven I. Levine claimed that they had fallen into poverty. Luo Helou and his wife had five sons and five daughters, but seven of these children died, leaving them only three daughters. The couple's lack of adult sons diminished their social status, for in Chinese society at the time, only sons could continue the family lineage.

Mao Zedong had been born and raised at his father's farm in Shaoshanchong, a small rural village named for the nearby Shaoshan mountain. His disciplinarian father, <a href="Mao%20Yichang">Mao Yichang</a>, had decided to deal with Zedong's rebellious attitude in a manner typical of the time, by forcing him into an arranged marriage that would compel him to take family matters seriously. Yichang also desired a helper for his own wife, <a href="Wen%20Qimei">Wen Qimei</a>, whose health had deteriorated through years of heavy agricultural labour. He selected Luo Yixiu in either late 1907 or 1908. Her <a href="kinship">kinship</a> to the Maos may have helped in this selection, as Luo Yixiu's mother's four brothers, surnamed Mao, lived only two "<a href="li%20%28unit%29">li</a>" (1 km) from Mao Yichang's home in Shaoshanchong. Following traditional procedures, a matchmaker would have been sent to the Luo family house, and the Luo family would have been socially expected to accept the marriage proposal immediately. Luo Helou was happy to see his eldest daughter married. The two families exchanged gifts and signed the marriage contract, after which the marriage was considered inviolable.

Zedong first met Yixiu on the day that the contract was signed. Years later, his granddaughter Kong Dongmei stated that Mao was unhappy with his father's choice, and that he instead was in love with his cousin, Wang Shigu. However, marriage to Wang had been ruled out by a local <a href="divination">diviner</a> because their <a href="Chinese%20astrology">horoscope</a>s were incompatible. Although displeased by the arrangement, Mao agreed to marry Luo. At the time he was fourteen, and later erroneously informed <a href="Edgar%20Snow">Edgar Snow</a> that Luo was aged twenty, a claim independently accepted by Mao biographers <a href="Ross%20Terrill">Ross Terrill</a> and <a href="Philip%20Short">Philip Short</a>, but later challenged by biographers <a href="Jung%20Chang">Jung Chang</a> and <a href="Jon%20Halliday">Jon Halliday</a>, and Alexander V. Pantsov and Steven I. Levine, who established that she was eighteen.

The wedding took place in 1908. According to a number of Mao's biographers, the ceremony would have likely followed traditional rural Hunanese custom. Thus, it probably would have begun with a feast in the groom's home on the day before the ceremony, to which friends and relatives were invited. The next day, the bride would have been dressed in red, with a red veil over her face, and carried by red <a href="palanquin">palanquin</a> to the groom's family home. There, her veil would have been removed, and she would have been expected to express unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the groom by publicly insulting him. According to tradition, a display of <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> would probably have taken place, before both bride and groom would have <a href="kowtow">kowtow</a>ed to each guest, to the groom's <a href="Ancestor%20veneration%20in%20China">ancestral altar</a>, to the spirits, and to one another, concluding the ceremony.

If traditional practices were adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests would have given gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her <a href="hymen">hymen</a> had been broken during <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>, and that she had therefore been a virgin.

According to what he told Snow, Mao refused to live with his wife and claimed that they had never consummated their marriage. Soon after the wedding, he ran away from home to live with an unemployed student in Shaoshan. There he spent much of his time reading, particularly historical works like <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a>'s "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Records of the Grand Historian</a>" and <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a>'s "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Former%20Han%20Dynasty">History of the Former Han Dynasty</a>," and political tracts like <a href="Feng%20Guifen">Feng Guifen</a>'s "Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin".

Now considered part of the Mao family, Luo lived with Mao Yichang and Wen Qimei at their home, but was publicly humiliated by her husband's disappearance; some locals considered her to be Yichang's <a href="concubine">concubine</a>. Luo Yixiu died of dysentery on 11 February 1910, the day after <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">Chinese New Year</a>. Mao Zedong returned home; his father forgave him for his disobedience, and in the autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son's studies at the Dongshan Higher Primary School, and so Mao left Shaoshanchong. When in 1936 Mao told Snow "I do not consider her my wife", he made no mention of her death. Luo Yixiu's grave is located on the mountain facing Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshanchong, a few steps away from the tomb of his parents.

When Mao Zedong returned to Shaoshan in 1925 to organize a local peasant movement, he went to visit Luo Yixiu's relatives, including her father Luo Helou and his nephew Luo Shiquan (石泉). Luo Shiquan would join the Communist Party in the winter of that year and would remain a peasant activist until the <a href="Chinese%20Communist%20Revolution">1949 revolution</a>. Because Luo Yixiu had died without offspring, when the Mao lineage updated its <a href="genealogy%20book">genealogy book</a> in 1941, Mao Anlong (), who was Mao Zedong's third son with his second wife <a href="Yang%20Kaihui">Yang Kaihui</a>, was listed as Luo's descendant. In 1950, Mao sent his eldest son <a href="Mao%20Anying">Mao Anying</a> to Shaoshan and instructed him to visit Luo Shiquan. Mao also kept in contact with two men who had married Luo Yixiu's sisters, and met one of these men when he returned to Shaoshan in 1959 for the first time since the 1920s.

In "", American historian <a href="Lee%20Feigon">Lee Feigon</a> argued that Mao's experience with arranged marriage inspired him to become "a vehement advocate of women's rights" in the late 1910s, as he began to write articles for the left-wing press criticizing the traditional Chinese family system and arguing that love, rather than societal or family pressures, should be the primary determinant in marriage. This idea had previously been expressed by journalist and sinologist <a href="Clare%20Hollingworth">Clare Hollingworth</a>. In their biography "", <a href="Jung%20Chang">Jung Chang</a> and <a href="Jon%20Halliday">Jon Halliday</a> agreed, stating that it was this experience with Luo that turned Mao into a "fierce opponent" of arranged marriage.

Mao would marry three more women over the course of his life: <a href="Yang%20Kaihui">Yang Kaihui</a> in December 1920, <a href="He%20Zizhen">He Zizhen</a> in May 1928, and <a href="Jiang%20Qing">Jiang Qing</a> in November 1939.

The dates of his birth and death are unknown. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63 AD. In an agreement to resolve the <a href="Roman%E2%80%93Iranian%20relations%23Relations_during_the_Julio-Claudian_dynasty">Roman–Parthian conflict</a> in and over Armenia, Tiridates I (one of the brothers of <a href="Vologases%20I%20of%20Parthia">Vologases I of Parthia</a>) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a> in 66 AD; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a <a href="client%20state">client kingdom</a>, various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> ceded Armenia to the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>.

In addition to being a king, Tiridates I was also a <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian</a> priest and was accompanied by other <a href="magi">magi</a> on his journey to Rome in 66 AD. In the early 20th century, <a href="Franz%20Cumont">Franz Cumont</a> speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of <a href="Mithraism">Mithraism</a> which became the main religion of the Roman Army and spread across the whole empire. Furthermore, during his reign, he started reforming the administrative structure of Armenia, a reform which was continued by his successors, and which brought many <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a> customs and offices into it.

Tiridates I is one of the principal characters in <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s opera "<a href="Radamisto%20%28Handel%29">Radamisto</a>" and <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>'s opera "<a href="Octavia%20%28opera%29">Octavia</a>."

Tiridates I was one of the sons born to <a href="Vonones%20II">Vonones II</a>, king of <a href="Media%20Atropatene">Media Atropatene</a> and later king of <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>, by a Greek <a href="concubinage">concubine</a>. Virtually nothing is known about Tiridates' youth, which he spent in Media Atropatene. "Tiridates" means "given by Tir". Tir was the <a href="Armenian%20mythology">Armeno-Parthian god</a> of literature, science and art based on the <a href="Avesta">Avesta</a>n <a href="Tishtrya">Tishtrya</a> and fused with the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>.

In 51 AD the Roman <a href="Promagistrate">procurator</a> of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, Julius Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country, then under an <a href="Caucasian%20Iberia">Iberia</a>n usurper <a href="Rhadamistus">Rhadamistus</a>. Rhadamistus had killed his uncle <a href="Mithridates%20of%20Armenia">Mithridates</a>, the legitimate king of Armenia, by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of <a href="Garni">Gornea</a>.
Acting without instruction, Paelignus recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia. Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages, but he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia.
In 52 AD King <a href="Vologases%20I%20of%20Parthia">Vologases I of Parthia</a> took the opportunity to invade Armenia, conquering <a href="Artaxata">Artaxata</a> ("Artashat" in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates I as king. This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> and Parthian king <a href="Phraates%20IV">Phraates IV</a> which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia. Vologases I considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime. A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son <a href="Vardanes%20II">Vardanes</a> forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the prince Tiridates I in early 55. Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river <a href="Araxes">Araxes</a>. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates I received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy. Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father <a href="Pharasmanes%20I%20of%20Iberia">Pharasmanes I of Iberia</a> for having plotted against the royal power.

Unhappy with the growing <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>n influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Corbulo">Corbulo</a> with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings. A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given <a href="Lesser%20Armenia">Lesser Armenia</a> (<a href="Nicopolis">Nicopolis</a> and <a href="Satala">Satala</a>) and <a href="Sohaemus%20of%20Emesa">Sohaemus of Emesa</a> received <a href="Armenia%20Sophene">Armenia Sophene</a>. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20of%20Commagene">Antiochus IV of Commagene</a> attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates I sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the <a href="Mu%C5%A1ki">Moschoi</a> tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates I fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards <a href="Tigranocerta">Tigranocerta</a> through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault. By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome.

Nero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Cappadocia">kings of Cappadocia</a>, the grandson of <a href="Glaphyra">Glaphyra</a> (daughter of <a href="Archelaus%20of%20Cappadocia">Archelaus of Cappadocia</a>) and <a href="Alexander%2C%20son%20of%20Herod">Alexander</a> of <a href="Iudaea%20Province">Judea</a> (the brother of <a href="Herod%20Archelaus">Herod Archelaus</a> and the son of <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herod the Great</a>), who assumed the Armenian name <a href="Tigranes%20VI%20of%20Armenia">Tigranes</a> (his uncle was <a href="Tigranes%20V%20of%20Armenia">Tigranes V</a>). His son, named <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Alexander">Gaius Julius Alexander</a>, married <a href="Julia%20Iotapa%20%28daughter%20of%20Antiochus%20IV%29">Iotapa</a>, the daughter of <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20of%20Commagene">Antiochus IV of Commagene</a> and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country. Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including <a href="Polemon%20II%20of%20Pontus">Polemon</a>, Parasmanes, <a href="Aristobulus%20of%20Chalcis">Aristobolus</a> and Antiochus.

Vologases I was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the <a href="Hyrcania">Hyrcania</a>ns who were revolting. Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a> and deposed its King <a href="Monobaz%20II">Monobazes</a> in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians.
Vologases I considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates I to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of <a href="spahbod">spahbod</a> Moneses a well-disciplined force of <a href="cataphract">cataphract</a>s along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases I gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia. Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of <a href="Verulanus%20Severus">Verulanus Severus</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Vettius%20Bolanus">Marcus Vettius Bolanus</a> to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.

Moneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases I in Nisibis located from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases I agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace. Vologases I demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates I be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent <a href="Lucius%20Caesennius%20Paetus">Lucius Caesennius Paetus</a>, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.

Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rhandeia">Battle of Rhandeia</a> in 62, losing the legions of <a href="Legio%20XII%20Fulminata">XII "Fulminata"</a> commanded by <a href="Calvisius%20Sabinus">Calvisius Sabinus</a> and <a href="Legio%20IV%20Scythica">IV "Scythica"</a> commanded by <a href="Lucius%20Funisulanus%20Vettonianus">Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus</a>. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into <a href="Melitene">Melitene</a> and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law <a href="Lucius%20Annius%20Vinicianus%20%28son-in-law%20of%20Cn.%20Domitius%20Corbulo%29">Lucius Annius Vinicianus</a> to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.

Prior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates I visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his wife and children and two of his brothers. His escort included an imposing retinue, comprising many feudal lords, several sages, 3,000 Parthian horsemen, and also a large number of Romans. His route lay across <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, through <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>, on the eastern shores of the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> and <a href="Picenum">Picenum</a>, in northeastern Italy. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates I rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side. The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates I.

<a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>, a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates I favorably at the time of his arrival: "Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence." Nero greeted Tiridates I at Neapolis (<a href="Naples">Naples</a>) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. 

According to Dio's account, Tiridates I refused to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). Nero was reportedly so impressed by this act that he ordered a <a href="gladiatorial">gladiatorial</a> games be staged in honor of his guest at Puteolis (present day <a href="Pozzuoli">Pozzuoli</a>, near Naples). According to Cassius Dio, the Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. <a href="Ethiopian">Ethiopian</a> women, men and children fought as <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>s and <a href="gladiatrices">gladiatrices</a> at the games to impress the Armenian king.

The climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.
On the day after Tiridates I's arrival, Nero came to the <a href="Roman%20Forum">Forum</a> clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates I and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the <a href="dais">dais</a>, Tiridates I knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates I addressed the emperor:

To which Nero replied:

Tiridates I then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A <a href="Praetor">Praetor</a>, speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek. According to <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, Tiridates I then introduced Nero to magian feasts ("magicis cenis"). <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> claimed that Tiridates I was also interested in all things Roman.

Public festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the <a href="Theatre%20of%20Pompey">Theatre of Pompey</a> and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as "the Golden Day." Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a <a href="chariot%20race">chariot race</a>. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with <a href="zither">zither</a> accompaniment. Tiridates I was amazed and disgusted by Nero's extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master. He made no concealment of his views to Nero's face and said to him sarcastically: "Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo."

In memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of <a href="Imperator">Imperator</a>, or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates I and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates I of fifty million <a href="sesterces">sesterces</a>.

On his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates I viewed an exhibition of <a href="Pankration">pancratium</a>. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates I saw exclaimed: "That's an unfair contest. It isn't fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten."

Later, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases I to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: "It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other."

It has been suggested that the visit of Tiridates I, an event that greatly impressed contemporaries, was adapted by Christians to become the story of the adoration of the Christ Child by the <a href="Three%20Magi">Three Magi</a>. The Christian legend changed Rome into Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Ruler of the coming Kingdom of God, and replaced Tiridates I with that contemporary king who was already connected with Christianity through the <a href="Acts%20of%20St.%20Thomas">Acts of St. Thomas</a>: <a href="Gondophares">Gondophares</a>, otherwise known as Kaspar.

Peace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Janus%20%28Roman%20Forum%29">Temple of Janus</a>, which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates I returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor; he embellished the royal residence at <a href="Garni">Garni</a>, nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome. Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero's death and through the entire duration of <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>'s rule in the East. Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically. 

The immediate dividend of the peace was Rome's ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the <a href="First%20Jewish%E2%80%93Roman%20War">First Jewish–Roman War</a> just one year after Tiridates' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible. Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians. The name of <a href="Legio%20XII%20Fulminata">Legio XII Fulminata</a> discovered carved on a mountain in <a href="Gobustan%20National%20Park">Gobustan</a> (in modern <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription. The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> invaded Armenia in 114.

In 72 the <a href="Alans">Alans</a>, a warlike nomadic <a href="Sarmatian">Sarmatian</a> tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates I and his brother <a href="Pacorus%20II">Pacorus</a>, King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates I was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene. The King of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>, who helped reconstruct the fortress of <a href="Harmozica">Harmozica</a> around the Iberian capital <a href="Mtskheta">Mtskheta</a>, near modern <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>. An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates I also warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates I's reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor. It is known that Tiridates' nephew, Axidares, the son of Pacorus II of Parthia, was King of Armenia by 110.

<a href="Franz%20Cumont">Franz Cumont</a> in "Les Réligions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain" ("The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism") pointed out that Tiridates I was instrumental in the development of <a href="Mithraism">Mithraism</a> in Rome, which ultimately became the most dominant Roman religion throughout the empire.

Tiridates I is one of the principal characters in <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s opera "<a href="Radamisto%20%28Handel%29">Radamisto</a>" and <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>'s opera "<a href="Octavia%20%28opera%29">Octavia</a>."

Ambohimanga

Ambohimanga is a hill and traditional fortified royal settlement ("<a href="Rova%20%28Madagascar%29">rova</a>") in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, located approximately northeast of the capital city of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>. The hill and the rova that stands on top are considered the most significant symbol of the cultural identity of the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina people</a> and the most important and best-preserved monument of the precolonial <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Merina Kingdom</a>. The walled historic village includes residences and burial sites of several key monarchs. The site, one of the <a href="twelve%20sacred%20hills%20of%20Imerina">twelve sacred hills of Imerina</a>, is associated with strong feelings of national identity and has maintained its spiritual and sacred character both in ritual practice and the popular imagination for at least four hundred years. It remains a place of worship to which pilgrims come from Madagascar and elsewhere.

The site has been politically important since the early 18th century, when King <a href="Andriamasinavalona">Andriamasinavalona</a> (1675–1710) divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants and assigned his son <a href="Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana%20Andriandrazaka">Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana</a> to govern the northeastern quadrant, Avaradrano, from its newly designated capital at Ambohimanga. The division of Imerina led to 77 years of civil war, during which time the successive rulers of Avaradrano led military campaigns to expand their territory while undertaking modifications to the defenses at Ambohimanga to better protect it against attacks. The war was ended from Ambohimanga by King <a href="Andrianampoinimerina">Andrianampoinimerina</a>, who successfully undertook negotiations and military campaigns that reunited Imerina under his rule by 1793. Upon capturing the historic capital of Imerina at Antananarivo, Andrianampoinimerina shifted his royal court and all political functions back to its original locus at <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">Antananarivo's royal compound</a> and declared the two cities of equal importance, with Ambohimanga as the kingdom's spiritual capital. He and later rulers in his line continued to conduct royal rituals at the site and regularly inhabited and remodeled Ambohimanga until <a href="French%20Madagascar">French colonization</a> of the kingdom and the exile of the royal family in 1897. The significance of historical events here and the presence of royal tombs have given the hill a sacred character that is further enhanced at Ambohimanga by the burial sites of several <a href="Vazimba">Vazimba</a>, the island's earliest inhabitants.

The royal compound on the hilltop is surrounded by a complex system of defensive ditches and stone walls and is accessed by 14 gateways, of which many were sealed by stone disc barriers. The gateways and construction of buildings within the compound are arranged according to two overlaid cosmological systems that value the four cardinal points radiating from a unifying center, and attach sacred importance to the northeastern direction. The complex inside the wall is subdivided into three smaller rova. Mahandrihono, the largest compound, was established between 1710 and 1730 by King <a href="Andriambelomasina">Andriambelomasina</a>; it remains largely intact and contains the royal tombs, house of King Andrianampoinimerina, summer palace of Queen <a href="Ranavalona%20II">Ranavalona II</a>, and sites that figured in key royal rituals such as the sacrificial <a href="zebu">zebu</a> pen, <a href="fandroana">royal bath</a> and main courtyard. Original buildings no longer remain in the compound of Bevato, established before 1710 by Andriamborona, and the Nanjakana compound, built for King <a href="Andrianjafy">Andrianjafy</a> in the late 19th century. The hill and its royal fortified city were added to the list of <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s in 2001 and represent Madagascar's only cultural site following the destruction by fire in 1995 of its historic sister city, the <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">Rova of Antananarivo</a>, shortly before the latter's intended inscription to the list. Numerous governmental and civil society organizations support the conservation of Ambohimanga by restoring damaged features and preventing further degradation.

The name "Ambohimanga" is a noun-adjective compound in the standard <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a> composed of two parts: "ambohi", meaning "hill", and "manga", which can mean "sacred", "blue", "beautiful" or "good". The earliest known name for the hill was Tsimadilo. It was renamed Ambohitrakanga ("hill of the guinea fowls") around 1700 by a dethroned prince named Andriamborona who, according to oral history, was the first to settle on the hilltop with his family. The hill received its current name from King <a href="Andriamasinavalona">Andriamasinavalona</a> in the early 18th century.

Madagascar's central highlands, including the area around Ambohimanga, were first inhabited between 200 BCE–300 CE by the island's earliest settlers, the <a href="Vazimba">Vazimba</a>, who appear to have arrived by <a href="pirogue">pirogue</a> from southeastern <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests. By the 15th century the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina</a> <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Madagascar">ethnic group</a> from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings. The tombs of at least four Vazimba are located on or around Ambohimanga hill and are sites of pilgrimage, including the tombs of Ingorikelisahiloza, Andriantsidonina, Ramomba and Kotosarotra. In the mid-16th century the disparate Merina principalities were united as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Imerina">Kingdom of Imerina</a> under the rule of King <a href="Andriamanelo">Andriamanelo</a> (1540–1575), who initiated military campaigns to expel or assimilate the Vazimba population. Conflict with the Vazimba led Andriamanelo to fortify his hill town using earthen walls, stone gateways and deep defensive trenches. This fortified town model, called a "<a href="Rova%20%28Madagascar%29">rova</a>", was propagated by the noble class throughout Imerina until French colonization of Madagascar in 1895.

The earliest settlement at the height of Ambohimanga was most likely established in the 15th century, coinciding with the arrival of the Merina in the highlands. Rice paddies took the place of the original valley forests by the 16th century, and the growing population near the valleys around Ambohimanga became known by the clan name Tantsaha ("people of the cultivated land"). According to oral history, however, the first to settle the site of the Ambohimanga rova was Andriamborona, the dethroned prince of the highland territory of Imamo, who relocated to the then-unpopulated hilltop in around 1700 accompanied by his nephew, his wife, and his mother, Ratompobe. Merina king Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who reigned over Imerina from his royal compound in <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>, noticed a bonfire lit by the family on the southern face of the hill 24 kilometers away. The visibility of the site from his capital led Andriamasinavalona to desire Ambohimanga as a residence for his son, <a href="Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana%20Andriandrazaka">Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana</a>. Andriamborona and his family agreed to shift three times to different parts of the hill, including the future site of the royal compound of Bevato, in response to consecutive requests from the king. For a short time he and the prince lived in neighboring houses at Bevato before Andriamborona and his family finally left the hill for the distant highland village of <a href="Ambatolampy">Ambatolampy</a>, where he lived the rest of his life; the king retrieved their bodies for burial at Ambohimanga.

In 1710, Andriamasinavalona divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants, which were given to his four favorite sons to rule. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana received the eastern quadrant, Avaradrano, and transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital. As the first king of Avaradrano (1710–1730), Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also built the site's defensive walls and its first set of seven gates. Rather than rule their respective territories peacefully as Andriamasinavalona had intended, his four sons began a series of wars to seize control of neighboring territory, causing famine and suffering among the peasant population of Imerina. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana spent much of his reign strengthening the authority of his governance at Ambohimanga and attracting residents to settle in the surrounding villages while battling his brothers to increase the land under his control. He was succeeded by his adopted son, <a href="Andriambelomasina">Andriambelomasina</a> (1730–1770), who continued to rule Avaradrano from Ambohimanga in the Mahandrihono compound he built beside the original compound of Besakana. Andriambelomasina significantly expanded Ambohimanga and strengthened its defenses, enabling him to successfully repel an attack against the rova by a band of <a href="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> warriors employed by his chief rival, the ruler of Antananarivo. He named as his successor his eldest son, <a href="Andrianjafy">Andrianjafy</a> (1770–1787), and designated his grandson <a href="Andrianampoinimerina">Andrianampoinimerina</a> to follow Andrianjafy in the order of succession. Andrianjafy, a weak and unjust ruler, maintained his capital at Ambohimanga where he built a new private compound called Nanjakana, but often resided in the nearby village of <a href="Ilafy">Ilafy</a>.

Andrianampoinimerina dethroned Andrianjafy in a violent conflict that ended in 1787. The king then used Ambohimanga as a launching point for a successful campaign to bring the <a href="twelve%20sacred%20hills%20of%20Imerina">twelve sacred hills of Imerina</a> under his rule, including the hill city of Antananarivo, thereby reuniting the four quadrants of the divided Kingdom of Imerina under his sovereignty and putting an end to 77 years of civil war. To consolidate support for his rule, Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous <a href="Andriana">noble castes</a> to participate in the most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the <a href="Architecture%20of%20Madagascar">traditional style</a>.

Following the conquest of Antananarivo in 1793, Andrianampoinimerina shifted the political capital of Imerina from Ambohimanga to its original site at Antananarivo, while pronouncing Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital. Important traditional rituals continued to be held at Ambohimanga, and Andrianampoinimerina regularly stayed in its Mahandrihono palace. His son, <a href="Radama%20I">Radama I</a>, inhabited Ambohimanga's Nanjakana compound as a youth before relocating to Antananarivo, and visited Ambohimanga frequently after the move. Radama's widow and successor, <a href="Ranavalona%20I">Ranavalona I</a>, renovated the Mahandrihono compound and moved several buildings from the sister <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">rova at Antananarivo</a> to Ambohimanga. She also forbade swine at Ambohimanga due to their association with Europeans, who had propagated pork as a food source in the decade prior. Subsequent queens made their own mark on the site, including the reconstruction of Nanjakana by <a href="Rasoherina">Rasoherina</a>, and <a href="Ranavalona%20II">Ranavalona II</a>'s addition of two large pavilions to the Mahandrihono compound that reflected a syncretism of traditional and Western architectural styles.

Throughout much of the 19th century and particularly under the reign of Queen Ranavalona I (1828–1861), Ambohimanga was forbidden to visiting foreigners, contributing to its mystique as a "forbidden city". This status remained until 1897 when the <a href="French%20Madagascar">French colonial administration</a> transferred all the relics and significant belongings of the royal family from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo to break the spirit of resistance and ethnic identity that these symbols inspired in the Malagasy people, particularly in the highlands. In the early 20th century, the area was further changed when the French removed the sacred forests remaining on the neighboring hilltops in the early 20th century. The city nonetheless retains its symbolic significance in Imerina to this day.

Ambohimanga is located in the central highlands of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, approximately northeast of the capital city of Antananarivo. The hill rises steeply approximately 450 feet from the surrounding terrain on its eastern side and gradually slopes downward toward the west. The royal city of the same name, situated at the peak of the hill, has panoramic views of the surrounding hills and valleys, and is surrounded on the hill's slopes and the valley floor by the houses of residents of Ambohimanga village. The terraced rice paddies that cover the hillsides to the north and south of the royal city were created in the 17th and 18th centuries to provide a staple food source to the inhabitants of the hill and its surrounding villages. The crest of Ambohimanga is higher than the surrounding hills and others among the traditionally designated twelve sacred hills of Imerina, symbolically indicative of the site's political significance relative to other similar hill towns. This elevation also offered an excellent vantage point for surveying the surrounding areas for advancing enemy troops. Rising from among the surrounding valleys and terraced rice paddies, the hill is topped with a forest that was exempted from the widespread deforestation of the highlands due to its sacred nature. The UNESCO World Heritage Site encompassing the hill and the royal city at its peak extends over a surface area of 59 hectares, with a buffer zone of 425 hectares.

The layout of Ambohimanga's three compounds and the structures within them followed a traditional design established by the earliest Merina highland settlers by the 15th century. According to custom, a rova could only be established by an "<a href="andriana">andriana</a>" (noble). Its foundation was built to raise the rova higher than the surrounding buildings outside its walls. Contained within the rova was at least one "lapa" (royal palace or residence) as well as the "fasana" (tomb) of one or more of the site's founders and family members. It also enclosed a "kianja" (courtyard) marked by a "vatomasina" (sacred stone) that elevated the sovereign above the people for the delivery of "<a href="Hainteny%23Kabary">kabary</a>" (royal speeches or decrees). The sovereign's lodgings typically stood in the northern part of the rova, while the spouse or spouses lived in the southern part.

At Ambohimanga, as in other rova sites, the cardinal and vertical layout of these various traditional components embodies two cosmological notions of space that coexisted in traditional Imerina. The older system governed sociopolitical order and was based on the concept of the four cardinal points radiating from a unifying center. A more recent system introduced through the astrology of seafaring Arabs governed the spiritual order and placed special significance on the northeast. The sacred eastern portions of Ambohimanga contained structures associated with the veneration of the ancestors, including the royal tombs, basins of holy water used in royal rituals, and numerous "Ficus" and "Draceana" trees, which were symbolic of royalty. The northern portion of the site is the location of a courtyard where royal judgments were handed down from atop a prominent granite boulder, in line with the Malagasy association between the northern cardinal point, masculinity, and political power. The houses of the royal wives were formerly located in the southern portion of the site, a cardinal point traditionally associated with femininity and spiritual power. These competing cosmological systems are also reflected in the placement of the city's main gates at cardinal points, as well as the northeastern gates reserved for use by the sovereign and dedicated to their role in sacred rituals.

The orientation and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space. The placement of the city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems. Centrally located Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.

Between these two systems, that of the political order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness of the city was historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for the extent to which it was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.

A series of protective trenches ("hadivory") and stone walls, typical of fortified royal cities in Imerina since the 15th century, surround the village of Ambohimanga. The trenches vary in depth to a maximum of . The oldest trenches at the site, called Mazavatokana, are located behind the modern-day rova and appear to predate the reign of the hill's first known king, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana; local tradition maintains that they were dug in the early 16th century on the command of King <a href="Andrianjaka">Andrianjaka</a>, who may have used the site as a launching point for military offensives in his war against the Vazimba. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was the first to systematically establish a network of defenses around the hilltop settlement. This first king of Ambohimanga dug trenches around his Bevato compound, which was initially only accessible through a gateway he named Ambavahadikely.

The settlement was expanded by the construction of trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with two additional access points named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders. This latter entrance was most likely used to access the space even before the formal establishment of a royal city there, and is therefore considered by archaeologists to be the oldest gateway at the site. After the establishment of the rova, this entrance was reserved for use by the sovereign, a reflection of the spiritual significance of the northeastern direction and its association with the ancestors, whose benediction and "<a href="Hasina%20%28Madagascar%29">hasina</a>" provided the basis for the sovereign's power and legitimacy. It was also used to bring sacrificial cattle into the compound. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses, including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches, and he constructed several additional gates that he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina. Andrianampoinimerina expanded the trenches around the city using "<a href="Corv%C3%A9e">fanampoana</a>" labor. During his reign, a trench was dug that entirely encircles the hill, and a series of trenches was dug alongside existing ones to further protect the city against enemies. The current defensive wall was reconstructed around 1830 during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I. An estimated sixteen million egg whites were mixed with lime to produce the whitewash for the compound's exterior and interior walls. Until French colonization in 1897 and at least as early as the reign of Radama I, foreigners and non-residents were not allowed to enter the royal city without authorization from the sovereign.

The royal compound can be accessed through fourteen stone gateways in total. In addition to the inner seven gateways constructed by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in the early 18th century, there exists an exterior wall and second set of seven gates that were built before 1794 during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina, an act that symbolically marked the completion of the king's reunification of Imerina. The largest and principal gate is also the most well-preserved and is known as Ambatomitsangana ("standing stone"). Every morning and evening, a team of twenty soldiers would work together to roll into place an enormous stone disk, 40.5 meters in diameter and 30 cm thick, weighing about 12 tons, to open or seal off the doorway. This form of gate ("vavahady" in the Malagasy language), typical of most walled royal villages of <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Imerina</a> built between 1525 and 1897, protected the villagers from marauders.The gateway is topped by an observation post. The second main entrance, called Andakana, is situated in the western wall. Its stone disk is also intact, and the path leading to it is paved with cut stones. Both Ambatomitsangana and Andakana were considered the gateways of the living; cadavers could not be transported through them, and passage was denied to anyone who had recently come into contact with the dead. A northern gateway called Miandrivahiny retains its well-preserved stone disk and was one of two entrances used whenever it was necessary to transport corpses in or out of the site; the second gateway for corpses was called Amboara. The stone disk at the southern Andranomatsatso gateway is also in good condition. This gateway, as well as Antsolatra and Ampitsaharana, were primarily used as lookout points. In the late 18th century Andrianampoinimerina replaced the Ambavahadiantandranomasina gate with another made of wood instead of stone and renamed it Ambavahadimasina. He and his successors shaved a small piece of wood from this lintel to light the sacred hearth fire that played a ritual role in the traditional circumcision ceremony. The red soil inside the gate and a series of wooden boards that paneled the approach to the gate were both considered sacred, and soldiers or others who anticipated a voyage away from Imerina would take handfuls of the soil and pieces of the wooden boards with them before departing in the belief that it would ensure their safe return.

Several large stones are set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each identified by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the main site at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after its death, the animal was cut into pieces and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly invoked in royal speeches and decrees to allude to the fate of those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.

Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed a stream that is believed to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes the creation of the lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to dig the lake at the site of the spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing <a href="zebu">zebu</a> at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.

The forest at Ambohimanga benefited from customary protection and today represents the largest of the last remaining fragments of primary forest that formerly covered the highlands. It contains a representative assortment of native tree and plant species, in particular the endemic tree "zahana" ("phyllarthron madagascariensis") and a variety of indigenous medicinal plants, many possessing traditional or spiritual importance. Examples include the native bush "Anthocleista", traditionally believed to attract lightning and often planted in clusters beside villages; the "Dracaena" plant, traditionally used for hedges and planted at sacred sites in valleys or other natural features where people would come to communicate with ancestral spirits; and the "Phyllarthron" vine, which was planted in sacred thickets and harvested for its wood, which was traditionally used to fashion handles for diverse tools. The recent and growing presence of two foreign species (<a href="Bambusa%20vulgaris">golden bamboo</a> and "<a href="lantana">lantana</a>") threaten the integrity of the site's ecosystem. The local management authority is currently engaged in activities to eradicate the encroaching vegetation.

The villages surrounding the royal city date back to at least the 16th century, when the valleys around Ambohimanga hill were first transformed into rice paddies. Following the establishment of a royal city on the hilltop, successive rulers put in place regulations to govern the development of these villages and manage the subjects inhabiting them. Under Andrianampoinimerina, quotas established a set number of houses for members of influential clans in designated neighborhoods around the hill. This king also established rules to improve sanitation, including standards of cleanliness in domestic courtyards and the quarantine of people suffering from certain illnesses. Ranavalona I specified the physical characteristics of newly constructed houses, including their size and decorative features. In 1862 Radama II gave permission to a group of Christians to negotiate with Tsimahafotsy elders to construct the village's first church, but the Tsimahafotsy initially rejected the request. The king's successor, Queen Rasoherina, later requested the Christians not to gather indoors for services at Ambohimanga in honor of the sanctity of the ancestors. The court was Christianized by Ranavalona II in 1869, and a small chapel was built outside the city's eastern gate, but a permanent church at Ambohimanga was not built until 1883. Following a fire that occurred in 1870 during a visit of Ranavalona II to Ambohimanga, the queen decreed that houses in the village could be constructed in brick, a material previously reserved for tomb and wall construction. A series of ancestral "fady" (taboos) decreed by Andrianampoinimerina continue to apply in the village, and include prohibitions against corn, pumpkins, pigs, onions, hedgehogs and snails; the use of reeds for cooking; and the cutting or collecting of wood from the sacred forests on the hill.

Each of the three compounds built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over the reign of the 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of <a href="architecture%20of%20Madagascar%23Merina%20aristocratic%20tradition">traditional Merina</a> and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.

The earliest of the royal compounds at Ambohimanga, Bevato ("many stones", also called Fidasiana-Bevato), was first established by Andriamborona, who built houses there for himself and his family in the late 17th century. It was inhabited by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana from 1710 to 1730, during which time he expanded the compound on three occasions. The compound was originally surrounded by a low rock wall that was replaced under Andriambelomasina by a wooden palisade. Ranavalona I expanded the compound toward the west by relocating a small house containing the <a href="sampy">royal idol</a> Rafantaka; further westward expansion was completed under Ranavalona II. Under Ranavalona I and her successors, Besakana served as the residence of the sovereign's relatives during their visits to Ambohimanga. All buildings on the compound were destroyed by the French, who <a href="Education%20in%20Madagascar">constructed a school</a> on the site ("Ecole Officiel"), later followed by the Ambohimanga town hall ("Tranompokonolona"), which was razed after Madagascar regained independence.

Andriamborona, the first inhabitant of the hill, built a tomb for his mother in Bevato. When the king asked him to relocate, Andriamborona agreed to move both his houses and his mother's tomb. In acknowledgement of this consideration, the king marked the site of the tomb with a large stone and nearby he built the first royal residence at the rova as his home. The stone was thereafter considered sacred: Andrianampoinimerina was enthroned while standing atop this stone, and slaves were brought there to swear allegiance to their masters. It was used in the ritual sacrifice of "volavita" zebu during the "<a href="Fandroana">Fandroana</a>" Malagasy New Year (a festival also known as the "royal bath"). Sovereigns traveling on horseback would stand upon it to aid in mounting or dismounting, and after the Christianization of the court under Ranavalona II in 1869, religious services took place here. The royal tombs were relocated to the Mahandrihono compound under Ranavalona I to expand the courtyard.

According to the "<a href="Tantara%20ny%20Andriana%20eto%20Madagasikara">Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara</a>" transcription of Merina oral histories, the first house built by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was called Bevato. It was located at the southern extreme of the compound and housed the king and his wives. Andriambelomasina built and occupied a second house, called Manatsaralehibe ("large and great"). This house was highly venerated by Andrianampoinimerina: escaped convicts who managed to reach the building were pardoned, and this was the only historic house in the compound that Ranavalona I did not remove. According to a second source, the two oldest houses in the compound were called Mahitsielafanjaka ("one who is upright rules long") and Manatsarakely ("small and great"). These were reportedly built by either Andriamborona or Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana in the early 18th century and were occupied by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana and his 12 wives. Another account states that Manatsarakely was inhabited by Andrianjafy and later by the wives of Andrianampoinimerina; this house and Mahitsielafanjaka were renovated under Ranavalona I using wood from the region of Sihanaka to repanel the walls.

Oral history credits Andrianampoinimerina with the construction of a second pair of houses in the compound. Beginning with his reign, Bevato became the second most important compound after Mahandrihono and enclosed four houses for royal wives and their servants. He also kept the royal idol Ifantaka here in a small house surrounded by a wooden palisade, which remained until the Christian convert Ranavalona II symbolically destroyed the royal idols in a bonfire in 1869. After removing the historic Tsararay in the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Bevato compound. Tsararay was the residence of his wives when they would make the journey to Ambohimanga. The Bevato compound in Antananarivo was likewise reserved for the sovereign's wives under the reign of Andrianampoinimerina, but featured many more houses to enable each wife her own residence. When wives would travel to Ambohimanga they were obliged to share the houses, and those who preferred not to share typically stayed at the houses of villagers beyond the city walls.

Ranavalona I planted a pair of royal <a href="fig%20tree">fig tree</a>s at the far end of the Bevato compound and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and <a href="Jacaranda%20mimosifolia">jacarandas</a> planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with "hasina" enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.

While Bevato was the location of larger gatherings and royal festivals, royal edicts and public judgments were handed down in the sacred courtyard ("kianja") of Ambarangotina at the base of the hill leading to the Bevato compound. From the kianja sovereigns delivered "kabary" to announce new laws and decrees and administer justice. The sovereign would stand atop the kianja's "vatomasina" (a large granite boulder), which is surrounded by a brick half-wall and accessed by a set of steps.

The compound Mahandrihono ("knows how to wait") is the most expansive and well-preserved of the rova structures at Ambohimanga. It lies to the east of the central courtyard and sits at a higher elevation than Bevato, symbolically representing its greater political significance. It was first established by Andriambelomasina in the early 18th century during the reign of his father, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriambelomasina surrounded the compound with a stone wall and within it built three houses as residences for his children—two twin houses ("tranokambana") set side by side named Mahandry ("knows how to wait") and Tsararay ("has a good father"), and a third named Manandraimanjaka ("has a father who rules")—taking pains to illustrate through the names of these houses that he had no intention of usurping his father. When Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana eventually died, Andriambelomasina entombed him behind the twin houses. In Andrianampoinimerina's time this compound corresponded with the Mahandrihono compound at the rova in Antananarivo, being reserved for the king alone with his residence positioned beside the tombs of the ancestors.

Andrianampoinimerina removed the twin houses to build his much larger Mahandrihono residence, which was decorated with silver birds and chains. He also expanded the compound and added a second enclosure of "voafotsy" wood (replaced annually) around the exterior of the stone walls. Mandraimanjaka was removed and in its place Andrianampoinimerina built a house with a small tower, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where it is good to rule"), designating it as the residence for the royal "<a href="sampy">sampy</a>" (idol) called Imanjakatsiroa and the guardians assigned to protect it. Two other idols were kept nearby: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, guarded in its house at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, the stone wall was reinforced with palisades that enclosed three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had built. Ranavalona I enlarged the compound's courtyard and expanded Manjakamiadana. She constructed the stone walls that currently enclose the compound, as well as its two stone gateways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's stone walls. She demolished Manjakamiadana and in its place constructed two hybrid Malagasy-European pavilions using wood from the historic and spiritually significant Masoandro house, which had been removed from the royal compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general <a href="Joseph%20Gallieni">Joseph Gallieni</a> used these European-influenced buildings as his summer residence in the early years of the French colonial period. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's original house, the reconstructed tombs, and the two royal pavilions are preserved in the compound, which also includes a watchtower, a pen for sacrificial zebu, and two pools constructed during the reign of Ranavalona I.

Among the buildings extant at the royal city during the time of King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid <a href="rosewood">rosewood</a> and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns ("tandrotrano") formed at each end of the roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.

Two ornate palace buildings were built of rosewood in this compound in 1871 on the former site of the Manjakamiadana royal idol residence. The first and larger of the two, Fandriampahalemana, features a room for receiving visitors and a large salon on the ground floor, and the bedrooms of Queen Ranavalona II and her serving lady on the second floor. The original European furnishings have been preserved, and the many gifts given by foreign dignitaries to the queen are on display here. The queen's bedroom is considered a sacred place and many visitors come on pilgrimage to pray to her spirit.

The second, smaller pavilion is known as the Tranofitaratra ("house of glass") and was constructed in 1862 under the orders of Ranavalona II. The queen would gather her ministers for counsel in this building, and the large windows on all four sides of the building provided a view of the countryside below, enabling the queen to ascertain the security of her surroundings. The glass used in the construction was imported by an Englishman named Parrett in 1862.

The compound originally housed twelve royal tombs constructed in the style of Merina nobles, with a stone crypt topped by a small, windowless wooden house ("tranomasina") indicative of aristocratic rank. The peaks of these tombs were aligned from north to south. Sovereigns originally buried in the four largest tombs, situated to the north of the others, included Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, Andriambelomasina, Andriampoinimerina, Ranavalona I and Ranavalona II, while the wives and relatives of sovereigns were buried in the smaller tombs. According to oral histories, at its 19th-century peak the Ambohimanga compound contained 12 tombs.

The tranomasina were destroyed in March 1897 by French authorities who removed the bodies of the sovereigns interred here and relocated them to the royal tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo. The rich collection of funerary objects enclosed within the tombs was also removed for display in the Manjakamiadana palace on the Antananarivo rova grounds, which the Colonial Authority transformed into an ethnological museum. This was done in an effort to desanctify the city of Ambohimanga and break the spirit of the <a href="Menalamba%20rebellion">"Menalamba"</a> resistance fighters who had been rebelling against French colonization for the past year, break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors, and relegate Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. A French garrison was housed within the royal city and military buildings were erected on top of the stone tomb foundations. A kitchen and military canteen were built on top of the tombs of Andrianampoinimerina and Andriamasinavalona. By 1904, the military buildings were likewise demolished, leaving the stone tomb foundations intact.

The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power. In the popular view, the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors (Andrianampoinimerina in particular) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source of legitimate power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and deviance from ancestral tradition. Believing that the presence of the ancestors within the tombs sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built, Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt from the base of the tombs to carry with them in their offensives against the French; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns' bodies from the tombs to undermine the fighters' confidence and solidarity. Although the tombs were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated, Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character. The royal tombs were reconstructed in 2008 by the government of Madagascar under the <a href="Marc%20Ravalomanana">Ravalomanana</a> administration. During the 1995 fire that destroyed the tombs and other structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the "<a href="lamba%20%28garment%29">lamba</a>"-wrapped remains of only one sovereign—<a href="Ranavalona%20III">Ranavalona III</a>—could be saved from the flames. The queen has since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.

Two large basins have been carved from the stone foundation of the compound. Both constructed under Ranavalona I, one was a pool built in honor of the wives of soldiers of the ennobled <a href="Hova%20%28Madagascar%29">Hova</a> Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga, while the other was built for the wives of members of the elite military corps known as "the 500". The pools were strictly forbidden for public bathing or drinking and contained fish from <a href="Lake%20Itasy">Lake Itasy</a> and specially consecrated water. Ranavalona I and her successors Radama I and Rasoherina used the larger royal pool for ritual purification during the annual fandroana new year festival.

Sacred zebu were kept in a sunken cattle pen ("fahimasina") to the west of the "kianja" courtyard before sacrifice at royal events such as circumcisions and the fandroana festival. Only the two most highly prized types of zebu were kept here: black zebu with white markings on the forehead, called "volavita", and entirely reddish-brown zebu, called "malaza". In this way, the cattle were made to walk from the west toward the east (the direction of the ancestors and sanctity) before being slaughtered. Another large pen for sacrificial zebu was located to the northeast of this courtyard before being filled in by the French Colonial Authority in the late 19th century.

The Nanjakana compound is the most highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound is believed to have been first constructed by <a href="Andrianjafy">Andrianjafy</a> in the late eighteenth century. To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a clear view of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.

During the reign of Andrianampoinimerina, Nanjakana enclosed five houses that served as residences for his children. The house called Nanjakana ("place of royalty") was built by Andriambelomasina and renovated by Andrianampoinimerina, who moved it into the compound and lived in it before succeeding to the throne. He renovated it for use by his son, Radama I, who slept here during visits to Ambohimanga after succeeding his father as King of Madagascar. According to oral history, a large stone near the Nanjakana house was used as a seat by Andriambelomasina and Andrianampoinimerina when reflecting on governance decisions. Andrianampoinimerina added a two-story house called Manambitana ("favored by fate") that was the largest of all the traditional houses at Ambohimanga. The king's children slept on the upper floor during visits to the royal city, while the ground floor housed such royal property as palanquins and storage chests. This house was destroyed in the 1861 fire and was reconstructed under Rasoherina, who used it as a residence. After removing the historic Manandraimanjaka house from the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Nanjakana compound. This was likewise destroyed in the 1861 fire, and was later rebuilt by Ranavalona II. Also destroyed in the fire was a house called Fohiloha ("short") that Ranavalona I had relocated from the royal compound in Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga in 1845; Fohiloha was later rebuilt by Rasoherina. Other buildings that Ranavalona I moved from the rova at Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga included Kelisoa ("beautiful little one") and Manantsara.

A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga received 97,847 visitors in 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 "<a href="Malagasy%20ariary">ariary</a>" for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely used to pay for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site as a consequence of the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 Malagasy political crisis</a>; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.

The extent of the area currently classified a World Heritage Site was under restricted access and protection during the imperial era and has been under some form of legal recognition and protection since French colonization, having been incorporated into the Colony Domains Service in 1897 and the National Inventory in 1939. It has since benefited from legal municipal protection and two national laws (passed in 1982 and 1983) protecting sites of historical and national interest. The Office of the Cultural Site of Ambohimanga (OSCAR), created by the Ministry of Culture, has managed the site and its entrance fees and state subventions since 2006, when a five-year management plan was developed for implementation by the group's 30 employees. These management and conservation activities are conducted in cooperation with the local population within the Rural Commune of Ambohimanga Rova. The Village Committee, comprising representatives of all the adjacent quarters and the local community, are also involved in the protection of the site. Conservation of Ambohimanga is further supported by a private association, Mamelomaso, which has also been active in campaigning for awareness and protection of cultural heritage and has contributed to the preservation of numerous other sites of cultural and historic significance in the highlands. In addition to helping replant the Ambohimanga woodlands, Mamelomaso has contributed to the restoration of the stones around the source of the spring, erected informational plaques around the hill, and paved a number of footpaths within the site. UNESCO contributed special financial support to restore historic structures at Ambohimanga threatened by exceptionally heavy rainfall and landslides.

Ambohimanga has been viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century as the embodiment of an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles ("andriana") believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction ("hasina") to serve as the national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.

Despite these measures, the conservation of Ambohimanga is challenged by human and natural factors. The rapidly growing but relatively impoverished population around Ambohimanga occasionally engages in illegal harvesting of plants and trees from the surrounding forests, threatening the integrity of the natural environment. The forests and wooden structures on the site are also susceptible to fire. Following the 1995 destruction by fire of Ambohimanga's sister rova at Antananarivo, widely believed to have been a politically motivated arson, rumors have circulated that Ambohimanga could suffer a similar fate. <a href="Cyclone%20Giovanna">Cyclone Giovanna</a>, which passed over Madagascar in February 2012, caused considerable damage at the site. The wooden shingles of Andrianampoinimerina's house were torn off by the wind, exposing the historic objects inside to damage from the elements. The wooden fence surrounding the Mahandrihono compound was also badly damaged. Worst affected are the plants and trees at the site. Large swaths of endemic medicinal plants and trees in the forest were destroyed. Many of the sacred trees shading the royal city were uprooted, including sacred fig trees around the Fidasiana courtyard and inside the zebu pen. Two of the uprooted trees were of particular symbolic significance, having served as physical anchors for certain royal rituals since the 17th century. Shortly after the storm, OSCAR unveiled plans to plant a substitute fig for the uprooted one that had shaded the sacred stone in the Fidasiana courtyard. Most of the historic jacarandas planted over a century ago under French colonial rule were also destroyed. The extent of damage to the site has prompted traditionalists to demand renewed respect for the sanctity of the site by requesting adherence to traditional taboos put in place by Merina monarchs. These include banning pigs at the site, as well as the consumption of pork, tobacco, alcohol and cannabis on the grounds of the royal city.

Romance (Luis Miguel album)

Romance is the eighth <a href="Album%23Studio%20album">studio album</a> by Mexican singer <a href="Luis%20Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>. It was released by <a href="Warner%20Music%20Latina">WEA Latina</a> on 19 November 1991. Although the production was originally intended as another collaboration with <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Juan Carlos Calderón</a>, that plan was scrapped when Calderón was unable to compose songs for the album. Facing a new-material deadline in his recording contract, at his manager's suggestion Miguel chose <a href="bolero">bolero</a> music for his next project. Mexican singer-songwriter <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a> was hired by WEA Latina to co-produce the album with Miguel. Recording began in August 1991 at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California, with <a href="Bebu%20Silvetti">Bebu Silvetti</a> the <a href="Arrangement">arranger</a>.

On the album Miguel <a href="cover%20version">covers</a> twelve boleros, originally recorded from 1944 to 1986. The first two singles, "<a href="Inolvidable%20%28song%29">Inolvidable</a>" and "No Sé Tú", reached number one on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart in the United States and spent six months atop the Mexican charts. "Mucho Corazón" and "Cómo" were in the top five of the Hot Latin Songs chart, and "Usted" and "La Barca" received <a href="airplay">airplay</a> throughout Latin America. Miguel promoted the record with a tour of the United States and Latin America. The album was generally well received by <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>, who praised Miguel's singing and the record's production. The singer received several accolades, including a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a> nomination for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Best Latin Pop Album</a>.

"Romance" sold over seven million copies worldwide, his bestselling record in his music career. In the United States, it spent 32 weeks at number one on the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a> chart, and was the first Spanish-language album by a non-<a href="crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> Latin artist to be certified <a href="music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA); it was also certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, firsts for a Spanish-speaking artist. "Romance" is the third-bestselling album of all time in Mexico, and the bestselling record in Argentina by a non-native artist. The album was noted by critics as reviving interest in bolero music. Its success encouraged Miguel to release three more bolero records: "<a href="Segundo%20Romance">Segundo Romance</a>" (1994), "<a href="Romances%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romances</a>" (1997) and "<a href="Mis%20Romances">Mis Romances</a>" (2001).

Since Miguel signed with WEA Latina in 1986, his albums "<a href="Soy%20Como%20Quiero%20Ser">Soy Como Quiero Ser</a>" (1987), "<a href="Busca%20una%20Mujer">Busca una Mujer</a>" (1988), and "<a href="20%20A%C3%B1os%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">20 Años</a>" (1990) have sold over three million copies cumulatively in Mexico. His early recordings consisted of <a href="soft%20rock">soft rock</a> and <a href="pop%20ballad">pop ballad</a> tunes, which led to Miguel becoming a <a href="teen%20idol">teen idol</a>. On 14 January 1991, WEA Latina announced a new album with longtime producer and composer <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Juan Carlos Calderón</a>, who produced the three previous records by Miguel. Wanting to replicate the success of "20 Años", Calderón would compose pop songs and ballads and find tracks for Miguel to cover in Spanish. Production was scheduled to begin in April, with Italian- and English-language studio albums to follow. The record label was unconvinced by Calderón's pre-selected songs; he had to write more compositions, and production halted indefinitely. Ultimately, he was unable to compose songs for the album.

Miguel had a contractual deadline with his label to record new material, and considered recording <a href="bolero">bolero</a>s (slow <a href="ballad">ballad</a>s "endowed with romantic lyrics") after meeting Mexican singer-songwriter <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a> during a televised interview. The singer had performed boleros (including compositions recorded by Manzanero) during his . At the suggestion of manager Hugo López, and realizing that he could appeal to an older audience, Miguel chose boleros for his next album and WEA Latina hired Manzanero to take over its production. Manzanero was enthusiastic, hoping that Miguel's popularity would introduce the genre to young listeners. On 25 October 1991, the album's title was announced as a homage to boleros; it was Miguel's first as a producer.

Recording began on 24 August 1991, at <a href="Ocean%20Way%20Recording">Ocean Way Recording</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, California. Miguel and Manzanero produced the album, with <a href="Bebu%20Silvetti">Bebu Silvetti</a> arranging the <a href="string%20section">strings</a> with additional contributions from 32 violinists under the direction of American conductor Ezra Kliger. On "Romance" Miguel covers twelve boleros (with each track being described as <a href="love%20song">love numbers</a>), which were selected by Manzanero from five hundred songs including his "Te Extraño" and "No Sé Tú". Seven of the twelve tracks were recorded by 13 September when production was suspended the following day when Miguel was hospitalized with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. The album's planned late-October release was postponed until 19 November and recording resumed two weeks after Miguel was hospitalized.

"Inolvidable" was released as "Romance"s <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> in November 1991. It reached number one on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart in the United States the week of 25 January 1992, topping the chart for five weeks. Its second single, "No Sé Tú", was released in February 1992 and reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart the week of 18 April, topping the chart for seven weeks. The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "No Sé Tú" was directed by Pedro Torres and filmed in Miami, it features Miguel and an orchestra performing in front of a building. The video premiered on 16 February on the Mexican variety show "<a href="Siempre%20en%20Domingo%20%28TV%20series%29">Siempre en Domingo</a>". "Inolvidable" and "No Sé Tú" ended 1992 as the third- and second-<a href="Billboard%20Top%20Latin%20Songs%20Year-End%20Chart">best-performing Latin songs of the year</a>, respectively, in the United States. In Mexico, the songs topped the charts for a total of six months. The album's third single, "Contigo en la Distancia", was released in Mexico in July 1992; its music video was also directed by Torres and filmed in Miami. "Mucho Corazón" peaked at number three on the Hot Latin Songs chart, with "Cómo" peaking at number four. "Usted" and "La Barca" received airplay throughout Latin America.

To promote the record, Miguel began his on 22 March 1992 at a sold out 10,000-seat <a href="National%20Auditorium">National Auditorium</a> in Mexico City. After performing throughout Latin America and the United States, he concluded the tour in Chile in December. In addition to touring, Miguel performed at the <a href="Seville%20Expo%20%2792">Seville Expo '92</a> in Spain. His <a href="set%20list">set list</a> consisted primarily of songs from his earlier career and boleros from "Romance". In October 1992 WEA Latina released "<a href="Am%C3%A9rica%20%26amp%3B%20En%20Vivo">América & En Vivo</a>", a <a href="live%20album">live EP</a> featuring a new track ("America, America") and tour recordings of "Contigo en la Distancia", "No Sé Tú" and "Inolvidable". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gave the EP three stars out of five.

AllMusic editor Janet Rosen gave "Romance" three stars out of five, saying that it "features the usual smooth, well-crafted pop ear candy from Luis Miguel, earnestly sung over strings and polite Latin rhythms". However, she noted that the songs in the album booklet and the lack of liner notes made it difficult for listeners to know what "to make of this presentation". Rosen concluded, "It doesn't matter—the title of the release says it all." <a href="Achy%20Obejas">Achy Obejas</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" gave the record four stars out of four, praising Miguel's refusal "to get campy, which gives the effort far more integrity than might have been imagined" and calling his take on boleros "vibrant and real." Mark Holston reviewed the album positively in the magazine "Américas", praising Miguel's vocals, the choice of songs and Silvetti's arrangements: ""Romance" is a reminder of the enduring quality of timeless music". "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>" critic John Lannert called "Romance" a "superb collection of updated classics" and complimented the artist for staying "fairly close to the string-laden original versions".

At the 1992 <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Award">"Billboard" Music Awards</a> Miguel was the Top Pop Latin Artist and the Top Hot Latin Tracks Artist, and "Romance" was the Top Pop Latin Album. In Chile, "Romance" won the Laurel de Oro Award for best album of the year. The singer was the Best Artist From a Non-English-Speaking Country at the Korean International Music Awards. At the <a href="35th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1993 Grammy Awards</a>, "Romance" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Best Latin Pop Album</a>, which was awarded to <a href="Jon%20Secada">Jon Secada</a> for his album "<a href="Otro%20D%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1s%20Sin%20Verte">Otro Día Más Sin Verte</a>". That year "Romance" was also nominated for <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Album of the Year</a> at the <a href="Premio%20Lo%20Nuestro%201993">Lo Nuestro Awards</a>, again losing to Secada for his <a href="Jon%20Secada%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a>. At the 1993 annual Premios "Eres", Miguel won three awards: Best Album, Best Male Singer and Best Show (for his tour). The record was the Best International Album and Miguel won the Best International Artist of the Year at the 1993 Ronda de Venezuela awards.

"Romance" was released internationally on 19 November 1991, and sold over 400,000 copies in its first 10 days. In Mexico it was certified octuple <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum</a> by the <a href="Asociaci%C3%B3n%20Mexicana%20de%20Productores%20de%20Fonogramas%20y%20Videogramas">Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas</a> (AMPROFON) for shipping two million copies, the country's all-time third-bestselling album (only <a href="Juan%20Gabriel">Juan Gabriel</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Jos%C3%A9">José José</a> has sold more copies with "<a href="Recuerdos%2C%20Vol.%20II">Recuerdos, Vol. II</a>" and "20 Triunfadoras" respectively). In the United States, "Romance" debuted at number ten on the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a> chart for the week of 14 December 1991, and reached number one four weeks later. The record topped the chart for 32 consecutive weeks when it was displaced by Jon Secada's eponymous album on the week of 22 August 1992, ending 1992 and 1993 as the bestselling Latin pop album of the year in the country. It was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, and the first gold certification by a non-crossover Latin artist in the United States (later certified platinum in the U.S. by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a> for shipments of one million copies). In South America, "Romance" was certified platinum in Colombia and Venezuela, gold in Paraguay and double platinum in Peru. In Argentina the album was certified 16× platinum for sales of over one million copies, the bestselling record by a non-Argentine artist. It received a diamond award from the <a href="Argentine%20Chamber%20of%20Phonograms%20and%20Videograms%20Producers">Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers</a> (CAPIF), and was certified quadruple platinum in Chile and double platinum in Spain. As of 2013, "Romance" had sold over seven million copies worldwide and is Miguel's bestselling record.

"Romance" was credited by music critics to have renewed mainstream interest in bolero music. According to "Chicago Tribune" editor Monica Eng, "Just as <a href="Harry%20Connick%2C%20Jr.">Harry Connick, Jr.</a> re-popularized the sounds of <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Sinatra</a> and <a href="Tony%20Bennett">Tony Bennett</a>, Mexican platinum-selling heartthrob Luis Miguel brought back an appreciation for the music of Mexico's boleristas." In "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>", Mary Talbot compared renewed interest in boleros to the revival of <a href="big%20band">big band</a> and <a href="swing%20music">swing music</a> in the Anglo-American market, previously dominated by <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> (which had seized bolero's popularity during the 1960s). Elena Kellner of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" noted the album's "introducing old favorites to younger audiences" while Achy Obejas of the "Chicago Tribune" documented Miguel's popularity with older listeners. In "Latin Beat Magazine", Franz Reynold wrote that before Miguel, boleros were considered by young people the "music of the ancients, something to be feared, since it seemed to signal the advent of senility". Mark Holston wrote in "Américas" magazine that the record's "irresistible combination of classic songs, string-laden arrangements, and subtle contemporary influences proved to be the perfect formula to reawaken the bolero's slumbering passions once again."

In his book, "The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond", Ed Morales wrote that Miguel's collaboration with Manzanero "brought light to an overlooked master of [bolero]" and "was a significant update of the genre". "Romance" enhanced Silvetti's reputation as an arranger and producer; according to <a href="Leila%20Cobo">Leila Cobo</a> of <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a>, the album "categorically redefined the interpretations of traditional boleros" and "sparked a torrent of work for Silvetti, including records with <a href="Vic%20Damone">Vic Damone</a> and <a href="Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28singer%29">Engelbert Humperdinck</a>". His arrangements became known as the "Silvetti Sound", which Cobo described as "anchored in sweeping melodies, lush string arrangements, acoustic instrumentation, and above all, unabashed <a href="romanticism">romanticism</a>". "Romance"s success encouraged <a href="Linda%20Ronstadt">Linda Ronstadt</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28singer%29">José Luis Rodríguez</a> and <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a> to record modern versions of traditional boleros. According to Miguel's former manager Mauricio Abaroa, although boleros were still recorded by traditional musicians at the time, "what made Luis Miguel so successful was that it was a young man singing them and that he sang them like modern ballads". During the "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs Chart's 25th anniversary in 2011, Miguel was number one on the Hot Latin Songs Top Artists chart. Manzanero reflected on their partnership, saying that he "put in the mouths of his generation all of the great romantic songs that had a 30-year history". In 2015, "Billboard" listed "Romance" as one of the Essential Latin Albums of Past 50 Years, an editor writes: "What’s become so formulaic in Latin music these days -- the tribute album by a contemporary artist honoring a genius of another era -- started with "Romance"".

The album's success encouraged Miguel to record three more "Romance" records. Its follow-up, "<a href="Segundo%20Romance">Segundo Romance</a>", was released in 1994; Manzanero, Calderón and Kiko Cibrian co-produced with Miguel, and it won a Grammy Award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Best Latin Pop Performance</a>. In 1997 "<a href="Romances%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romances</a>" was released, with Miguel and Manzanero co-producing Silvetti's arrangements; it sold over 4.5 million copies, winning another Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance. A year later WEA Latina released "<a href="Todos%20Los%20Romances">Todos Los Romances</a>", a three-disc compilation of the romance-themed records. The fourth record in the series, "<a href="Mis%20Romances">Mis Romances</a>" (produced by Miguel), was released in 2001. Although the singer had planned a ten-album series, "Mis Romances" was critically and commercially unsuccessful. The following year saw the release of "<a href="Mis%20Boleros%20Favoritos">Mis Boleros Favoritos</a>", with 13 previously-recorded tracks from the "Romance" series and a new version of "Hasta Que Vuelvas". According to AllMusic editor Iván Adaime, the record's purpose was to "close this era" of the "Romance" series. In 2012, Warner Music Latina reissued a commemorative "Romance: 20th Anniversary" set with a CD, the original <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a> and three <a href="45%20rpm%20single">45 rpm single</a>s: "Inolvidable", "No Sé Tú" and "Contigo en la Distancia".

It was produced by Miguel with <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Juan Carlos Calderón</a>, Kiko Cibrian and <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a> and recorded in early 1994 at the <a href="Record%20Plant%20Studios">Record Plant</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.

Miguel promoted the album with tours in the United States and Latin America from August to December 1994. Four singles were released: "<a href="El%20D%C3%ADa%20Que%20Me%20Quieras%20%28song%29">El Día Que Me Quieras</a>", "La Media Vuelta", "Todo y Nada", and "Delirio". The former two reached the top of the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart in the United States.

"Segundo Romance" received positive reviews from <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>, who praised its production, Miguel's vocals and the choice of songs. It won several awards, including the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance</a>. By 1995, "Segundo Romance" had sold more than four million copies and achieved multi-<a href="Platinum%20certification">platinum</a> status in many Latin American countries and Spain, and was certified platinum in the United States. Like its predecessor, the album helped continue renewing mainstream interest in bolero music.

In 1991, Miguel released his eighth studio album, "<a href="Romance%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romance</a>", a collection of classic <a href="bolero">bolero</a>s (slow <a href="ballad">ballad</a>s "endowed with romantic lyrics"). The album was successful in Latin America and sold more than seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre and was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be <a href="record%20certification">certified gold</a> in Brazil, Taiwan and the United States. Despite its success, Miguel did not immediately release another album of boleros as the follow-up album. Instead, he recorded "<a href="Aries%20%28album%29">Aries</a>" (1993), an album comprising original pop ballads and dance songs with <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> influences. Four months after the release of "Aries", he confirmed that he would begin recording another collection of classic boleros in March 1994, with the working title "Romance II".
"Segundo Romance" was recorded at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a> in Los Angeles, chosen for its state-of-the-art recording facilities. Its title was announced in June 1994. Miguel co-produced the album with <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a> (who produced "Romance)", <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Juan Carlos Calderón</a> (who produced Miguel's albums prior to "Romance") and Kiko Cibrian (who co-produced "Aries"). Manzanero helped with <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s and song selection, Calderón was involved with the <a href="string%20section">string section</a> and Cibrian with <a href="Music%20director">music direction</a>.

The song "<a href="Lo%20Mejor%20de%20M%C3%AD%20%28song%29">Lo Mejor de Mí</a>", composed by <a href="Rudy%20P%C3%A9rez">Rudy Pérez</a>, was considered for inclusion on the album, but Miguel decided against recording it as he felt the song would work better as a ballad for his next album, rather than as a bolero.

"Segundo Romance" comprises 11 <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s of classic boleros, the oldest dating to 1934. The arrangements consist of <a href="string%20arrangement">string</a>s, <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> solos, and a piano. Other styles include covers of <a href="Carlos%20Gardel">Carlos Gardel</a> and <a href="Alfredo%20Le%20Pera">Alfredo Le Pera</a>'s <a href="tango">tango</a> "<a href="El%20D%C3%ADa%20Que%20Me%20Quieras%20%28song%29">El Día Que Me Quieras</a>", which uses a <a href="bandoneon">bandoneon</a> (an <a href="accordion">accordion</a> from Argentina), and the <a href="ranchera">ranchera</a>-bolero "La Media Vuelta" by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Alfredo%20Jim%C3%A9nez">José Alfredo Jiménez</a>, which features horns, strings, and Spanish guitars. The album features covers of three songs composed by Manzanero: "<a href="Somos%20Novios">Somos Novios</a>", "Cómo Yo Te Amé", and "Yo Sé Que Volverás".

"El Día Que Me Quieras" was released as the album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> on 5 August 1994. It reached number one on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart in the United States for the week of 17 September 1994, and remained there for five weeks. Its <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was directed by Kiko Guerrero and filmed at the <a href="Palacio%20de%20Bellas%20Artes">Palacio de Bellas Artes</a> in Mexico City with Miguel and a 36-piece orchestra. "La Media Vuelta", the second single, was released in November 1994 and reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart for the week of 26 November, topping the chart for three weeks. Its music video, directed by Pedro Torres and filmed in black-and-white, features Miguel reminiscing at a bar about a woman who deceived him. The third single, "Todo y Nada", reached number three on the Hot Latin Songs and number one on the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Airplay">"Billboard" Latin Pop Airplay</a> charts. "Todo y Nada" was featured as the main theme for the Mexican <a href="telenovela">telenovela</a> "<a href="Imperio%20de%20cristal">Imperio de cristal</a>" (1994). "Delirio", the fourth single, peaked at number 16 on the Hot Latin Songs chart; its music video was filmed in Brazil.

To promote the album, Miguel began his Segundo Romance Tour in August 1994 with 16 shows at the <a href="National%20Auditorium">National Auditorium</a> in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, which drew an audience of more than 155,000. Miguel performed throughout Mexico, the United States, Peru and Argentina until 31 December 1994, when the tour concluded in <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>. The first part of Miguel's <a href="set%20list">set list</a> featured pop songs and contemporary ballads; during the second half he sang boleros from "Segundo Romance" and ranchera songs, before closing with "Será Que No Me Amas", the Spanish version of <a href="the%20Jackson%205">the Jackson 5</a>'s "<a href="Blame%20It%20on%20the%20Boogie">Blame It on the Boogie</a>".

In October 1995, Warner Music released the "<a href="El%20Concierto">El Concierto</a>" <a href="live%20album">live album</a> and video, a compilation of Miguel's performances at the National Auditorium in Mexico City and his concert at the <a href="Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Amalfitani">Estadio Vélez</a> in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> praised its production and Miguel's performance.

AllMusic critic Jose F. Promis gave "Segundo Romance" four-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it "a first-rate collection of timeless Latin American standards" and praised Miguel's vocals and the production. According to Promis, the album "further established Miguel as a first-rate balladeer, and enhanced his immense international popularity, not only with the youth market, but with an older, more sophisticated market as well." Enrique Lopetegui of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" gave the album three stars out of four, saying that it contained "updated, well-produced versions of classic romantic bolero and tango songs". In "Americas" magazine, Mark Holston described "Segundo Romance" as a "superb encore", citing "El Día Que Me Quieras" and "Historia de un Amor" as "memorable songs". Though "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" reviewer Paul Verna wrote that it offered "few surprises," he praised Miguel's "scrumptious, <a href="sophisti-pop">sophisti-pop</a> take of 'Nosotros' and 'Delirio'." Mario Tarradell of the "<a href="Miami%20Herald">Miami Herald</a>" was less pleased with the album, writing that it "pales in comparison to the original". Tarradell criticized Miguel's vocals being "on autopilot" compared to his "rich, sophisticated hues" on "Romance" and called the singer's production a "bad idea".

In Argentina, Miguel received the "Asociación de Cronistas del Espectáculo" award for Latin Ballad Album by a Male Solo Artist in 1994. At the <a href="37th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1995 Grammy Awards</a> "Segundo Romance" won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Best Latin Pop Performance</a> award despite competition from Cristian Castro, <a href="Juan%20Gabriel">Juan Gabriel</a>, <a href="La%20Mafia">La Mafia</a> and <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>, the latter who was favored to win by John Lannert of "Billboard" for his album "<a href="De%20Mi%20Alma%20Latina">De Mi Alma Latina</a>". At the <a href="Premio%20Lo%20Nuestro%201995">seventh Lo Nuestro Awards</a> that year, Miguel won <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Male%20Artist%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Male Artist of the Year</a>, <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Album of the Year</a>, and <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a> for "La Media Vuelta"; "El Día Que Me Quieras" was nominated for <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Song of the Year</a>. "Segundo Romance" won the award for the Pop Album of the Year by a Male Artist at the 1995 <a href="Billboard%20Latin%20Music%20Awards">"Billboard" Latin Music Awards</a>, and was named Best Album of the Year by the <a href="Association%20of%20Latin%20Entertainment%20Critics">Association of Latin Entertainment Critics</a>. Miguel was the Best-Selling Latin Artist of the Year at the 1995 <a href="World%20Music%20Awards">World Music Awards</a>.

"Segundo Romance" was released on 30 August 1994. Within two days, the album sold more than one million copies worldwide. In the United States, it debuted at number 29 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> the week of 10 September 1994, the highest debut on the chart at the time for a Spanish-language album. That week, "Segundo Romance" also debuted at number seven on the <a href="Top%20Latin%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Latin Albums</a> chart; it reached number one a week later, replacing <a href="Selena">Selena</a>'s "<a href="Amor%20Prohibido">Amor Prohibido</a>". It spent a total of 29 nonconsecutive weeks atop the chart, and was the second-bestselling Latin album of the year behind "<a href="Mi%20Tierra">Mi Tierra</a>" by <a href="Gloria%20Estefan">Gloria Estefan</a>. The album topped the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a> chart for 30 weeks, and was the highest-selling Latin pop album of the year in the U.S. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, the record has sold 603,000 copies in the US , making the 21st bestselling Latin album in the country. "Segundo Romance" was certified platinum for shipping one million copies, making Miguel the first Latin artist to have two certified platinum albums in the U.S. following "Romance".

The album was also successful in Spanish-speaking countries. It was certified quintuple platinum in Mexico, triple platinum in Paraguay and Uruguay as well as in Central America; double platinum in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Spain and Venezuela, and platinum in Ecuador. In Brazil, "Segundo Romance" was certified gold for sales of 50,000 copies. The album reached number one on the Chilean album charts, and was certified sextuple platinum for shipping 150,000 copies. In Argentina, it was certified 11× platinum and later received a diamond award for sales of 500,000 copies. By 1995, "Segundo Romance" had sold more than four million copies worldwide.

Like its predecessor, "Segundo Romance" helped to revive interest in bolero music. Mark Holston wrote that the album "proves again that the bolero is back, its heart beating as strongly as ever, its soul alive with tropical passion, a music for every time and all times". According to Enrique Lopetegui of the "Los Angeles Times", both albums "created a revival for the bolero—the old-fashioned, string-based romantic messages of <a href="unrequited%20love">unrequited love</a> were embraced even by young listeners". Ed Morales wrote in his book "The Latin Beat: The Rhythms and Roots of Latin Music from Bossa Nova to Salsa and Beyond": "Beyond merely being a revival, "Romance" and its 1994 follow-up, "Segundo Romance" was a significant update of the genre". "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" editor <a href="Achy%20Obejas">Achy Obejas</a> noted that the albums "scored in such unlikely places as Saudi Arabia and Finland". "Segundo Romance" was followed by two more bolero albums: "<a href="Romances%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romances</a>" (1997) and "<a href="Mis%20Romances">Mis Romances</a>" (2001). In 1998, "Romance", "Segundo Romance", and "Romances" were compiled on "<a href="Todos%20Los%20Romances">Todos Los Romances</a>", released by WEA Latina.

All tracks produced by Miguel, Manzanero, Calderón, and Cibrian.

Faces (Star Trek: Voyager)

"Faces" is an episode of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction television</a> series "". It is the 14th episode of the and was first broadcast by <a href="UPN">UPN</a> on May 8, 1995. "Faces" was developed from a story by <a href="Jonathan%20Glassner">Jonathan Glassner</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Biller">Kenneth Biller</a>. Biller wrote the teleplay, which was directed by <a href="Winrich%20Kolbe">Winrich Kolbe</a>. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> and <a href="Maquis%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Maquis</a> crew of the starship <a href="USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Voyager"</a> after they are stranded in the <a href="Delta%20Quadrant">Delta Quadrant</a>, far from the rest of the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a>.

In this episode, a <a href="Vidiian">Vidiian</a> scientist named Sulan (<a href="Brian%20Markinson">Brian Markinson</a>) captures and performs medical experiments on the half-<a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>, half-human <a href="B%27Elanna%20Torres">B'Elanna Torres</a> (<a href="Roxann%20Dawson">Roxann Dawson</a>). He separates her into a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human to find a cure for a disease. The "Voyager" crew rescues Torres and restores her to her original state, while she attempts to reconcile with her identity as a half-human half-Klingon. The episode guest stars Rob LaBelle as an unnamed Talaxian prisoner. Actress Joy Kilpatrick was cast as Dawson's <a href="photo%20double">photo double</a> to avoid a reliance on <a href="Split%20screen%20%28video%20production%29">split screen</a>.

The episode was developed as a character study to further explore Torres' internal struggle with her identity. Dawson was originally resistant to the episode, but later identified it as one of her favorite performances, which deepened her understanding of the character and strengthened her acting. Human Torres and Klingon Torres were treated as two separate characters during the development and filming of the episode. <a href="Michael%20Westmore">Michael Westmore</a> designed the characters' makeup to emphasize the differences between them. The episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 6.1/10 ratings share; a drop from the episode broadcast the previous week. "Faces" was generally well received, and Dawson's character and performance were praised. The episode has also been the subject of analysis on race. Its final sequence garnered negative reviews from critics and fans for the lack of empathy shown to Torres by the rest of "Voyager"'s crew.
Crew members <a href="Tom%20Paris">Tom Paris</a>, <a href="B%27Elanna%20Torres">B'Elanna Torres</a>, and Peter Durst have gone missing on a mission. They have been captured by the <a href="Vidiian">Vidiian</a>s. Vidiian Chief Surgeon Sulan has conducted a procedure on Torres, changing her from a half-human, half-Klingon hybrid into two bodies (a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human). He infects Klingon Torres with the Phage, a deadly disease that afflicts his species but to which Klingons have a natural immunity, so he can study her genetics. Commander <a href="Chakotay">Chakotay</a>, Security Chief <a href="Tuvok">Tuvok</a>, and Ensign <a href="Harry%20Kim%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Harry Kim</a> form a search party but are discovered by the Vidiians and <a href="Transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">beam back</a> to <a href="USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Voyager"</a>. Sulan examines the Klingon Torres while she experiences pain from the Phage. Klingon Torres expresses pride in her Klingon identity, though she remembers hiding her Klingon heritage as a child. Recognizing Sulan's attraction to her, she tries to seduce the scientist and escape, but his desire to find a cure overcomes his lust. The human version of Torres is kept imprisoned with Paris and Durst. Human Torres is characterized as weaker and more timid than her Klingon counterpart, and is deemed too ill to work in the mines. She secretly works on a security console in the barracks in an attempt to contact "Voyager" but is caught.

Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts his face over his own to appear more appealing to the Klingon Torres. Klingon Torres escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from <a href="Starfleet%20Academy">Starfleet Academy</a>, the two halves formulate a plan. Human Torres suggests shutting down the <a href="Shields%20%28Star%20Trek%29">shields</a> for the complex so that "Voyager" can transport them to the ship, while the Klingon Torres deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard with the help of , breaks into the facility at the same time Torres deactivates the shields. Klingon Torres sacrifices herself to protect the rest of the crew members from Sulan. Transported back to "Voyager", Klingon Torres refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human Torres would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating the Klingon DNA. Human Torres admits to feeling incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with her inner conflict.

"Faces" was pitched by writer <a href="Jonathan%20Glassner">Jonathan Glassner</a>, and was later revised by executive story editor <a href="Kenneth%20Biller">Kenneth Biller</a>. In an interview with "The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine", Biller said that the only similarity between the original pitch and the final copy was that the episode deals with the character B'Elanna Torres being split into two parts. In the episode's first draft, aliens used a machine to separate Torres into human and Klingon halves as part of an experiment attempting to achieve purity within a species. Executive producer <a href="Michael%20Piller">Michael Piller</a> described the draft as originally focusing on "somebody's idea that this could be the result of a hideous concentration-camp kind of experiment, that is, genetic demonstration of some sort."

Biller and executive producer <a href="Jeri%20Taylor">Jeri Taylor</a> were critical of Glassner's pitch; Biller found it to be "very melodramatic and hokey", and Taylor called it "a tired idea" and "too on the nose for B'Elanna." Producer <a href="Brannon%20Braga">Brannon Braga</a> explained that the decision to purchase the concept was to do a storyline involving an <a href="evil%20twin">evil twin</a> in the show's first season, and "get it out of the way." He did feel that the concept could be a mistake, and compared it negatively to a hypothetical storyline in which "" character <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a> (<a href="Brent%20Spiner">Brent Spiner</a>) would be made human. Piller said the episode was almost abandoned, but he believed that the conflict between Torres' human and Klingon halves, and her identity as a woman, would make a worthwhile storyline.

The series' writing team expressed concern that the episode would be compared to two episodes from "" ("" and "<a href="The%20Alternative%20Factor">The Alternative Factor</a>"). Piller added: "[w]e knew we could not do the evil-versus-good story that the original "Star Trek" had done." Biller was assigned to write the script as his second writing assignment for the series; his first had been for "<a href="Elogium">Elogium</a>". Biller attributed his interest in the episode's concept to his personal experiences with his younger, adopted brother's struggle to understand his biracial identity. Even though Biller was initially critical of the pitch's melodrama, he felt that his version had the melodrama expected of a "Star Trek" episode. The final draft of the script was submitted on February 24, 1995.

Biller incorporated the Vidiians into the episode, believing that their technology would present a conceivable method by which Torres could be separated. The Vidiians were featured in an earlier season one episode titled "". Biller explained that Klingons were shown to be more resistant to disease than other species in previous "Star Trek" installments, and reasoned that a Vidiians scientist would view them as a promising way to discover a cure for the disease. Biller said that he had difficulty writing Sulan as a sympathetic villain. He looked to <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s approach to portraying antagonists in the "Star Trek" franchise: "[A]liens should never be patently evil. They may have a set of values that differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains."

Biller viewed the interactions between Sulan and the Klingon version of Torres as being inspired by the fairy tale "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast">Beauty and the Beast</a>". He considered a Klingon's strength to be the ideal beauty for a Vidiian, and that Sulan would develop an attraction to Torres. Biller said that the Klingon version of Torres was more manipulative than Beauty from the fairy tale because she uses her sexuality to convince Sulan to follow her demands. Biller believed the episode added more elements of horror to the series, and pointed to the moment when Sulan grafted Durst's face over his own as a "sick moment of inspiration" and a "classic horror movie moment". He felt that Sulan's discomfort with his appearance helped round out his character.

<a href="Brian%20Markinson">Brian Markinson</a> was cast as Sulan, the episode's primary antagonist. Owing to the sequence in which Sulan attaches Durst's face to his own, Markinson was also given the role of Durst. The character was introduced in the preceding episode ("") so that he would be a familiar face to the viewers. Rob LaBelle, who was a close friend of Biller, was cast as an unnamed <a href="Talaxian">Talaxian</a> prisoner but he concealed the connection during his audition to avoid preferential treatment. LaBelle later appeared in the series as the Takarian servant Kafar in "<a href="False%20Profits">False Profits</a>" and Talaxian settler Oxilon in "".

Because of budgetary concerns, "Faces" was produced near the end of the first season. It was originally going to be set in a jungle, but the location was changed to caves after director <a href="Winrich%20Kolbe">Winrich Kolbe</a> calculated that the former idea would exceed the episode's budget. "Faces" was the fourth episode of the series Kolbe directed, and he said that everything ran smoothly despite his lack of familiarity with the story arcs and characters. The sets for the Vidiian mines were constructed on Paramount Stage 18. Materials used to create security consoles in the Vidiian laboratories were previously used for the construction of <a href="Klingon%20starships">Klingon starships</a>. The prosthetics and make-up for the Vidiians were handled by make-up supervisor <a href="Michael%20Westmore">Michael Westmore</a>. The episode (with the rest of the first season) earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for the <a href="47th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">47th Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, but lost to "".

Cast members have commented on their performances in the episode. <a href="Robert%20Beltran">Robert Beltran</a>, who played Commander Chakotay, said he felt uncomfortable acting in the facial mask worn for his character's Vidiian disguise. He described the prosthetics as "that raw, wounded face, which made me feel very vulnerable as a person", and viewed it as an acting challenge. <a href="Garrett%20Wang">Garrett Wang</a>, who portrayed Ensign Harry Kim, said that his role in the episode was restricted to <a href="technobabble">technobabble</a>. <a href="Robert%20Picardo">Robert Picardo</a>, who played the Doctor, appreciated the interactions between Torres and his character as they represented how he was originally "just a functionary doing his job." Picardo added that his scenes showed that it was too soon for his character to understand the importance of his operation on Torres, or to develop any sort of relationship with her.

Various <a href="blooper">blooper</a>s occurred during the filming of the episode. The first take of a scene in which Chakotay, Tuvok, and Kim encounter two Vidiians was interrupted when Beltran forgot his line and improvised a joke about the aliens' appearance. Kolbe was dissatisfied with several of the following takes and told the actors to "put a little acting into this one, please". During another sequence, <a href="Nana%20Visitor">Nana Visitor</a>, who played <a href="Kira%20Nerys">Kira Nerys</a> in "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", walked on set by accident.

Actress Roxann Dawson was initially doubtful about the script, believing that the concept was occurring too early in the series for her to understand the character well enough to play two separate people. She said that she physically shook when reading the script for the first time, and found the episode an acting challenge that broadened her abilities and deepened her connection with the character. Dawson said: "I was able to delineate these two sides that up until then were just metaphors." She reasoned that the episode provided an opportunity "to personify two aspects of this character".

Dawson was given two versions of the script, one labeled "The Klingon" and the other "The Human". The scripts treated the human and Klingon forms of Torres as two separate characters, emphasizing their flaws. Dawson observed that Human Torres lacked strength and courage, while Klingon Torres lacked logic and control. She felt that the Klingon should receive more attention, especially when Torres struggles with that side of her identity throughout the series. She also wanted the episode to capture Klingon Torres' respect for Human Torres. Dawson added that the episode's central theme was "learning to respect the parts of one's self that make up the whole person". "Faces" was noted for establishing Torres' ongoing inability to reconcile her human and Klingon identities, in "the most literal battle". Biller disagreed with the episode's resolution, arguing that Torres should remain human. He felt that the episode should have a longer impact on Torres' character development, and believed: "[w]e couldn't get to the end of the episode and say that Torres has now resolved all her issues and is at peace with herself". This story arc continued in the later episodes "<a href="Day%20of%20Honor">Day of Honor</a>" and "", in which Torres eventually accepted her Klingon heritage.

Actress Joy Kilpatrick was cast as Dawson's <a href="photo%20double">photo double</a>. Dawson described having a great working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, "I was about to tell her what I was going to be doing so she could give me the beats that I could react to properly" and found her to be supportive and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe to avoid relying on <a href="Split%20screen%20%28video%20production%29">split screen</a>. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.

Dawson described the prosthetics for the Klingon version of Torres as "a forehead, nose, and teeth". She felt that the look was not as sophisticated as the character's normal appearance as a half-human/half-Klingon because of the lack of skin tones and nuances of the facial features. While Dawson's make-up typically took two hours to apply, the full Klingon prosthetics took around three hours. To save time reapplying the make-up and prosthetics repeatedly, each day's shooting would concentrate on one of the two characters, and switch the following day. Dawson compared the experience to <a href="repertory%20theatre">repertory theatre</a>. Despite the casting of the photo double, and attention to scheduling, Kolbe expressed disappointment in not being able to shoot more scenes with the two versions of Torres in the cave, but understood the frequent use of the split screen could negatively impact the production cost. After the episode had aired, Dawson called her parents to ask their opinions. They replied: "[y]ou were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!" Dawson took their remarks as a compliment.

"Faces" was first broadcast on May 8, 1995, on <a href="UPN">UPN</a> at 8 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> in the United States. The episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 6.1/10 ratings share; this placed it in 77th place overall for the week. This marked a drop in viewership compared to the previous episode "Cathexis", which had earned a 6.4 rating.

The episode was first released for home media use on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in the United Kingdom in 1995 as part of a two-episode collection with "Cathexis". This was followed by a release in the United Kingdom in 1996, which was re-released the following year. It was first released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> as part of the first season release on February 24, 2004, in the United States. The episode was also available on numerous <a href="Media%20streaming">streaming</a> <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> services, such as <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a>, <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>, and <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>.

The episode was positively received by the cast and crew for its representation of Torres' internal conflict over her half-human, half-Klingon identity. Biller identified the episode as his favorite of the three scripts he wrote for the show's first season; he also wrote "Elogium" and "<a href="Jetrel">Jetrel</a>". He viewed the scene depicting Torres' realization that she was human as one of the best from the episode. Dawson described the episode as a "very big step for B'Elanna" and appreciated that the script avoided a cliché ending by leaving room for Torres to deal with her internal identity struggles. Towards the end of "Voyager"s final season, she looked back on the episode as one of the show's highlights. Taylor and Beltran praised Dawson for her ability to play two contrasting characters; Beltran added that it was a great episode that showcased Dawson's abilities as an actor. While Kolbe initially found Dawson's inquisitiveness and frequent questions during filming to be a challenge, he felt that she did "a hell of a job on that one". He enjoyed the completed version of the episode, but expressed disappointment with its ending.

The producers and writers also commented on the appearance of the Vidiians in the episode. Piller, Braga, and Taylor praised executive producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a>'s decision to reformat Torres' storyline with the inclusion of the Vidiians. Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians for "Phage" was impressed by the episode's representation of the alien species, and felt it was an improvement over her concepts. Biller highlighted the scene revealing Sulan's transplant of Durst's face onto his own as "my classic moment in "Voyager" first season".

The critical response for "Faces" was largely positive, Dawson's performance and Torres' characterization being praised as the episode's highlights. Will Nguyen of Treknews.net identified "Faces" as a positive development for Torres that enabled the audience to better understand her character. It was chosen as one of three episodes to watch from the first season by Juliette Harrisson at "<a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>" due to "some fine character work from Roxann Dawson." Harrisson noted that the episode helped to establish ""Voyager"'s most successful romantic pairing" (Torres and Paris). <a href="TrekNation">"TrekToday"</a>'s Michelle Erica Green felt that the episode was an effective character study of Torres and showcased Dawson's abilities as an actor. Green nevertheless considered the plot an unoriginal take on the evil twin storyline and found the science unbelievable in the context of the show. "Faces" was described as a standout from the show's first season by Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer's Reviews given that it did not recycle its story from "Star Trek: The Next Generation". He praised Dawson's performance, and expressed disappointment that the character was frequently restricted to technobabble throughout the rest of the series.

Critics and fans responded negatively to the episode's final sequence. Taylor described getting adverse fan mail about the lack of sympathy expressed by "Voyager"'s crew members for Torres in the ending. She clarified that Chakotay's response to Torres was intended to be unresponsive rather than cold, and acknowledged that he should have "put his arm around her and show[n] some warmth" as suggested by fans. Green was surprised that Torres was not given a pep talk by either Captain <a href="Kathryn%20Janeway">Kathryn Janeway</a> (<a href="Kate%20Mulgrew">Kate Mulgrew</a>) or Chakotay in the final scene. Epsicokhan, on the other hand, found the lack of answers from Chakotay to be an appropriate ending given the focus on Torres' personal conflicts.

The character of Torres has been the subject of racial analysis. In her article "The Monster Inside: 19th Century Racial Constructs in the 24th Century Mythos of Star Trek", Denise Alessandria Hurd wrote that "Faces" demonstrated that Torres was developed according to the <a href="tragic%20mulatto">tragic mulatto</a> archetype. Hurd pointed out that Human Torres looked like "a poster child for the cult of white womanhood", while Klingon Torres had more stereotypical African-American features, such as dark skin and kinky hair. Torres' final statement that she will always experience internal conflict was identified as a marker of mental instability by Hurd, who felt such behavior was normalized in hybrid characters. Allen Kwan also cited the episode's final scene as a negative commentary on race in his article "Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise". He wrote that Torres' desire to be completely human was a "tacit acknowledgement of the racial normativity inherent to Starfleet and the Federation".

Susan De Gaia argued in her article "Intergalactic Heroines: Land, Body and Soul in "Star Trek: Voyager"" that the separation of Torres into her Klingon and human halves positively addressed diversity. De Gaia felt that the episode communicated that "a strong woman is created by incorporating the human with a stronger race, the Klingon, and by affiliation with an independent group". In her book "American Science Fiction TV: Star Trek, Stargate and Beyond", Jan Johnson-Smith categorized "Faces" as one instance in which the "Star Trek" franchise has tackled "[i]ssues of individual difference" and compared it to the combining of Tuvok and <a href="Neelix">Neelix</a> (<a href="Ethan%20Phillips">Ethan Phillips</a>) in the second-season episode "<a href="Tuvix">Tuvix</a>". Elisabeth Anne Leonard also discussed Torres' epiphany about her identity in her book "Into Darkness Peering: Race and Color in the Fantastic". Leonard wrote that the ending of "Faces" acts as Torres' "acceptance of a <a href="Creole%20peoples">Creole</a> self" as opposed to her "incipient destruction of a Creole identity" in the episode "".

In the chapter "Femme Noire" from the book "Goddesses and Monsters: Women, Myth, Power, and Popular Culture", Jane Caputi and Lauri Sagle called "Faces" one of the "more thoughtful Virgin/Cannibal narrative structures"—a literary device that they invented and defined as "push[ing] the envelope of the classic <a href="Madonna%E2%80%93whore%20complex">virgin/whore paradigm</a>". Caputi and Sagle approached the episode as a "metaphorical tale of <a href="Mestizo">"mestiza"</a> experience and conscious" given Torres' Spanish last name. They connected the character's difficulty with her identity to <a href="Gloria%20E.%20Anzald%C3%BAa">Gloria E. Anzaldúa</a>'s theoretical work, interpreting Torres as crafting a new "inner and outer face" for herself.

No. 33 Squadron RAAF

No. 33 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) strategic transport and <a href="aerial%20refueling">air-to-air refuelling</a> squadron. It operates <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports</a> from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War II, operating <a href="Short%20Empire">Short Empire</a> flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakota</a> transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.

The unit was re-established in February 1981 as a <a href="flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a>, equipped with two <a href="Boeing%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B707">Boeing 707</a>s for <a href="Very%20Important%20Person">VIP</a> and other long-range transport duties out of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales. No. 33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No. 33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved <a href="initial%20operating%20capability">initial operating capability</a> with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="2014%20military%20intervention%20against%20ISIS">military coalition against ISIS</a>.

No. 33 Squadron is responsible for <a href="aerial%20refueling">aerial refuelling</a> and long-range transport. It is located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, and controlled by <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Mobility%20Group%20RAAF">Air Mobility Group</a>. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier maintenance is conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services (formerly <a href="Qantas%20Defence%20Services">Qantas Defence Services</a>).

The squadron operates five <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports</a>, the first of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a <a href="Force%20multiplication">force multiplier</a>, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and <a href="Loiter%20%28flight%29">loiter time</a> of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more <a href="Aircraft%20ordnance">ordnance</a> than they might otherwise.

The KC-30 can carry up to 100 tonnes of fuel. Its dual delivery systems—probe-and-drogue in the wings and boom under the tail—are designed to refuel the RAAF's <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> and <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18%20Super%20Hornet">Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet</a> multi-role fighters, <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a> heavy airlifters, <a href="Boeing%20737%20AEW%26amp%3BC">Boeing E-7 Wedgetail</a> early warning aircraft, or other KC-30s. The tanker is also capable of refuelling future acquisitions including the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II</a> stealth fighter, the <a href="Boeing%20EA-18G%20Growler">Boeing EA-18G Growler</a> electronic warfare aircraft, and the <a href="Boeing%20P-8A%20Poseidon">Boeing P-8A Poseidon</a> maritime patrol aircraft. In its transport configuration, the KC-30 can carry 270 passengers or 40 tonnes of cargo. As well as its aircraft, No. 33 Squadron operates a simulator at Amberley.

During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, <a href="No.%2034%20Squadron%20RAAF">34</a>, <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAAF">35</a> and <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">36 Squadrons</a>. No. 33 Squadron was established on 16 February at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, under the control of <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area Command</a>. It was equipped with four ex-<a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> <a href="Short%20Empire">Short Empire</a> flying boats transferred from <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 11 Squadron</a>, along with several smaller types including <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon">de Havilland Dragon</a>s and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moth</a>s, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, and <a href="Stinson%20L-1%20Vigilant">Vultee Vigilant</a>s. The squadron suffered its first loss on 27 February, when one of the Empires crashed on landing at Townsville; the six crew members were killed. A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a <a href="Attack%20on%20Broome">Japanese air attack on Broome</a>, Western Australia, on 3 March; another Empire was impressed from Qantas to replace the lost aircraft. Two months later the commanding officer, Squadron Leader <a href="Charles%20Raymond%20Gurney">Charles Gurney</a>, was killed in a crash. One of the squadron's tasks was search-and-rescue; it lost another Empire on 8 August 1942, when it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed ship.

No. 33 Squadron transferred to <a href="Port%20Moresby%20Airfield%20Complex">Port Moresby</a> in January 1943, providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed, delivering a total of per trip. In September–October 1943, the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a> to replace its assortment of aircraft. By the time it transferred to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> on 1 January 1944, it was operating Dakotas exclusively, and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The squadron relocated to <a href="Lae%20Airfield">Lae</a> on 15 January 1945. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. No. 33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11 March 1946, and disbanded there on 13 May.

In 1978, the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying <a href="Very%20Important%20Person">VIPs</a> on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one <a href="Boeing%20727">Boeing 727</a> each from domestic carriers <a href="Ansett%20Australia">Ansett</a> and <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">TAA</a> were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers. The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22 April. Located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 37 Squadron</a>. They were formed into No. 33 Flight under the command of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> J.D. Grierson on 2 February 1981. The <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight's</a> first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a>, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.
On 1 July 1983, after the government procured two more 707s for $7.5 million from <a href="Worldways%20Canada">Worldways Canada</a>, No. 33 Flight was reorganised as No. 33 Squadron under Grierson's command. Responsible for transporting VIPs such as members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a>, the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>, and the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>, the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the occasion being the funeral of <a href="Konstantin%20Chernenko">Konstantin Chernenko</a> in 1985. Along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, operating <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a>, No. 33 Squadron came under the control of No. 86 Wing, part of the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), in February 1987. Routine servicing of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of <a href="No.%20486%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 486 Squadron</a>, another component of No. 86 Wing. Qantas undertook heavier maintenance of the 707s at its jet base in <a href="Sydney%20Airport">Mascot</a>. The RAAF acquired three more 707s on 25 February 1988, following a $25 million purchase from <a href="Boeing%20Defense%2C%20Space%20%26amp%3B%20Security">Boeing Military</a>. One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed "Hulksbury".

A consortium of <a href="Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries">Israel Aerospace Industries</a> and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Australia">Hawker de Havilland</a> converted four of No. 33 Squadron's six serviceable aircraft to in-flight refuelling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992. Their probe-and-drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets and the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>'s <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">Douglas A-4K Skyhawks</a>, but not the RAAF's <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111</a> bombers, which required a boom system; the other two 707s continued to be used purely for long-range transport. The RAAF had argued for an air-to-air refuelling capability for both the and the , but the Australian government refused to fund the latter, considering the F-111's existing range sufficient for deterrent purposes. Observers such as journalist Frank Cranston speculated that aside from any cost issues, the government was concerned that extending the bombers' range would signal to the region that Australia was adopting a more aggressive defence posture.
In April 1989, one of the 707s transported 300 <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> personnel in two flights to Namibia as part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20UNTAG">Australian contribution to UNTAG</a>, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when <a href="1989%20Australian%20pilots%27%20strike">the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute</a>; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of <a href="Compass%20Airlines%20%28Australia%29">Compass Airlines</a>. On 29 October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">East Sale</a>, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No. 33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of <a href="Operation%20Solace">Operation Solace</a> in 1993.

In January 1998, still based at Richmond, No. 33 Squadron joined <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 32</a> and 34 Squadrons under <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a>. Two of No. 33 Squadron's aircraft were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait, as part of <a href="Operation%20Southern%20Watch">Operation Southern Watch</a>. On 5 March, one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron's re-formation in 1983, when it refuelled six <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Panavia Tornado</a>s of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) over Saudi Arabia. The detachment subsequently refuelled US F/A-18 Hornets, <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20EA-6B%20Prowler">Northrop Grumman EA-6 Prowlers</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20AV-8B%20Harrier%20II">McDonnell Douglas AV-8 Harriers</a>, and RAF <a href="British%20Aerospace%20Harrier%20II">British Aerospace Harriers</a>, as well as the Tornados. From March to September 2002, two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of <a href="Operation%20Slipper">Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan</a>. Located at <a href="Transit%20Center%20at%20Manas">Manas Air Base</a> in <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre, their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a <a href="Meritorious%20Unit%20Citation">Meritorious Unit Citation</a>.

By the mid-1990s, the ageing 707s carrying Australian VIPs overseas were no longer compliant with foreign noise and emission regulations. No. 33 Squadron relinquished its VIP transport role in 2002, following the entry into service of No. 34 Squadron's <a href="Boeing%20Business%20Jet">Boeing 737 Business Jets</a> and <a href="Bombardier%20Challenger%20604">Bombardier Challenger 604</a>s. The squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> in May 2007, "in recognition of its high levels of proficiency demonstrated over the year" in spite of the challenges of operating the obsolescent 707s, and for having "performed superbly on a number of high-profile missions". The 707s were retired in 2008, bringing to an end the 29-year operational history of the type in the RAAF. The last one in service, an ex-Qantas jet named "Richmond Town", made a low-level farewell flight over <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 30 June in the company of smaller aircraft filming the occasion, which gave rise to fear in some quarters that a <a href="September%2011%20attacks">9/11</a>-style terrorist attack was in progress. Three 707s remained at Richmond until 2011, when they were flown out by their new operator, the US-based <a href="Omega%20Aerial%20Refueling%20Services">Omega Air Services</a>; Omega also procured the RAAF's Boeing simulator, which had been operated by <a href="No.%20285%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 285 Squadron</a>.

Following the retirement of the Boeing 707, No. 33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1 July 2008. It was presented with a <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">Squadron Standard</a> by Queensland Governor <a href="Penelope%20Wensley">Penelope Wensley</a> on 2 June 2010, to commemorate "25 years of faithful and outstanding service". Having been without aircraft for three years, the squadron began re-equipping with the first of five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1 June 2011. The KC-30 could carry one-and-a-half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe-and-drogue and boom delivery systems. These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008, and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> and Omega Air to meet its aerial refuelling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the boom system and completed essential technical documentation. In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record for the number of passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft, 220 cadets from the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy">Australian Defence Force Academy</a>.
The squadron received its fifth KC-30 on 3 December 2012, and achieved <a href="initial%20operating%20capability">initial operating capability</a> in February 2013. It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14 September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to <a href="Al%20Minhad%20Air%20Base">Al Minhad Air Base</a> in the United Arab Emirates, as part of a <a href="2014%20military%20intervention%20against%20ISIS">coalition</a> to combat <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State</a> forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1 October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13 May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s, taking No. 33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas <a href="Airbus%20A330">A330-200</a> passenger liners, converted by <a href="Airbus%20Defence%20and%20Space">Airbus Defence and Space</a> at <a href="Getafe">Getafe</a>, near <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No. 33 Squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Duke of Gloucester Cup</a> as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy. The unit's sixth KC-30 was delivered to Amberley in September 2017; the seventh and last aircraft is due to arrive in 2019, and will have a VIP passenger-carrying capability augmenting its aerial refuelling role.

No. 34 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Very%20important%20person">VIP</a> transport <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a>. It operates <a href="Boeing%20Business%20Jet">Boeing 737 Business Jets</a> and <a href="Bombardier%20Challenger%20600">Bombardier Challenger 604s</a> from <a href="Defence%20Establishment%20Fairbairn">Defence Establishment Fairbairn</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for standard transport duties during World War II, initially flying <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon">de Havilland DH.84 Dragons</a> in Northern Australia. In 1943 it re-equipped with <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>, which it operated in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> prior to disbanding in June 1946.

The unit was re-established in March 1948 as No. 34 (Communications) Squadron at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Mallala">RAAF Station Mallala</a>, South Australia, where it supported activities at the <a href="Woomera%20Test%20Range">Woomera Rocket Range</a> before disbanding in October 1955. It was re-raised as No. 34 (VIP) Flight in March 1956 at RAAF Base Canberra (later Fairbairn). No. 34 Flight was redesignated No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron in July 1959, and No. 34 Squadron in June 1963. During the 1960s it operated Dakotas, <a href="Convair%20CV-240%20family">Convair Metropolitans</a>, <a href="Vickers%20Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a>s, <a href="Dassault%20Falcon%2020">Dassault Falcon-Mysteres</a>, <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20HS%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B748">Hawker Siddeley HS 748</a>s, and <a href="BAC%20One-Eleven">BAC 1-11s</a>, the last three types continuing in service until the late 1980s. The squadron's fleet consisted solely of <a href="Dassault%20Falcon%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B900">Dassault Falcon 900</a>s from 1989 until 2002, when it began operating the 737 and Challenger.

No. 34 Squadron is the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) unit responsible for the transport of <a href="Very%20important%20person">VIPs</a>, including members of the Australian government, the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, and visiting dignitaries. It is based at <a href="Defence%20Establishment%20Fairbairn">Defence Establishment Fairbairn</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, and administered by <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Mobility%20Group%20RAAF">Air Mobility Group</a>. The squadron has a secondary role providing emergency transport during humanitarian operations. Its motto is "Eo et redeo" ("I Go and I Return").

As of 2011, No. 34 Squadron's strength included around thirty pilots and thirty flight attendants. Captains are generally senior pilots who have previously flown the RAAF's <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III%20in%20Australian%20service">Boeing C-17 Globemaster</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules%20in%20Australian%20service">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a>, or <a href="Lockheed%20AP-3C%20Orion">Lockheed AP-3C Orion</a>. Their co-pilots are new RAAF personnel who have recently graduated from <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Flying Training School</a>, and the crew attendants are posted to the squadron after completing training and a period of service with <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a>. The squadron's VIP Operations Cell (VIPOPS) is responsible for managing requests for VIP air transport as well as dedicated security staff. Most logistical support, including meal preparation, is provided under commercial arrangements rather than by RAAF personnel.

No. 34 Squadron operates two <a href="Boeing%20Business%20Jet">Boeing 737 Business Jets</a> and three <a href="Bombardier%20Challenger%20600">Bombardier Challenger 604s</a>. The aircraft are leased from, and maintained by, the Special Purpose Aircraft Business Unit of <a href="Qantas%20Defence%20Services">Qantas Defence Services</a> in Fairbairn. The lease commenced in 2002 and is due to expire in 2014. The twin-engined Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is crewed by two pilots and up to four flight attendants, and can carry thirty passengers. The twinjet Challenger has a crew of two pilots and one flight attendant, and carries up to nine passengers. The BBJ, which has a range of over , is generally used for long-range transport, and the Challenger on shorter routes. The jets are classified as "Special Purpose Aircraft", meaning that their tasking is governed by Federal guidelines for carrying "entitled persons" on official business. To minimise government outlay, the jets may not be employed when available commercial flights satisfy the timing, location and security requirements of a given task. No. 34 Squadron conducts between 1,200 and 1,800 flights each year. A "Schedule of Special Purpose Flights" is tabled twice annually in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a>. VIPOPS usually assigns one of No. 34 Squadron's aircraft to approved tasks, but other <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> aircraft are occasionally used for tasks not suited to the BBJ or Challenger; for instance, Prime Minister <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a> travelled to China on board a No. 33 Squadron <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport</a> in April 2013.

During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, 34, <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAAF">35</a> and <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">36 Squadrons</a>. No. 34 (Transport) Squadron was established on 23 February at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Station Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, four days after <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">the city was bombed</a> for the first time. Coming under the control of <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a>, the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon">de Havilland DH.84 Dragons</a>. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2 March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at <a href="Wyndham%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wyndham</a>, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to <a href="Daly%20Waters%20Airfield">Daly Waters Airfield</a> on 5 March. On 14 March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s and two <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a>s in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a>. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1 July, a few days after the plane crashlanded south of <a href="Katherine%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Katherine</a>. The squadron relocated again on 15 July, this time to <a href="Hughes%20Airfield">Hughes Airfield</a>. It remained at Hughes until 27 August, when it transferred to <a href="Manbulloo%20Airfield">Manbulloo Airfield</a>; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13 December and its aircraft transferred to No. 6 Communications Flight.

No. 34 Squadron was re-formed on 3 January 1943 at <a href="Parafield%20Airport">Parafield Airport</a>, South Australia, from elements of No. 36 Squadron formerly based at <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a>, Victoria. Initially comprising ninety-six personnel and eight aircraft, by the end of the month the squadron's strength had been reduced to seventy personnel and three Dragons operating in South Australia and the Northern Territory. On 11 March one of the Dragons was destroyed on takeoff at Parafield, causing two deaths—No. 34 Squadron's first fatalities. Another Dragon was lost in a fire after it crashlanded near <a href="Tennant%20Creek">Tennant Creek</a> in April. Beginning in May 1943, the Dragons were augmented by <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>, giving the squadron a total strength of three Dakotas and two Dragons by the following month. By July, No. 34 Squadron was operating five Dakotas, which had fully replaced the Dragons, and in August its strength stood at seven Dakotas and 153 personnel, including forty-seven officers. It subsequently received an <a href="Airspeed%20Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a> and a <a href="Douglas%20DC-2">Douglas DC-2</a>, and began making supply drops and medical evacuations as far north as <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea. The squadron had its busiest month in May 1944, transporting almost 1,900 passengers and over of cargo. On 1 June it became the first operational RAAF squadron to have personnel of the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF) in its ranks, a contingent made up of an officer and twenty airwomen. The WAAAF had been formed in 1941 and eventually made up thirty-one per cent of RAAF ground staff; its members were primarily employed in technical trades and were not permitted to serve in combat theatres.
October 1944 saw a detachment of the squadron operating from <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a> to bases in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Additional detachments were located at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, and <a href="Coomalie%20Shire">Coomalie Creek</a>, Northern Territory. In February 1945, No. 34 Squadron commenced a relocation to <a href="Leo%20Wattimena%20Airport">Morotai</a> in the Dutch East Indies, under the control of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a>, and was fully established at its new base by mid-April. The squadron supported the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">invasion of Borneo</a>, and its Dakotas were the first Allied aircraft to land at <a href="Timbalai%20Airfield">Labuan</a> and <a href="Juwata%20International%20Airport">Tarakan</a> after the islands were captured. It remained at Morotai until the end of the war, at which time it became involved in repatriating Australian former prisoners of war from Singapore, and then in courier flights supporting the formation of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan. No. 34 Squadron returned to Australia between January and March 1946 and disbanded at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, on 6 June.

The squadron was re-established at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Mallala">RAAF Station Mallala</a>, South Australia, on 1 March 1948, when No. 2 (Communications) Squadron was renamed No. 34 (Communications) Squadron. It operated as a VIP transport, courier and reconnaissance unit, primarily in support of the <a href="Woomera%20Test%20Range">Woomera rocket range</a>, focal point of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. No. 34 (Communications) Squadron flew the only <a href="Vickers_VC.1_Viking">Vickers Viking</a> to be taken on strength by the RAAF, and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the <a href="Bristol%20Freighter">Bristol Freighter</a>. Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949, and a fourth in September 1951; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25 November 1953 after its wing failed in flight. The squadron also operated <a href="Percival%20Prince">Percival Prince</a>, <a href="Auster">Auster</a>, Dakota and Anson aircraft, undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support work before disbanding at Mallala on 28 October 1955.

No. 34 (VIP) Flight was established at RAAF Base Canberra on 12 March 1956, and charged with the safe carriage of the Governor-General, senior Australian politicians and military officers, and visiting foreign dignitaries. It was formed from the VIP Flight of No. 36 Squadron, under <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Transport) Wing</a>. The VIP Flight had absorbed the RAAF's <a href="Governor-General%27s%20Flight%20RAAF">Governor-General's Flight</a> in October 1950. In its first year of operation, No. 34 Flight carried the <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> on his tour of Australia. It was equipped with two <a href="Convair%20CV-240">Convair 440 Metropolitans</a>, as well as Dakotas. The flight remained in Canberra when No. 86 Wing relocated to Richmond in 1958. On 1 July 1959, it was re-formed as No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron, leaving the control of No. 86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home Command</a> and tasked by RAAF Base Canberra. "Possibly because of the rank of its clients", contended the official history of the post-war Air Force, the squadron maintained higher standards than other transport units, adopting some procedures from the civil aviation world. It also benefitted from the personal interest of senior officials when it came to upgrading its equipment, though this had some negative aspects. The acquisition of the Metropolitans, the first pressurised aircraft in the VIP fleet, was organised by Minister for Air <a href="Athol%20Townley">Athol Townley</a> without any advance discussion with the RAAF. Although the Air Force raised performance and safety concerns, the type's entry into service was a "fait accompli", and it remained on strength for twelve years. Until the early 1960s, the VIP unit also operated two <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jets and two <a href="CAC%20Winjeel">CAC Winjeel</a> trainers to allow staff officers at Canberra's <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a> to maintain their flying proficiency.

No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron's home in Canberra was renamed RAAF Base Fairbairn in March 1962, and the unit was redesignated No. 34 Squadron on 13 June 1963. That year, the squadron carried <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> for the first time. In October 1964, two second-hand <a href="Vickers%20Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a> turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and Convairs; the two <a href="piston-engine">piston-engine</a> types were withdrawn after the delivery of two <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20HS%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B748">Hawker Siddeley HS 748</a>s beginning in April 1967 and three <a href="Dassault%20Falcon%2020">Dassault Falcon 20</a> jets (known as Mystere in RAAF service) in June. Two <a href="BAC%20One-Eleven">BAC 1-11</a> jets joined the squadron on 19 January 1968, and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year. The wholesale re-equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial, and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations. The so-called "VIP affair" led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron's tasking, requiring approval for flights to be made by the British Royal Family, the Governor-General, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>, or the Minister for Air. Eligibility criteria were also codified, and potential passengers included Federal ministers, opposition leaders, "individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia", two-star officers and above, and other dignitaries of similar status. During the 1970s one of No. 34 Squadron's BAC 1-11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> to New Zealand. The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia, but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four-engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over-water legs. The government eventually purchased two <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>s from <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> to perform long-range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF's strategic transport capabilities. Entering service in 1979, they joined the newly established No. 33 Flight (later No. 33 Squadron) in 1981. More 707s were acquired between 1983 and 1988, and four were converted for <a href="aerial%20refueling">air-to-air refuelling</a> in the early 1990s. In 1984, No. 34 Squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> for its proficiency.
The squadron again became part of No. 86 Wing in June 1988, though its tasking continued to be controlled by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. Commencing in September 1989, the twinjet Mysteres and BAC 1-11s were replaced by five trijet <a href="Dassault%20Falcon%20900">Dassault Falcon 900</a>s leased from <a href="de%20Havilland%20Australia">Hawker Pacific</a>, the first time the RAAF had leased aircraft from a commercial company. The two HS 748s were transferred to the newly formed <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 32 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a>, Victoria. Responsibility for servicing the Falcon 900s was shared by No. 34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific, the latter performing heavy maintenance. In an unusual operation for the squadron, one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to evacuate thirteen Australian citizens who had been held hostage in Iraq. On 21 December 1992, a Falcon 900 became the first RAAF aircraft to take part in <a href="Operation%20Solace">United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Somalia</a>, when it departed <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, with a team of <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> personnel to reconnoitre the theatre of operations. The unit received a commendation from the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>, General <a href="Peter%20Gration">Peter Gration</a>, shortly before his retirement in 1993. In January 1998, No. 84 Wing was organised as a special transport wing under Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). The term "special transport" referred to activities not directly related to army support, such as carrying VIPs. Headquartered at Richmond, No. 84 Wing took control of Nos. 32, 33 and 34 Squadrons. A flight by one of No. 34 Squadron's Falcons preceded <a href="Operation%20Warden">INTERFET operations in East Timor</a> in 1999, carrying senior Australian military and diplomatic staff to <a href="Dili">Dili</a> on a goodwill mission.
The Falcon 900s were replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002. The new aircraft also replaced the two Boeing 707s operated by No. 33 Squadron in the VIP transport role. The 707s had permitted journalists to travel with the Prime Minister on international flights, and in replacing the bigger jets with 737s the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> government of the time determined that media contingents covering VIP trips should travel on civil aircraft. This decision led to controversy in 2007, after the <a href="Garuda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200">crash of a Garuda airliner</a> killed four Australian government officials and a journalist travelling in connection with a visit to Indonesia by Foreign Minister <a href="Alexander%20Downer">Alexander Downer</a>, who had flown on a Challenger. No. 34 Squadron and Qantas Defence Services marked 20,000 incident-free flying hours with the 737s and Challengers on 21 October 2008. The following year saw further controversy when Prime Minister <a href="Kevin%20Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a> had to apologise for remarks to a cabin attendant over the meal he was served on one of the jets. In 2011, the squadron provided VIP transport during tours of Australia by Queen Elizabeth, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William</a>, and <a href="Frederik%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Denmark">Frederik</a> and <a href="Mary%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Denmark">Mary of Denmark</a>, as well as support for US President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s visit to Canberra. It also flew senior government and military personnel in support of relief efforts during the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Queensland%20floods">Queensland floods</a>, and was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency. No. 34 Squadron celebrated its 70th anniversary at <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House, Canberra</a>, on 18 February 2012; the following day, a memorial to its first fatalities in March 1942 was unveiled at Fairbairn. The lease on its aircraft is due to expire in 2014, and they may be replaced with new types.

On 13 October 2017, No. 34 Squadron was transferred from No. 84 Wing to No. 86 Wing. This change was made to place the unit under the same headquarters as No. 33 Squadron, whose <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A</a> aircraft are gaining a VIP role.

No. 38 Squadron RAAF

No. 38 Squadron was a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) transport and training unit active between 1943 and 2018. It was formed on 15 September 1943 and saw service during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> transporting supplies and personnel between Australia and the combat zones in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> and <a href="Borneo%20Campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo</a>, using <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas Dakota</a> aircraft. Following the war, the <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> conducted regular courier flights between Australia and Japan in 1947 and 1948. No. 38 Squadron was deployed to Singapore from 1950 to 1952, supplying Commonwealth forces engaged in the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> and undertaking courier flights across Asia. In 1954 it became responsible for training RAAF personnel to operate Dakotas.

After being re-equipped with <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou</a> in 1964, No. 38 Squadron served as the RAAF's <a href="operational%20conversion%20unit">operational conversion unit</a> for the type and also conducted transport tasks within Australia and its territories. Throughout <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War</a>, it prepared aircrew for operational service with <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 35 Squadron</a>, and maintained a detachment in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua%20and%20New%20Guinea">Papua and New Guinea</a> to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A Caribou was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor as part of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Transitional%20Administration%20in%20East%20Timor">Australian-led peacekeeping force</a> in the newly independent nation. No. 38 Squadron continued to operate Caribou after No. 35 Squadron was disbanded in 2000, though the age of the aircraft increasingly affected its operations.

Following the retirement of the Caribou from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight <a href="Beechcraft%20Super%20King%20Air">Beechcraft King Air 350</a> aircraft. The squadron was stationed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Base Townsville</a>, Queensland, and was responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing light transport and tasks. It was also believed to have a ground surveillance capability. The squadron disbanded on 29 November 2018, its aircraft and roles being transferred to <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 32 Squadron</a>.

No. 38 Squadron was formed as a transport unit at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a> near <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 15 September 1943. Equipped with <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s, the squadron conducted its first operation on 17 December, when one of its aircraft flew from Richmond to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a>. During the period No. 38 Squadron was equipped with Hudsons, it operated only within Australia.

The squadron's activities expanded in early 1944, when its obsolescent Hudsons were replaced with more capable <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas Dakota</a> transports. It received its first Dakota on 3 March 1944, and was completely equipped with the type by the end of May. While the squadron continued to fly to locations within Australia after receiving Dakotas, it also began transporting supplies to Allied forces fighting the Japanese in western New Guinea. During return flights from New Guinea, the Dakotas typically carried wounded personnel to Australia for treatment. In October 1944, No. 38 Squadron was given the additional task of supporting the RAAF's <a href="Paratroop%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">Paratroop Training Unit</a> at Richmond. The squadron moved to <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Archerfield">RAAF Station Archerfield</a> near <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in early December 1944, but continued to maintain a detachment at Richmond. By this time No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with transporting supplies to the battle zone in New Guinea, which included making supply drops to <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> units in the field and evacuating casualties to the mainland. From 17 July 1945, the squadron maintained a detachment at <a href="Leo%20Wattimena%20Airport">Morotai Island</a>, dropping supplies to Army units <a href="Borneo%20Campaign%20%281945%29">fighting in Borneo</a>. No. 38 Squadron's only loss during World War II was a Dakota that crashed on a mountain in western New Guinea while flying between <a href="Frans%20Kaisiepo%20International%20Airport">Biak</a> and Morotai; the wreckage of this aircraft was not located until 1970.

After the war, No. 38 Squadron flew into <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and locations in Borneo to evacuate released Australian prisoners of war. The squadron also transported other service personnel back to Australia until 1946 as part of the <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20Australian%20military%20after%20World%20War%20II">demobilisation of the Australian military</a>. During May 1946, three of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were assigned the unusual task of flying 25 tonnes of pig bristles from <a href="Chongqing">Chongqing</a> in China to <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. This mission, which was designated "<a href="Operation%20Pig%20Bristle">Operation Pig Bristle</a>", took two weeks and sought to rectify a shortage of paint brushes that was hindering the Australian construction industry.

No. 38 Squadron relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a> near Sydney on 15 August 1946. It became part of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing</a>, along with <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 36</a> and <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAAF">37 Squadrons</a>, which also operated Dakotas, and <a href="No.%20486%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>, which serviced the wing's flying units. Commencing on 22 January 1947, one of No. 38 Squadron's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice-weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>. These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin-engined aircraft at the time, and took several days. The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948, after which chartered <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> aircraft were used to support the force in Japan. In August 1948, five of No. 38 Squadron's air crews were dispatched to Europe where, as members of the <a href="RAAF%20Squadron%20Berlin%20Air%20Lift">RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift</a>, they participated in the international efforts to fly supplies into <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> during the <a href="Berlin%20Blockade">Soviet blockade of the city</a>. These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months, and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron's operations. Overall, twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit, all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records. No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949.
In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was selected to form part of the Australian force assigned to the Commonwealth <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">Far East Air Force</a>. As an element of this force, the Australian Government agreed for the unit to be tasked with courier flights across Asia and providing support for the British-led <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">counterinsurgency operations</a> in Malaya. The squadron's advance party arrived at <a href="Changi%20Air%20Base">RAF Changi</a> in Singapore on 19 June 1950, and all of its personnel and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron came under the command of <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a>, along with the <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>-equipped <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>. Half the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, but none had any direct experience of tropical environments. No. 38 Squadron began flying transport missions in Malaya in early July, with British and New Zealand pilots accompanying its aircrews during the first two weeks of operations to help them become familiar with local conditions. From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's main task was to conduct courier flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an important responsibility throughout the period it was based at Singapore. Following the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were transferred to <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Communication Unit</a> in Japan during November 1950.

After losing half its strength, No. 38 Squadron remained at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya to support the British-led forces there. The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> from <a href="No.%2041%20Squadron%20RNZAF">No. 41 Squadron RNZAF</a> was stationed at <a href="RAF%20Kuala%20Lumpur">RAF Kuala Lumpur</a>, and was the main unit tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952. In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">22nd Special Air Service Regiment</a> into a remote area near the Malaya-Thailand border.

Supporting the Australian units in Korea placed heavy demands on the RAAF's transport force, which was too small to fully meet its domestic and international responsibilities, and it became increasingly difficult to sustain the four Dakotas in Malaya during 1952. As a result, the Australian Government decided in September that year to return the squadron to Australia. No. 38 Squadron left Changi for Richmond on 8 December. The squadron's only fatality during the deployment was an airman who was killed when the <a href="No.%20110%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 110 Squadron RAF</a> Dakota he was co-piloting crashed during a flight between Changi and <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a> on 31 August 1950.

After returning to Richmond, No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with routine transport duties. The squadron also occasionally provided aircraft for <a href="Commonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation">CSIRO</a> <a href="rainmaking">rainmaking</a> experiments. During the 1950s and early 1960s, No. 38 Squadron developed a reputation as a "cowboy" unit with lax flying standards. The squadron did not conduct proper conversion courses, and new Dakota pilots received only ad-hoc instruction on the type while serving as the co-pilot during operational tasks. On 8 March 1953, No. 38 Squadron absorbed No. 36 Squadron's Dakotas, after which <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Transport Unit</a> (previously No. 30 Communication Unit) in Japan was renamed No. 36 Squadron. From late March until September 1954, No. 38 Squadron conducted VIP flights out of <a href="Fairbairn%2C%20Canberra">RAAF Station Canberra</a>. In November that year, it was renamed the Transport Training Squadron and became responsible for instructing new Dakota crews and RAAF air movements personnel. It resumed its previous name on 13 June 1963.

No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with new <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou</a> tactical transport aircraft during 1964. In January 1964 the unit's commanding officer, five other pilots and three navigators undertook conversion training on the type in Canada. At the completion of this course the personnel flew the RAAF's first three Caribous from <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> to RAAF Base Richmond between 17 March and 22 April. The process of fully converting No. 38 Squadron to Caribous was delayed by the government's decision to deploy several of the aircraft to Vietnam; at the time this decision was made, in June 1964, the squadron had received six of its planned allocation of nine aircraft, and the next batch of three aircraft was sent directly to Vietnam. No. 38 Squadron was the last operational RAAF squadron to fly Dakotas, though several other units did so until the 1990s. After receiving its Caribous, No. 38 Squadron's main role was to train aircrews for operational service with the <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAAF">RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam</a> (later redesignated No. 35 Squadron). On 1 July 1964, one of the squadron's Caribous suffered severe damage when it made a crash landing at <a href="HMAS%20Albatross%20%28air%20station%29">HMAS "Albatross"</a>; this aircraft was subsequently written off and its fuselage used for training purposes by the Army's <a href="1st%20Commando%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">1st Commando Regiment</a>. The squadron became an independent unit under Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond in August that year, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing. On 13 October 1965, Detachment A of No. 38 Squadron began operations from <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in the <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua%20and%20New%20Guinea">Territory of Papua and New Guinea</a>, equipped with two Caribous. One of the detachment's tasks was to give Caribou pilots experience in tropical and mountainous conditions, and all aircraft captains were required to complete at least one two-month deployment to Port Moresby before serving with No. 35 Squadron in Vietnam. In addition to its training role, No. 38 Squadron undertook transport flights in and around Australia, taking part when required in relief efforts following natural disasters.

The squadron undertook two operational deployments during the mid-1970s. From March 1975 until November 1978 Detachment B, comprising a single Caribou and support staff, was stationed at <a href="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a>, Pakistan, and transported personnel and supplies for the <a href="United%20Nations%20Military%20Observer%20Group%20in%20India%20and%20Pakistan">United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan</a>. From August to October 1975, a No. 38 Squadron Caribou was assigned to transport <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> supplies and personnel from Darwin to <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> after a civil war broke out in that country. On 4 September that year this aircraft was hijacked by East Timorese soldiers, who forced the pilot to fly 54 refugees to Darwin; it remains the only RAAF aircraft ever to have been hijacked. Detachment A was no longer required after Papua New Guinea achieved independence from Australia and established its own defence force, and the unit was disbanded on 17 January 1976. Three Caribous were lost while operating with the detachment; A4-202 crashed near <a href="Porgera">Porgera</a> on 3 June 1965, A4-147 was written off after it landed short of the runway at <a href="Tapini%20Airport">Tapini Airport</a> on 6 October 1968 and A4-233 was destroyed when it crashed at <a href="Kudjeru%20Gap">Kudjeru Gap</a> on 28 August 1972. The last of these crashes caused the deaths of 25 aircrew and passengers, making it the RAAF's worst peacetime disaster; 21 of the people killed were high school students returning from an army cadet camp. Following the end of its permanent presence at Port Moresby, No. 38 Squadron continued to fly periodic training sorties in Papua New Guinea. During the 1980s, detachments of No. 38 Squadron were established at RAAF Base Darwin and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a> near <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> to provide these regions with a search-and-rescue capability and to exercise with Army units. The Pearce detachment was nicknamed "Blackduck Airlines".

No. 38 Squadron moved from Richmond to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At this time the squadron continued to be responsible for all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Base Townsville</a> in <a href="North%20Queensland">North Queensland</a> during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful <a href="East%20Timorese%20independence%20referendum%2C%201999">referendum on independence</a> conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the <a href="Regional%20Assistance%20Mission%20to%20Solomon%20Islands">Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands</a> peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Honiara International Airport</a>, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.
By the late 2000s the Caribous were becoming difficult to maintain, and were no longer capable of operating in war zones as they lacked <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> systems and other forms of self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with <a href="Beechcraft%20Super%20King%20Air">Beechcraft King Air 350s</a> on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. 

Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's <a href="173rd%20Surveillance%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">173rd Surveillance Squadron</a> on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft is believed to have been fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's <a href="Oakey%20Army%20Aviation%20Centre">Oakey Army Aviation Centre</a>, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered. No. 38 Squadron marked its 70th anniversary in 2013.
In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were deployed to <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> as part of Australia's aid effort following <a href="Cyclone%20Pam">Cyclone Pam</a>. The aircraft were used to conduct flights over the affected areas to assess the extent of the damage, and also evacuated Australian and New Zealand citizens. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the hazardous chemical <a href="strontium%20chromate">strontium chromate</a> was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202016">2016 federal election</a>. The King Airs began to return to service on 4 August that year after being cleaned. As part of its budget for the 2016-17 financial year, the Australian Government announced that Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare equipment would be acquired for three of No. 38 Squadron's King Airs. This equipment comprised roll-on/roll-off kits, and was scheduled to be delivered during the financial year. 

In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a>. No. 38 Squadron began to be reduced in size during that year. In February 2018 the Department of Defence announced that No. 38 Squadron would relocate to RAAF Base East Sale later that year. The September 2018 edition of "Australian Aviation" reported that No. 38 Squadron was to be disbanded in November 2018.

No. 38 Squadron was disbanded at a ceremony at RAAF Base Townsville on 29 November 2018. This marked the end of 75 years continuous service, the longest period for any RAAF squadron. Its aircraft and role, including the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare function, was transferred to No. 32 Squadron.

In its final role, No. 38 Squadron was responsible for providing conversion training on the King Air and conducting light transport operations. As of 2014, the unit had a strength of 60 RAAF personnel as well as 25 aircraft maintenance contractors from Hawker Pacific. It was organised into two flights; A Flight undertook transport operations, and B Flight was responsible for delivering training courses. As of 2018, the squadron's Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare capabilities were classified, but were reported to include a communications relay function. The aircraft had also been used as a platform for aerial photography after being transferred to the RAAF; this has included taking photographs to be used in map making. Along with <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 33</a> and 36 Squadrons, No. 38 Squadron formed part of No. 86 Wing. 

The RAAF has been satisfied with the King Air's performance in the light transport role, though the aircraft cannot be deployed into combat areas. No. 38 Squadron often operated with the Army's Townsville-based <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>, as well as the <a href="51st%20Battalion%2C%20Far%20North%20Queensland%20Regiment">51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment</a>, which conducts operational patrols across <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a> during peacetime. The unit was also frequently tasked with transporting senior politicians and other VIPs. The King Airs often operated in Papua New Guinea, as well as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Government ordered 10 <a href="Alenia%20C-27J%20Spartan">Alenia C-27J Spartan</a> battlefield transports in May 2012, and these aircraft are operated by No. 35 Squadron.

Senghenydd colliery disaster

The Senghenydd colliery disaster, also known as the Senghenydd explosion (), occurred at the <a href="Universal%20Colliery">Universal Colliery</a> in <a href="Senghenydd">Senghenydd</a>, near <a href="Caerphilly">Caerphilly</a>, Glamorgan, Wales, on 14 October 1913. The explosion, which killed 439 miners and a rescuer, is still the worst <a href="mining%20accident">mining accident</a> in the United Kingdom. Universal Colliery, located on the <a href="South%20Wales%20Coalfield">South Wales Coalfield</a>, produced <a href="steam%20coal">steam coal</a> which was much in demand. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of <a href="firedamp">firedamp</a>, a highly explosive gas consisting of <a href="methane">methane</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and were prone to explosions.

In an earlier disaster in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> established that the colliery had high levels of airborne <a href="coal%20dust">coal dust</a>, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in the east side of the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and <a href="afterdamp">afterdamp</a>—a poisonous mixture of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> left after an explosion.

Fires in the workings hampered rescue efforts, and it took several days before they were under control. It took six weeks for most of the bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pence</a>.

In 1981 a memorial to the men who died in the disaster was unveiled by the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a>, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion.

The <a href="Coal%20industry%20in%20Wales">Welsh coal industry</a> employed 1,500 workers in 1800; and as the industry expanded, the workforce rose to 30,000 by 1864, and to 250,000 by 1913. As employment became available, many people moved to the area of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Coalfield">South Wales Coalfield</a>; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8 million <a href="long%20ton">long ton</a>s of coal (63.6 million <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s) a year, up from 8.5 million long tons (9.5 million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined a fifth of all coal produced in the UK, and employed a fifth of its miners in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1913 Britain was responsible for 25 per cent of world coal production and 55 percent of all world coal exports.

The South Wales Coalfield produced the sought-after <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a>, <a href="bituminous%20coal">bituminous</a> and <a href="steam%20coal">steam coal</a>s—the latter a grade between the two comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of <a href="firedamp">firedamp</a>, a highly explosive gas consisting of <a href="methane">methane</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is <a href="afterdamp">afterdamp</a>, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. The carbon monoxide combines with <a href="haemoglobin">haemoglobin</a> in the bloodstream to form <a href="carboxyhemoglobin">carboxyhemoglobin</a>, which prevents the blood cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">anoxia</a>. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face the possibility of being killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.

Senghenydd— in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>—is situated at the northern end of the <a href="Aber%20Valley">Aber Valley</a>, approximately north-west of <a href="Caerphilly">Caerphilly</a> and north-west of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. When geological surveys for coal began in 1890 it was a farming hamlet of around 100 people. Coal was found, and sinking of the first mineshaft for <a href="Universal%20Colliery">Universal Colliery</a>—which was owned and developed by <a href="William%20Lewis%2C%201st%20Baron%20Merthyr">William Lewis</a>—began in 1891; the first coal was extracted in 1896. The colliery's two shafts were both deep, the downcast Lancaster and the upcast York. Development of the pit coincided with the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>, and sectors of the underground workings were named after key places in the war, such as <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, or the lifting of the sieges at <a href="Siege%20of%20Ladysmith">Ladysmith</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Mafeking">Mafeking</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Kimberley">Kimberley</a>.
South Wales miners, including those at Universal, were paid on a rate determined by the Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, <a href="Welsh%20coal%20strike%20of%201898">in 1898, a strike</a> that the men at Universal joined at the end of April. The <a href="Monmouthshire%20and%20South%20Wales%20Coal%20Owners%27%20Association">Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association</a> refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400 short tons) of coal a week.

The industrial historians Helen and Baron Duckham consider Universal Colliery to have been "an unlucky mine". At approximately 5:00 am on 24 May 1901 three underground explosions occurred as the night shift was exiting the pit. Because the explosion damaged the pit winding gear, it took time to clear the debris from the pithead to allow rescuers to begin work. They descended at 11:00 am and rescued one man, an <a href="wikt%3Aostler">ostler</a>, found alongside the corpse of the horse he was tending. There were no other survivors and 81 men died. Although the funerals for the victims started four days later, the rescue and recovery operations lasted for six weeks.

The Mines Inspectorate began an enquiry, chaired by the mining engineer <a href="William%20Galloway%20%28mining%20engineer%29">William Galloway</a>. The report was published on 15 July. It stated that the mine was hot with high levels of coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.
In 1906 <a href="Courri%C3%A8res%20mine%20disaster">a major explosion</a> at a colliery in <a href="Courri%C3%A8res">Courrières</a>, northern France, caused the deaths of more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the <a href="Coal%20Mines%20Act%201911">Coal Mines Act 1911</a>, which came into force December that year. Among other changes to the health and safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.

In 1913 the colliery was producing 1,800 long tons (2,000 short tons) of coal a day, and Senghenydd's population had grown to just under 6,000. No work was undertaken at Senghenydd to implement the requirement, and the Mines Inspectorate gave the management an extended deadline of September 1913 to complete the work, but this was missed.

At 3:00 am on 14 October 1913, the day firemen descended the pit to conduct the daily checks for gas; they had three hours to complete their investigations. The firemen for the Mafeking return had to travel more than two miles from the shaft bottom to the workface. It left insufficient time in which to make a thorough check of the workings—which involved placing a naked flame into cavities to see if the flame lengthened—although the historian Michael Lieven states that "the company considered any other form of inspection to be too time-consuming". Between 5:10 and 6:00 am 950 men descended the shaft for a shift that was due to last until 2:00 pm.

Just after 8:00 am an explosion occurred in the west side of the underground workings. It is possible there were two explosions as survivors stated a smaller explosion preceded the main one, although the official report referred only to one. The cause was probably a build-up of firedamp that was ignited by an electric spark from equipment such as electric bell signalling gear. The initial explosion ignited airborne coal dust, and a shock wave ahead of the explosion raised yet more coal dust, which also combusted. Many victims who were not killed immediately by the explosion and fire died from the effects of afterdamp. The explosive wave travelled up the Lancaster shaft to the surface, destroying the <a href="headframe">headframe</a>; it killed the winder—the man in charge—and badly injured his deputy.
Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, was on the surface and the remaining shift foremen were still underground and unable to give assistance. He took charge and descended the York shaft, accompanied by overman D R Thomas. The descent was slow, and they had to clear several girders and obstructions before they reached the bottom. They found that the men from the east side of the workings (approximately 450 workers) were unharmed, and their evacuation was ordered. Shaw and Thomas moved to the western side, where they found other men, alive but injured, and arranged for them to travel to the surface. Thomas later reported that the view into the western workings "was exactly like looking into a furnace".

Shaw explored what he could of the western workings, before he and some of the survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30 am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00 am the specialist <a href="mines%20rescue">mines rescue</a> teams began arriving at the colliery from the <a href="Rhymney%20Valley">Rhymney</a> and <a href="Rhondda">Rhondda</a> Valleys, as did <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning.
Lieven recounts how the rescue parties "in their desperation, ... were reckless with their lives" in their attempts to find survivors; many were injured in small roof collapses, or suffered the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their endeavours saved lives throughout the remainder of the day and into the night, including a group of 18 men found at around 1:00 am. They were the last survivors found. A total of 432 miners had died that day—although some bodies were not found until later—and 7 others died later in hospital or at home. A journalist from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote: "The numbers are truly awful. We talk in awed terms of the decimation of a regiment in a bloody battle, but here a great community engaged in the pursuit of a peaceful vocation is threatened with the loss of at least a quarter of its able bodied manhood". On the surface the townsfolk waited for news; a reporter for "<a href="The%20Courier%20%28Dundee%29">The Dundee Courier</a>" thought: "the scene at Senghenydd last night was depressing in the extreme. The streets were full of silent throngs of people who moved aimlessly about or stood stolidly at the street corners."

Work continued throughout the night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their <a href="Will%20and%20testament">wills</a>. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During the course of the day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.
<a href="Reginald%20McKenna">Reginald McKenna</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, visited the colliery on 15 October representing <a href="George%20V">King George V</a>, who was attending the marriage of <a href="Prince%20Arthur%20of%20Connaught">Prince Arthur of Connaught</a> and <a href="Princess%20Alexandra%2C%202nd%20Duchess%20of%20Fife">Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife</a>. The king sent a £500 donation to a disaster relief fund, while the royal couple displayed their wedding presents at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> and charged a <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a> for entrance, raising £1,200 for the fund. The fund was started by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, while another collection, the <a href="Mansion%20House%2C%20London">Mansion House</a> Fund set up by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, raised more than £3,000 on its first day.

<a href="William%20Brace">William Brace</a>, the local <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> speaking on behalf of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Miners%27%20Federation">South Wales Miners' Federation</a>, announced on 16 October that the priority would be given to putting out the fire and that no more search parties would be looking for survivors. Brace observed that the fire was blocking the western workings and consuming the oxygen in the air, making it unlikely that anyone was left alive. Progress in tackling the fire over the previous days had been slow, and it had only been extinguished in the first 30 yards of the roadway—still from the coal face. Two <a href="coroner">coroner</a>'s inquests were opened: one in Senghenydd for the men who died in the colliery, and one in Cardiff for those who had died in hospital; both were adjourned the same day. The first funerals took place the following day, Friday 17 October. An estimated 150,000 mourners gathered for the 11 men buried on the Saturday and 8 on the Sunday.
The firefighters built bashings, walls of sandbags, turf and sand, approximately 18 feet (5.5 metres) deep and 17 feet (5.2 metres) up to the tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling the rest of the workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300 feet (91.5 metres) long and 30 to 40 feet (10–12 metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.

By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts had been fully explored, with more than 200 bodies raised to the surface in the preceding two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still unaccounted for. Toward the end of the month, the men voted to return to work, even though the western workings were still out of action and 11 bodies were still missing.

A photographer, W Benton, took a series of photographs as the disaster unfolded, and later published them as a set of postcards. Their publication is described by the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Wales">National Library of Wales</a> as "an excellent example of early photo-journalism". The photographs came with a caption, shown below:

The Senghenydd explosion remains the worst mining disaster in Britain. The deaths of 440 men on a small community had a devastating effect; 60 victims were younger than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost their fathers and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while the death of one father and son left an 18-year-old daughter to raise her 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger.

The inquiry into the disaster opened on 2 January 1914 with <a href="Richard%20Redmayne">Richard Redmayne</a>, the Chief Inspector of Mines, as the commissioner; he was assisted by two assessors, <a href="Sir%20Evan%20Williams%2C%201st%20Baronet">Evan Williams</a>, the chairman of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coal Owners Association, and <a href="Robert%20Smillie">Robert Smillie</a>, the president of the <a href="Miners%27%20Federation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Miners' Federation of Great Britain</a>. The inquiry ran for three days before being adjourned to allow for the coroner's inquest to run at Senghenydd. It reopened on 27 January and ran until 21 February. Over the 13 days it heard evidence, 21,837 questions were put to 50 witnesses. The coroner's inquest chaired by David Rees lasted for 5 days from 5 January 1914. A total of 9,000 questions were put to 50 witnesses, and the jury returned verdicts of accidental death.

The inquiry report failed to identify a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of many aspects of the management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.

Further criticism was directed toward the emergency procedures. The lack of respirators at the mine was deemed to have cost lives. The lack of an adequate water supply for fire fighting was criticised, and Redmayne wrote: "I should have thought, in view of the fact that the colliery was such a gassy one, and it had already been devastated by an explosion, that the management would have made arrangements for a supply of water adequate to meet an emergency of the kind that actually occurred."

Shaw's actions were described by Lieven as those that "gained him a degree of respect from the local mining community which remained over the years; they probably also cost the lives of scores of miners." The Duckhams describe Shaw's inaction in fixing the ventilation fan before the explosion, as well as his delay in sending for assistance from rescue teams until he exited the mine an hour and a half after the explosion. The official report considered there had been a "disquieting laxity in the management of the mine", although Shaw was described by the Duckhams as "undoubtedly a highly capable manager". The report led to Shaw being charged with 17 breaches of the Mines Act 1911, and four charges were made against the company. Shaw was found guilty of failing to keep adequate environmental records and failing to replace a broken lamp locker; he was fined £24. The company was convicted of failing to provide a ventilation system that could reverse the airflow and was fined £10 with £5 5 shillings costs. One newspaper, "<a href="Merthyr%20Pioneer">Merthyr Pioneer</a>", calculated "Miners' Lives at 1/1 each" (1 shilling 1d or 5p each).

After it reopened the colliery never reached the same levels of employment as before the explosion. William Lewis died in August 1914; Shaw continued as manager of the mine until November 1928, when it closed.

A stage play based on the disaster, by the journalist and broadcaster Margaret Coles, was first performed at the <a href="Sherman%20Cymru">Sherman Cymru</a>, Cardiff in 1991. The disaster at Senghenydd has provided the backdrop to two printed works of historical fiction: <a href="Alexander%20Cordell">Alexander Cordell</a>'s "<a href="This%20Sweet%20and%20Bitter%20Earth">This Sweet and Bitter Earth</a>" (1977) and "Cwmwl dros y Cwm" (2013) by Gareth F Williams.

In 1981 a memorial to those lost in the disaster was unveiled by the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a>. Based outside Nant-y-parc Primary School, which is built on the site of the former colliery, the monument is a high replica of the colliery's winding gear. A second monument was unveiled in 2006 to the dead from both the 1901 and 1913 explosions.

On 14 October 2013, the centenary of the disaster, a Welsh national memorial to all mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead. Funded by the Aber Valley Heritage Group and their patron <a href="Roy%20Noble">Roy Noble</a>, with matched funding from the <a href="Welsh%20Government">Welsh Government</a>, a bronze statue by Les Johnson depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion, was unveiled by <a href="Carwyn%20Jones">Carwyn Jones</a>, the <a href="First%20Minister%20of%20Wales">First Minister of Wales</a>. Jones said: "Mining is central to the story of Wales. It has shaped our history and communities and its social and physical legacy is still with us to this day. ... It is only right that we have a permanent memorial."

CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship

The CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship ("Campeonato Mundial de Peso Semicompleto del CMLL" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>) is a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20championship%23World%20championships">world heavyweight championship</a> promoted by <a href="Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre</a> (CMLL) since 1991. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via legitimate competition; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The official definition of the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20weight%20classes%23Mexico">light heavyweight division</a> in Mexico is between and , but the weight limits are not always strictly adhered to. Because CMLL puts more emphasis on the lower weight classes, this division is considered more important than the heavyweight division, which is considered the most important championship by most <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotions</a> outside Mexico.

<a href="Niebla%20Roja">Niebla Roja</a> is the current CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after winning a tournament for the <a href="wikt%3Avacate">vacant</a> championship on June 10, 2017. He is the 16th overall champion and the 14th wrestler to officially hold the championship. The title has been vacated twice since its creation in 1991, and has had one unofficial reign.

The Mexican <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">professional wrestling promotion</a> <a href="Empresa%20Mexicana%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre</a> (EMLL; "Mexican Wrestling Enterprise") was founded in 1933 and initially recognized a series of "Mexican National" wrestling championships, endorsed by the "Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F." (Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling <a href="Commissioner%23Sports">Commission</a>). The <a href="Mexican%20National%20Light%20Heavyweight%20Championship">Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship</a> was created in 1942 as EMLL began promoting matches for that championship with the approval and oversight of the wrestling commission. In the 1950s EMLL became a member of the <a href="National%20Wrestling%20Alliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> (NWA) and began promoting the <a href="NWA%20World%20Light%20Heavyweight%20Championship">NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship</a> in the late 1950s. Previously that championship had been promoted in the US, but the NWA gave EMLL full control of the championship in 1958, positioning the NWA title as the highest-ranking title in the light heavyweight division.

EMLL left the NWA In the late 1980s, and later rebranded themselves as "Consejo Mundal de Lucha Libre" (CMLL; "World Wrestling Council"). In 1991 CMLL decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, with the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship ("Campeonato Mundial Semicompleto de CMLL" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>) created as the second CMLL-branded championship, after the <a href="CMLL%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">CMLL World Heavyweight Championship</a>. <a href="Jerry%20Estrada">Jerry Estrada</a> was chosen as the first champion, with CMLL booking the tournament for the championship to end with Estrada defeating <a href="Pierroth%20Jr.">Pierroth Jr.</a> In 1996 the then-champion <a href="Dr.%20Wagner%20Jr.">Dr. Wagner Jr.</a> lost the championship to <a href="Yoshihiro%20Tajiri">Aquarius</a> on a show in Japan, but the title change was not approved by CMLL and thus was never officially recognized. Dr. Wagner Jr. won the title back eight days later before returning to Mexico. Since the title change was not officially recognized, CMLL considers Dr. Wagner Jr. a two-time champion, not a three-time champion.

On January 15, 2013, then-reigning champion <a href="Rush%20%28wrestler%29">Rush</a> voluntarily gave up the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship as part of his ongoing <a href="feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">storyline feud</a> with then-CMLL World Heavyweight Champion <a href="El%20Terrible">El Terrible</a>. As part of the storyline, El Terrible stated that he would not defend against someone who represented a lower weight class, so Rush moved into the Heavyweight division for a title match. CMLL held a 16-man "<a href="torneo%20cibernetico">torneo cibernetico</a>" elimination match to determine which two wrestlers should compete in the finals for the vacant title. On January 29, 2013, <a href="Rey%20Escorpi%C3%B3n">Rey Escorpión</a> defeated <a href="Volador%20Jr.">Volador Jr.</a> in the tournament finals to become the 13th overall champion.

On April 8, 2016 <a href="La%20M%C3%A1scara%20%28wrestler%29">La Máscara</a> won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion by defeating <a href="%C3%81ngel%20de%20Oro">Ángel de Oro</a>. On May 22, 2017, La Máscara was fired by CMLL and the championship was <a href="wikt%3Avacate">vacated</a>. On June 10, 2017 <a href="Niebla%20Roja">Niebla Roja</a> won the championship by outlasting 9 other wrestlers, <a href="B%C3%A1rbaro%20Cavernario">Bárbaro Cavernario</a>, <a href="Blue%20Panther">Blue Panther</a>, <a href="Car%C3%ADstico">Carístico</a>, <a href="Hombre%20Bala%20Jr.">Drone</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Idol">Johnny Idol</a>, <a href="Misterioso%20Jr.">Misterioso Jr.</a>, <a href="P%C3%B3lvora">Pólvora</a>, <a href="Psicosis%20II">Reapper</a> and <a href="Stuka%20Jr.">Stuka Jr.</a>, in a 10-man "<a href="torneo%20cibernetico">torneo cibernetico</a>" elimination match.

Niebla Roja is the current CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion, having won the championship on June 10, 2017 in a show at <a href="Arena%20Coloso">Arena Coloso</a>. Overall, there have been 16 reigns shared between 14 wrestlers, which does not include one unofficial reign by Aquarius. Only two men have held the title more than once; both Dr. Wagner Jr. and <a href="Atlantis%20%28wrestler%29">Atlantis</a> have officially held the title twice. Dr. Wagner Jr. has the longest combined reigns with 1,574 days, and <a href="%C3%9Altimo%20Guerrero">Último Guerrero</a> holds the record for the longest individual reign with . Because Aquarius' eight-day reign in 1996 is not officially recognized by CMLL, Jerry Estrada's 175-day reign is the shortest in the history of the championship. Not only was Último Guerrero's reign the longest of any individual reign, he is also credited with a record 22 confirmed championship defenses.

CMLL has declared the championship vacant on two separate occasions, which meant that there was no champion for a period of time. Sometimes, a championship is vacated due to an injury to the reigning champion, or when a champion stopped working for the promotion, but in the case of the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, there was a storyline reason behind it being declared vacant the first time. In late 2013 the light heavyweight champion Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to become the next champion. The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.

The official definition by the Mexican "lucha libre" commission for the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20weight%20classes%23Mexico">light heavyweight division</a> in Mexico is between and . In the 20th century, CMLL were generally consistent and strict about enforcing the actual weight limits. In the 21st century the official definitions have at times been overlooked for certain champions. One example of this was when <a href="Mephisto%20%28wrestler%29">Mephisto</a>, officially listed as , won the <a href="CMLL%20World%20Welterweight%20Championship">CMLL World Welterweight Championship</a>, a weight class with a upper limit. Although the heavyweight championship is traditionally considered the most prestigious weight division in professional wrestling, CMLL places more emphasis on the lower weight divisions.

With <a href="Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre%23Championships">twelve CMLL-promoted championships labelled as "World" titles</a>, the promotional focus shifts from championship to championship over time with no single championship consistently promoted as the "main" championship; instead CMLL's various major shows feature different weight divisions and are most often headlined by a "<a href="Lucha%20de%20Apuestas">Lucha de Apuestas</a>" ("Bet match") instead of a championship match. From 2013 until June 2016 only two major CMLL shows have featured championship matches: "<a href="Sin%20Salida%20%282013%29">Sin Salida</a>" in 2013, and the 2014 "<a href="Juicio%20Final%20%282014%29">Juicio Final</a>" show featuring the <a href="NWA%20World%20Historic%20Welterweight%20Championship">NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship</a>. The last time a CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship match was featured on a major CMLL show was on September 18, 2004, when Último Guerrero successfully defended the title at the <a href="CMLL%2071st%20Anniversary%20Show">CMLL 71st Anniversary Show</a>. Championship matches usually take place under <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Series%20variations">best two-out-of-three falls rules</a>. On occasion single fall title matches have taken place, especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to the traditions of the local promotion. Outside CMLL, the light heavyweight championship has been defended on joint CMLL/<a href="Universal%20Wrestling%20Association">Universal Wrestling Association</a> (UWA) shows in 1993, on <a href="W%2AING">W*ING</a>, <a href="Big%20Japan%20Wrestling">Big Japan Wrestling</a>, Dragondoor and <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling">New Japan Pro Wrestling</a> shows in Japan.

CMLL held a 16-man tournament from September 15 to October 26, 1991 to crown the first light heavyweight champion. Documentation on Pierroth Jr.'s path to the finals has not been found.

CMLL held a tournament to determine the next CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion starting on January 22, 2013, and the finals were held the following week. The first round of the tournament was a 16-man "torneo cibernetico" elimination match, with the last two men in the match qualifying for the finals the following week on January 29. The "torneo" featured two teams of eight wrestling against each other; Team A consisted of <a href="Delta%20%28wrestler%29">Delta</a>, <a href="El%20Felino">El Felino</a>, La Máscara, Mephisto, <a href="Mr.%20%C3%81guila">Mr. Águila</a>, Rey Escorpión, <a href="Stuka%20Jr.">Stuka Jr.</a> and Volador Jr. and Team B consisted of Atlantis, <a href="Blue%20Panther">Blue Panther</a>, <a href="Diamante%20%28male%20wrestler%29">Diamante</a>, <a href="Euforia%20%28wrestler%29">Euforia</a>, <a href="Maximo%20%28wrestler%29">Maximo</a>, <a href="Histeria%20%28wrestler%29">Morphosis</a>, <a href="Psicosis%20II">Psicosis</a> and <a href="Sagrado%20%28wrestler%29">Sagrado</a>. The match came down to Team A's Rey Escorpión and Volado Jr. versus Team B's Euforia. Escorpión pulled off Volador Jr.'s <a href="wrestling%20mask">mask</a> and threw it to rival Euforia, causing Euforia to be disqualified, which meant that Escorpión and Volador Jr. qualified for the finals the following week. On January 29, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the finals to become the 13th overall CMLL World Light Heavyweight champion.

Boroughitis

Boroughitis (also borough fever or borough mania) was the creation in the 1890s, usually by referendum, of large numbers of small <a href="borough%20%28New%20Jersey%29">boroughs</a> in the American state of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, particularly in <a href="Bergen%20County">Bergen County</a>. Attempts by the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Legislature">New Jersey Legislature</a> to reform local government and the school systems led to the breakup of most of Bergen County's <a href="township%20%28New%20Jersey%29">townships</a> into small boroughs, communities that still <a href="Balkanization">balkanize</a> the state's political map. This occurred following the development of <a href="commuter%20suburb">commuter suburb</a>s in New Jersey, residents of which wanted more government services than did the long-time rural population.

In the late 19th century, much of New Jersey was divided into large townships. In Bergen County, several of these townships contained multiple commuter suburbs, often formed around railroad stations. Political disputes arose between the growing number of <a href="commuter">commuter</a>s, who wanted more government services for the new developments near railroad lines, and long-time residents such as farmers, who feared higher taxes. A previously little-used law permitted small segments of existing townships to vote by referendum to form independent boroughs. In late 1893, Republicans, backed by commuters, captured control of the legislature and the following year passed legislation allowing boroughs that were formed from parts of two or more townships to elect a representative to the county <a href="Board%20of%20Chosen%20Freeholders">Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>. This 1894 act, in combination with a second one the same year that consolidated school districts into one per municipality, made it easy and attractive for dissatisfied communities to break away and become boroughs, in order to gain a seat on the county board or to keep control of the local school.

Forty new boroughs were formed in 1894 and 1895, with the bulk in Bergen County, where townships were broken up or greatly reduced in size; there are few there today. Feeling that the 1894 laws had allowed the formation of an excessive number of municipalities, the legislature scuttled the right to elect a freeholder in 1895, and ended the formation of boroughs by referendum the following year. Municipalities continued to be created by the legislature into the 20th century, and although there have been efforts at consolidation in recent years to lower the cost of government, their number has been only slightly reduced.

At the time of the union of <a href="East%20Jersey">East Jersey</a> and <a href="West%20Jersey">West Jersey</a> into the <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">Province of New Jersey</a> in 1702, there were about 24 <a href="township%20%28New%20Jersey%29">townships</a>; more were added under British government by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a>, court decrees, or legislative action. Following the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Legislature">New Jersey Legislature</a> confirmed all <a href="municipal%20charter">municipal charter</a>s, and granted new ones; by 1798, the state had 104 townships. Increased economic activity in <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Essex</a>, <a href="Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morris</a> and <a href="Sussex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Sussex</a> counties, and the formation of <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Warren County</a>, raised the number to 125 by 1834.

Most of the townships had low taxes and little government; the roads (mostly of dirt) were maintained by farmers in lieu of taxes. Township meetings occurred each February; the citizens would discuss concerns, seek solutions, and collectively appoint agents to carry out their will. Voters in each township elected members of the county governing body, the <a href="Board%20of%20Chosen%20Freeholders">Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>.

The railroad brought major changes to New Jersey beginning in the mid-19th century. The state was mostly agricultural, and the new lines made it easier for farmers to get their crops to market. But they also made it easier for those employed in New York City or Philadelphia to live outside the urban core and yet go to work each day. Even before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, the <a href="Brick%20Church%20%28NJT%20station%29">Brick Church station</a>, in <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">Orange</a>, Essex County, about from New York City, became the center of the nation's first <a href="commuter%20suburb">commuter suburb</a>. New Jersey's townships acquired a new population, of <a href="commuter">commuter</a>s, who formed communities near railroad stations, and who wanted good well-lit streets and roads, quality schools, and a stake in the government. They were bitterly opposed on each issue by the rural, agricultural population (or "punkin dusters"), who feared that their taxes would be raised to pay for services they did not want.

Schools and school districts caused angry debate between commuters and long-time residents. School district lines were independent of those of townships, for every school formed its own school district. Accordingly, townships could contain a number of school districts: <a href="Bergen%20County">Bergen County</a>'s <a href="Franklin%20Township%2C%20Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Franklin Township</a> in the early 1890s contained eleven school districts serving 774 students. Bergen County was sparsely populated when the railroad lines went through in the 1850s, making for a different pattern of development than other suburban counties, such as <a href="Union%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Union</a> and <a href="Camden%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden</a>, which saw more planned development around railroad stations. Bergen's pattern of development was unique in New Jersey, with, until 1894, several commuter suburbs in a single township, something rare elsewhere in the state. 

The <a href="Town%20meeting">town-meeting</a> style of government then prescribed for townships proved ill-suited to those changing times. The <a href="New%20Jersey%20Constitution">New Jersey Constitution</a> gave the state government in <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a> relatively weak powers over the townships, but from time to time the legislature attempted reform. The townships were divided into road districts, with residents appointed to see that maintenance was done; in 1859, the state allowed residents of each district to elect a road commissioner, who saw to it their road taxes were spent effectively. Many of these districts later became individual municipalities, with the road commissioner often the first mayor.

Until 1875, municipalities had been created or modified only by special acts of the legislature, but a state constitutional amendment that year abolished special laws for individual municipalities. Thereafter, lawmakers passed general laws regarding municipalities, and left incorporation of new ones to referenda in areas wanting redress, and to the courts. In 1878, the legislature passed the Borough Act, allowing landowners in an area less than and with fewer than 1,000 people to seek a referendum on secession from the township to become a <a href="borough%20%28New%20Jersey%29">borough</a>. This referendum could take place on petition of the owners of 10 percent of the land, as measured by value, in the area in question, and 10 days notice of the vote was required. In 1882, the legislature expanded this measure to allow areas of less than to become borough commissions with some autonomy within the township. Another impetus towards more municipalities developed in the 1870s, with the New Jersey public soured on the railroads because of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. The newly <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> legislature passed laws that ended tax exemptions on railroad-owned lands. Much of the land, generally near stations, was sold off, and was transformed into communities that in the following years would <a href="Urban%20secession">secede from the township</a> in which they lay, creating some of the "doughnut holes", with boroughs surrounded by the townships they were formerly part of, that mark the New Jersey municipal landscape today.

In the 1893 elections, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> recaptured control of the New Jersey Legislature. This was due in part to another economic depression, the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, which had occurred with Democrat <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, and in part because some Democrats, like Republicans before them, had proven corrupt. The increasing commuter population also played a role; Bergen County contained (and still does) many commuter communities because of its proximity to New York City. These new residents were strongly Republican, as contrasted with the Democratic farmers. According to local historian Kevin Wright, "Having gained sufficient numbers by 1893 to challenge Punkin Dusters at the polls, the Commuters of Bergen County led a political revolution in Home Rule that finally toppled the ancien régime." Legal disputes about control of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Senate">New Jersey Senate</a> and the Republican desire to undo many Democratic policies occupied the legislature in the early part of its 1894 session. Nevertheless, interest groups such as local landowners pushed the legislature for permissive policies on municipal incorporation, hoping to gain power in the new governments.
As the legislature sat, the townships of Bergen County fractured. The provision of the Borough Act allowing separation had been little used prior to 1893. A year-long legal battle in <a href="Palisades%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Palisades Township</a>, along the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, led to a referendum that saw <a href="Tenafly%2C%20New%20Jersey">Tenafly</a> break away in January 1894. Some communities seceded in early 1894 because of disputes about how to pay for <a href="macadam">macadam</a>ized roads, which were first paved through much of Bergen County in the first half of the 1890s. The <a href="Hackensack%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hackensack</a> "Republican" reported on March 1, "the chief reason why Delford [later <a href="Oradell%2C%20New%20Jersey">Oradell</a>], <a href="Westwood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Westwood</a>, <a href="Hillsdale%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hillsdale</a> and <a href="Park%20Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Park Ridge</a> want to become boroughs is that they may avoid what is feared will be heavy macadam tax". The proposed borough of Delford would take land from multiple townships, uniting communities on both sides of the <a href="Hackensack%20River">Hackensack River</a> that shared a school, but incorporation was put on hold because of legal uncertainty as to whether a borough could be formed from parts of more than one township.

In April, the Republican majority in Trenton let it be known they were working on a bill to solve Delford's problem by allowing boroughs to be formed from portions of two or more townships, and this became the Act of May 9, 1894. The act also granted such boroughs a seat on the county Board of Chosen Freeholders. According to Wright, "the consequences of casting special legislation under guise of a general law soon became patent". Since 1885, new boroughs had not gotten their own freeholder, with borough voters instead joining with those in the township they were formerly part of to elect one. Partisans saw the political possibilities of the 1894 law, and contested control of the Bergen County government through the formation of boroughs that would elect freeholders of their party.

The energetic legislators finally reached school reform with Chapter CCCXXXV of the Public Laws of 1894. That act, passed on May 25, provided that "the several school districts in each township shall be consolidated into one school district". The legislature's intent was to equalize funding between wealthier districts and poorer ones. Had the legislature done no more, according to former <a href="New%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly">New Jersey General Assembly</a> Speaker <a href="Alan%20Karcher">Alan Karcher</a>, "New Jersey might have had fewer than 500 municipalities today". However, the legislature further enacted in the bill, "that each <a href="city%20%28New%20Jersey%29">city</a>, borough, and <a href="town%20%28New%20Jersey%29">incorporated town</a>, shall be a school district, separate and distinct from the township school district". Thus, if a community seceded from its township to form a borough, it would keep control of its school. The new township school districts would be responsible for the debts of their predecessors, meaning that some communities faced the prospect of paying off, in part, the debts of others, and seeing some of their tax dollars going to fund others' schools. Under the law, by becoming an incorporated borough, they could avoid these things.

The school legislation greatly fueled the borough craze in Bergen County. Wealthy communities that had had their own school districts now faced the prospect of sharing their school tax revenues with poorer areas, or of being divided up piecemeal in borough referenda. <a href="Allendale%2C%20New%20Jersey">Allendale</a> broke away, principally from Franklin Township, because of such fears. At 650 people, Allendale was one of the more populous boroughs formed in 1894. In such commuter communities as Park Ridge, those new residents often led the borough drives against the opposition of the old inhabitants who feared the improvements would not benefit them and that the new borough would quickly incur debt through issuance of <a href="municipal%20bonds">municipal bonds</a>.

Another new borough created by the residents to keep local school control was Woodcliff, which was formed around the settlement of Pascack from parts of <a href="Harrington%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Harrington Township</a> and <a href="Orvil%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Orvil Township</a>, and which in 1910 became <a href="Woodcliff%20Lake%2C%20New%20Jersey">Woodcliff Lake</a>. Rural <a href="Upper%20Saddle%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey">Upper Saddle River</a> broke away from Orvil Township and <a href="Mahwah%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hohokus Township</a>, taking one of Orvil Township's six schoolhouses—the press noted that the nascent borough would most likely go Democratic as only 16 Republicans could be found. <a href="Ridgewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ridgewood</a>, then a township, avoided further depredations by <a href="Midland%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Midland Park</a> and <a href="Glen%20Rock%2C%20New%20Jersey">Glen Rock</a> by incorporating as a <a href="village%20%28New%20Jersey%29">village</a>. The borough of <a href="Wood-Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Wood-Ridge</a> was formed after the boundary lines were carefully drawn with an eye to the referendum, to exclude the home of a family of prominent landowners who were opposed to the incorporation—though not excluding their farmland. Once Wood-Ridge was successfully established, the farmhouse was annexed by borough ordinance.

Of the 40 boroughs created in 1894 and 1895, 26 were in Bergen County. The ones elsewhere included <a href="Roselle%2C%20New%20Jersey">Roselle</a> and <a href="Mountainside%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mountainside</a>, in Union County. In September 1894, state Senator Henry D. Winton warned that the legislature at its next session was likely to amend if not gut the Borough Act because of the craze in Bergen County. Nine new members had been added to the Board of Chosen Freeholders from the previous sixteen, Winton noted, with a proportionate increase in the cost of government, which would be further inflated by the multiplicity of boroughs. The signal that the law might change did not slow the incorporations: Wood-Ridge, <a href="Carlstadt%2C%20New%20Jersey">Carlstadt</a>, <a href="Edgewater%2C%20New%20Jersey">Edgewater</a>, <a href="Old%20Tappan%2C%20New%20Jersey">Old Tappan</a> and other boroughs trace their geneses to late 1894. There were some fistfights and hard feelings over the borough formations, and Russell Jones, whose house was on the newly drawn line between <a href="Teaneck%2C%20New%20Jersey">Teaneck</a> and <a href="Bogota%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bogota</a>, saw it burn down as firefighters argued about who had jurisdiction.

The wave of incorporations continued into 1895, with <a href="Cliffside%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cliffside Park</a> gaining borough status in January. That month, Bergen County's school superintendent, John Terhune, wrote a report to Trenton, decrying that the law allowed borough petitioners to set the proposed lines to exclude opponents of incorporation, "The idea of allowing a bare majority the power to accept or reject a few that have dared to oppose the new fad, and for this simple expression of their rights to cut them from all school facilities is radically wrong and gross injustice. There is no defense for the injured, but they must meekly accept the situation. It is inconsistent with liberty, a term so dear to us all". Superintendent Terhune wrote that "until the boroughing is done", it would not be possible to assess the many problems that the rapid subdivision had caused: "I would not attempt to estimate, let alone approximate, the changes caused by the boroughs. It is simply inconceivable".

The Act of February 18, 1895 amended the previous year's borough bill to raise the requirement for incorporation petitions from owners of 10 percent of the land value to 50 percent. The rush was also slowed by the legislature deciding that no borough created thereafter could maintain a separate school system unless there were at least 400 children living within its limits. With the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders by then at 28 members, divided evenly between the parties, the legislature passed a bill setting the number of members of such boards in third-class counties (including Bergen) at 9, with the freeholders elected from the Delford-style boroughs to go out of office on May 8. Nevertheless, on May 9, electors in what became the borough of <a href="Englewood%20Cliffs%2C%20New%20Jersey">Englewood Cliffs</a> voted to secede from <a href="Englewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Englewood</a>, 34–1.
<a href="North%20Arlington%2C%20New%20Jersey">North Arlington</a> was incorporated as a borough by a referendum held on March 26, 1896, the day the state legislature passed a bill providing that, "no borough or village shall hereafter be incorporated in this state except by special act of the legislature." The following year, the legislature undertook a thorough revision of the laws relating to boroughs, and forbade incorporations, dissolutions, or boundary changes without its leave. This simply moved the venue for conflicts over schools from local referenda to the corridors of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20House">State House</a> in Trenton. Boroughs continued to be incorporated by legislative act, with a major burst in the 1920s. These 20th century increases in the number of boroughs were sometimes caused by conflicts over road funds, causing <a href="Caldwell%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Caldwell Township</a>, Essex County, to divide into six municipalities by 1908, and with <a href="Clementon%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Clementon Township</a>, <a href="Camden%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden County</a> fracturing into nine between 1915 and 1929.

By the 1920s, the number of municipalities in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used <a href="zoning">zoning</a> to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township as a form of government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that remains is <a href="South%20Hackensack%2C%20New%20Jersey">South Hackensack</a>, the remnants of <a href="Lodi%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lodi Township</a> that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.

A number of boroughs became townships in the early 1980s, though they did not necessarily change their form of government, as until 1986, more federal aid was available to municipalities called townships than to those styled boroughs. As of 2014, New Jersey has 565 municipalities, more than eight other states combined, and the highest number of municipalities "per capita" of any state. Its boroughs include <a href="Teterboro%2C%20New%20Jersey">Teterboro</a> in Bergen County, site of <a href="Teterboro%20Airport">an airport</a>, industrial buildings, and the homes of fewer than a hundred residents, and <a href="Pine%20Valley%2C%20New%20Jersey">Pine Valley</a> and <a href="Tavistock%2C%20New%20Jersey">Tavistock</a> in Camden County, each consisting primarily of a country club. Governor <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a> urged consolidation to lower the cost of government, and a number of municipalities have studied it, but the only significant recent merger has been that of <a href="Borough%20of%20Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton Borough</a> with <a href="Princeton%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton Township</a> (2012). 

Karcher, both while Speaker and afterwards, promoted consolidation, but saw it fall victim to home rule advocates. He discussed the long-term effect of the boroughitis craze:

The Third of May 1808

The Third of May 1808 (also known as ' or ', or ) is a painting completed in 1814 by the Spanish painter <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>, now in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, Madrid. In the work, Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s armies during the occupation of 1808 in the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>. Along with its companion piece of the same size, "<a href="The%20Second%20of%20May%201808">The Second of May 1808</a>" (or "The Charge of the <a href="Mamluk%23Under%20Napoleon">Mamelukes</a>"), it was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain at Goya's suggestion.

The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, "The Third of May 1808" marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era. According to the art historian <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a>, "The Third of May 1808" is "the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention".

"The Third of May 1808" has inspired a number of other major paintings, including a series by <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a>, and <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s "<a href="Massacre%20in%20Korea">Massacre in Korea</a>" and "<a href="Guernica%20%28painting%29">Guernica</a>".

<a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I of France</a> declared himself <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> of the <a href="French%20Republic">French Republic</a> on November 10, 1799, and crowned himself Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, the country was politically and strategically important to French interests. The reigning Spanish sovereign, <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV</a>, was internationally regarded as ineffectual. Even in his own court he was seen as a "half-wit king who renounces cares of state for the satisfaction of hunting", and a cuckold unable to control his energetic wife, <a href="Maria%20Luisa%20of%20Parma">Maria Luisa of Parma</a>. Napoleon took advantage of the weak king by suggesting the two nations conquer and divide Portugal, with France and Spain each taking a third of the spoils, and the final third going to the Spanish Prime Minister <a href="Manuel%20de%20Godoy">Manuel de Godoy</a>, along with the title "Prince of the <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a>". Godoy was seduced, and accepted the French offer. He failed, however, to grasp Napoleon's true intentions, and was unaware that his new ally and co-sovereign, the former king's son <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII of Spain</a>, was using the invasion merely as a ploy to seize the Spanish parliament and throne. Ferdinand intended not only that Godoy be killed during the impending power struggle, but also that the lives of his own parents be sacrificed.

Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when Napoleon's intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces found little resistance apart from isolated actions in disconnected areas, including <a href="Zaragoza">Saragossa</a>. Napoleon's principal commander, Marshal <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers more progressive and competent than the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a>, and Napoleon's brother <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a> was to be made king. After Napoleon convinced Ferdinand to return Spanish rule to Charles IV, the latter was left with no choice but to abdicate, on March 19, 1808, in favor of Joseph Bonaparte. 

Although the Spanish people had accepted foreign monarchs in the past, they deeply resented the new French ruler. On May 2, 1808, provoked by news of the planned removal to France of the last members of the Spanish royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the <a href="Dos%20de%20Mayo%20Uprising">Dos de Mayo Uprising</a>. A proclamation issued that day to his troops by Marshal Murat read: "The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot." Goya commemorated the uprising in his "The Second of May", which depicts a cavalry charge against the rebels in the <a href="Puerta%20del%20Sol">Puerta del Sol</a> square in the center of Madrid, the site of several hours of fierce combat. Much the better known of the pair, "The Third of May" illustrates the French reprisals: before dawn the next day hundreds of Spaniards were rounded up and shot, at a number of locations around Madrid. Civilian Spanish opposition persisted as a feature of the ensuing five-year <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>, the first to be called "<a href="guerrilla%20war">guerrilla war</a>". Irregular Spanish forces considerably aided the Spanish, Portuguese, and British armies jointly led by <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Sir Arthur Wellesley</a>, who first landed in Portugal in August 1808. By the time of the painting's conception, the public imagination had made the rioters symbols of heroism and patriotism.
Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was personally placed in a difficult position by the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and hoped for a similar development in Spain. Several of his friends, like the poets <a href="Juan%20Mel%C3%A9ndez%20Vald%C3%A9s">Juan Meléndez Valdés</a> and <a href="Leandro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Morat%C3%ADn">Leandro Fernández de Moratín</a>, were overt , the term for the supporters—collaborators in the view of many—of Joseph Bonaparte. Goya's 1798 portrait of the French ambassador-turned-commandant Ferdinand Guillemardet betrays a personal admiration. Although he maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary, Goya had by nature an instinctive dislike of authority. He witnessed the subjugation of his countrymen by the French troops. During these years he painted little, although the experiences of the occupation provided inspiration for drawings that would form the basis for his prints "The Disasters of War" ().

In February 1814, after the final expulsion of the French, Goya approached the provisional government with a request to "perpetuate by means of his brush the most notable and heroic actions of our glorious insurrection against the Tyrant of Europe". His proposal accepted, Goya began work on "The Third of May". It is not known whether he had personally witnessed either the rebellion or the reprisals, despite many later attempts to place him at the events of either day.

"The Third of May 1808" is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprising and centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised <a href="Execution%20by%20firing%20squad">firing squad</a>, the other a disorganized group of captives held at gunpoint. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, "by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target." A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer. To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot. The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.

On the right side stands the firing squad, engulfed in shadow and painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their <a href="bayonets">bayonets</a> and their <a href="shako">shako</a> headgear form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance, probably including the barracks used by the French. In the background between the hillside and the shakos is a crowd with torches: perhaps onlookers, perhaps more soldiers or victims.

The "Second" and "Third of May 1808" are thought to have been intended as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the <a href="Real%20Academia%20de%20Bellas%20Artes%20de%20San%20Fernando">Royal Academy</a> in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.

Goya's series of <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a> <a href="etching">etching</a>s "<a href="The%20Disasters%20of%20War">The Disasters of War</a>" () was not completed until 1820, although most of the prints were made in the period 1810–1814. The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as "I saw this", which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. ("One cannot look at this") is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.

At first the painting met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict war in the high style of <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.

"The Third of May" references a number of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice gives way to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary <a href="Romanticism">Romantic painters</a>—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20G%C3%A9ricault">Théodore Géricault</a>'s "<a href="Raft%20of%20the%20Medusa">Raft of the Medusa</a>" (1818–1819) and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>'s 1830 painting "<a href="Liberty%20Leading%20the%20People">Liberty Leading the People</a>".
The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of <a href="martyrdom">martyrdom</a> in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>, and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution. However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by <a href="Jusepe%20de%20Ribera">Jusepe de Ribera</a>, feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the "crown of martyrdom" for the victim.

In "The Third of May" the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a <a href="crucifixion">crucified</a> Christ, and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ's nocturnal "<a href="Agony%20in%20the%20Garden">Agony in the Garden</a>" of Gethsemane. Goya's figure displays <a href="stigmata">stigmata</a>-like marks on his right hand, while the lantern at the center of the canvas references a traditional <a href="emblem">attribute</a> of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden. Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion, he wears yellow and white: the heraldic colors of the <a href="Pope">papacy</a>. 
The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> artists, and perfected by <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in "The Third of May" the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a <a href="Conduit%20%28spiritualism%29">conduit</a> for the spiritual has been subverted.

The victim, as presented by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God in the manner of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.

The way the painting shows the progress of time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. "The Third of May" offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome is seen in the corpse of a man, splayed on the ground in the lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.

Finally, there is no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's brutality through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.

Despite the work's commemorative value, no details about its first exhibition are known, and it is not mentioned in any surviving contemporaneous accounts. This lack of commentary may be due to Fernando VII's preference for neoclassical art, and to the fact that popular revolts of any kind were not regarded as suitable subject matter by the restored <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a>. A monument to the fallen in the uprising, also commissioned in 1814 by the provisional government, "was stopped by Ferdinand VII, in whose eyes the senators and heroes of the war of independence found small favour, on account of their reforming tendencies".

According to some accounts the painting lay in storage for thirty to forty years before being shown to the public. Its mention in an 1834 Prado inventory shows that the painting remained in the possession of the government or monarchy; much of the royal collection had been transferred to the museum upon its opening in 1819. <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a> mentioned seeing "a massacre" by Goya during a visit to the museum in 1845, and a visitor in 1858 noted it as well, though both accounts refer to the work as depicting the events of the second of May, perhaps because continues to be the Spanish name for the whole episode.

In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte considered the painting important enough to warrant its own special exhibition, but it was not until 1872 that "The Third of May" was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title "Scene of the Third of May 1808". Both the "Third" and "Second of May" suffered damage in a road accident while being transported by truck to <a href="Valencia%2C%20Spain">Valencia</a> for safety during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, apparently the only time they have left Madrid. Significant paint losses to the left side of the "Second of May" have been deliberately left unrepaired. <a href="Art%20conservation%20and%20restoration">Restoration work</a> to both paintings was done in 2008 in time for an exhibition marking the bicentennial of the uprising.

In 2009, the Prado selected "The Third of May 1808" as one of the museum's fourteen most important paintings, to be displayed in <a href="Google%20Earth">Google Earth</a> at a resolution of 14,000 megapixels.

The most likely sources for "The Third of May" were popular imagery, prints, and broadsides. Depictions of firing squads were common in Spanish political imagery during the Napoleonic War, and Goya's appropriations suggest that he envisaged paintings of heroic scale that would appeal to the general public. Miguel Gamborino's 1813 devotional print "The Assassination of Five Monks from Valencia" is thought to have served as a source for Goya's composition. Points of similarity include a victim in a posture of crucifixion, whose white garment sets him apart from his companions; a <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>d monk with clenched hands who kneels to his left; and an executed corpse lying in the foreground. 

The geometry of the composition may be an ironic comment on the French painter <a href="Jacques-Louis%20David">Jacques-Louis David</a>'s 1784 work "<a href="Oath%20of%20the%20Horatii">Oath of the Horatii</a>". The outstretched arms of David's three Roman <a href="Horatii">Horatii</a> in <a href="Roman%20salute">salute</a> are transmuted into the rifles of the firing squad; the upraised arms of the Horatii's father become the victim's gesture as he faces his executioners. While David painted his figures' expressions with a neoclassical luster, Goya's reply is fashioned from brutal realism. Goya may also have been responding to a painting by <a href="Antoine-Jean%20Gros">Antoine-Jean Gros</a>; the French occupation of Madrid is the subject of Gros's "".

The first paraphrasing of "The Third of May" was <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a>'s "<a href="Execution%20of%20Emperor%20Maximilian">Execution of Emperor Maximilian</a>", painted in several versions between 1867 and 1869. In recording a current event to which neither he nor the emerging art of photography was witness, Manet seems inspired by Goya's precedent. He may have seen the work at the Prado in 1865 before beginning his own paintings, which were too sensitive to be exhibited in France in Manet's lifetime. He undoubtedly did see a print of it which was published in 1867 by an acquaintance. Art critic <a href="Arthur%20Danto">Arthur Danto</a> compares Goya's work and Manet's:

"The Third of May" also depicts an execution, an early event in the so-called Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The "Third of May" execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred on the part of Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.

"The Third of May" is cited as an influence on <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s 1937 "<a href="Guernica%20%28painting%29">Guernica</a>", which shows the aftermath of the Nazi German <a href="bombing%20of%20Guernica">bombing of Guernica</a> during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the <a href="Museo%20Nacional%20Centro%20de%20Arte%20Reina%20Sof%C3%ADa">Reina Sofía</a> showed "The Third of May", "Guernica", and the "Execution of the Emperor Maximilian" in the same room. Also in the room was Picasso's "<a href="Massacre%20in%20Korea">Massacre in Korea</a>", painted in 1951 during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>—an even more direct reference to the composition of "The Third of May". The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> or their United Nations allies.
<a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> wrote in 1957 that Goya lacked Rubens' ability to fill the canvas with an ordered composition; but he considered "The Third of May" a success because Goya "is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able to express what he wants to say with maximum force and clarity".

Kenneth Clark remarked on the painting's radical departure from <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>, and its singular intensity:

With Goya we do not think of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May is a kind of superior journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.

The 1961 film "<a href="The%20Happy%20Thieves">The Happy Thieves</a>" features a plan to steal "<a href="The%20Second%20of%20May%201808">The Second of May 1808</a>" from Prado hidden under a copy of "The Third of May 1808".

Just Like Heaven (song)

"Just Like Heaven" is a song by British <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="the%20Cure">the Cure</a>. The group wrote most of the song during recording sessions in southern France in 1987. The lyrics were written by their frontman <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a>, who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife. Before Smith had completed the lyrics, an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show "Les Enfants du Rock".

"Just Like Heaven" was the third single released from their 1987 album "<a href="Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me">Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</a>", while Smith's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song's accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a>. The song became the Cure's first American hit and reached number 40 on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" charts in 1988. It has been praised by critics and covered by artists such as <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href="Katie%20Melua">Katie Melua</a>. Smith has said he considers "Just Like Heaven" to be one of the band's strongest songs.

In order to develop material for "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me", Smith forced himself to write music for 15 days of each month. During this regimen, he developed the chords and melody which form the basis of "Just Like Heaven". Structurally, Smith found what he had written was similar to <a href="the%20Only%20Ones">the Only Ones</a>'s 1979 hit "<a href="Another%20Girl%2C%20Another%20Planet">Another Girl, Another Planet</a>". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in <a href="Southern%20France">Southern France</a>, Cure drummer <a href="Boris%20Williams">Boris Williams</a> increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence.

When the French TV show "Les Enfants du Rock" asked The Cure to provide a theme song, Smith offered the instrumental version. As he explained, "It meant the music would be familiar to millions of Europeans even before it was released". He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to <a href="Studio%20Miraval">Studio Miraval</a>, located in <a href="Le%20Val%2C%20Var">Le Val</a>, <a href="Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur">Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur</a>. The band completed the song quickly, and at the time Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two-week stay at Miraval.

"Just Like Heaven" is written in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="A%20major">A major</a> and consists of an A–E–Bm–D <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> which repeats throughout the song, except during the chorus when the band plays an Fm–G–D progression. The song's central hook is formed from a descending guitar <a href="riff">riff</a> which appears between song verses and in parts of the bridge and the last verse. This guitar line contrasts with the "fuzzier mix" of the rhythm guitars.

According to Smith, "The song is about hyperventilating—kissing and fainting to the floor." The lyrics were inspired by a trip with his then-girlfriend (and later wife) Mary Poole to <a href="Beachy%20Head">Beachy Head</a> in southern England. Smith said the opening line of the song ("Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick") refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks, but added "on another [level], it's about a seduction trick, from much later in my life".

"Just Like Heaven" was the third single released from the band's "Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me" album. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"s review of the single was undecided; writer David Stubbs described it as "a colourful, fluttery, fussy thing" and "unimpeachable", but added, "[it] turns my face green, as if having consumed too many truffles." The song was the Cure's eleventh <a href="top%2040">top 40</a> hit in the UK, and stayed on the charts there for five weeks during October and November 1987, peaking at number 29. In the United States, "Just Like Heaven" became the Cure's first top 40 hit when in January 1988 it reached number 40 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> for one week.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> said "the stately 'Just Like Heaven' [...] is remarkable and helps make the album ["Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me"] one of the group's very best". Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, wrote that the song was "instantly memorable, [and] sparkling with rough energy [...] it's a perfect showcase for Robert Smith's ear for wistful, romantic numbers. His main guitar line, a descending, gently chiming melody, contrasts perfectly against the fuzzier mix of the rhythm guitars, while Simon Gallup's bass and Boris Williams' strong, immediate drums make for a great introduction to the track." Barry Walsh of "Slant" magazine said the Cure "...is at the top of its game [...] on the simply stellar 'Just Like Heaven'. Glistening descending guitar lines, Gallup's throbbing bass line, and Williams' authoritative thumping frame a typically lovelorn Smith lyric, with the end result being one of the Cure's finest singles, and perhaps one of the best pop singles of the late '80s."

Although the later singles "<a href="Lovesong%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Lovesong</a>" and "<a href="Friday%20I%27m%20in%20Love">Friday I'm in Love</a>" reached higher chart positions, "Just Like Heaven" was the band's American breakthrough, and has been described as "in American terms, at least, the one Cure song everyone seems to know." The song inspired the name of, and was used in the 2005 film "<a href="Just%20Like%20Heaven%20%28film%29">Just Like Heaven</a>". In 2004 "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked it number 483 on their list of the "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>". In 2005 "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" ranked "Just Like Heaven" 25th on its list of "The 50 Greatest Love Songs", saying, "Turns out guys who wear black <a href="eyeliner">eyeliner</a> can be happy." The following year the song placed at number 22 on <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s poll "100 Greatest Songs of the 80s".

Robert Smith said he considers "Just Like Heaven" to be one of the band's strongest works, and called it "the best pop song the Cure have ever done". Several high-profile fans have expressed their appreciation of the song. Musician <a href="Ben%20Folds">Ben Folds</a> told "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" "everything about it—the songwriting, the music—is state of the art. It’s as good as it gets. Anytime I hear it on the radio or a mix tape, I jump around like a freak." <a href="J%20Mascis">J Mascis</a> said his band <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a>'s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989. On 16 July 2006, "Just Like Heaven" was played as a wake-up call for the crew of <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery">Space Shuttle Discovery</a> on their flight <a href="STS-121">STS-121</a> at the request of <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> <a href="Piers%20Sellers">Piers Sellers</a>' family; Sellers told <a href="mission%20control%20center">mission control center</a> that the song reminded him of "the wild, happy, beer-drinking years of my youth."
Just like Heaven was used extensively as the playout track on episode ten of the current series of the BBC TV drama New Tricks "The Queen's Speech" which was broadcast on Monday 20 October 2014.

The music video for "Just Like Heaven" was directed by <a href="Tim%20Pope">Tim Pope</a>, who had directed all of the band's previous videos since 1982's "<a href="Let%27s%20Go%20to%20Bed%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Let's Go to Bed</a>". The video was filmed in England's <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> in October 1987. Set on a cliff overlooking a sea, the video recreates many of the memories detailed in the song's lyrics. When a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> asked Smith what the song was about, he said it was inspired by "something that happened to me a long time ago—see the video!" While Smith had claimed for years that the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song, he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio, utilising footage of the water and cliffs of <a href="Beachy%20Head">Beachy Head</a> taken for the band's 1985 video for "<a href="Close%20to%20Me%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">Close to Me</a>".

During the song's piano solo the sky turns to nighttime and the band is shown clad in white shirts. Mary Poole appears in this sequence as a woman dressed in white dancing with Smith. As Smith explained, "Mary dances with me in the video because she was the girl [in the song], so it had to be her." Pope later commented, "[Poole] can honestly lay claim to being the only featured female in any Cure video, ever."

A number of <a href="cover%20versions">cover versions</a> of "Just Like Heaven" have been released, including recordings in Spanish, French, and German.

<a href="Katie%20Melua">Katie Melua</a> recorded a cover for the 2005 film "<a href="Just%20Like%20Heaven%20%28film%29">Just Like Heaven</a>", which also appeared on her 2005 album "<a href="Piece%20by%20Piece%20%28Katie%20Melua%20album%29">Piece by Piece</a>". In the UK the cover was released as a double A-side single with "<a href="I%20Cried%20for%20You/Just%20Like%20Heaven">I Cried for You</a>" in late 2005, and in the U.S. it became a minor <a href="adult%20contemporary%20radio">adult contemporary radio</a> hit in 2006.

<a href="AFI%20%28band%29">AFI</a> has covered "Just Like Heaven" as well on <a href="MTV%20Icon">MTV Icon</a> on "The Cure" in 2004 and have since incorporated it into their tour rotation for their 2013 album "<a href="Burials%20%28AFI%20album%29">Burials</a>".

An acoustic instrumental version of the song performed by Gabriel Flores y su Mariachi Internacional played over the end credits of the 2018 film <a href="Gringo%20%282018%20film%29">Gringo</a>, starring <a href="Joel%20Edgerton">Joel Edgerton</a>, <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a>, <a href="Amanda%20Seyfried">Amanda Seyfried</a>, and <a href="David%20Oyelowo">David Oyelowo</a>.

Robert Smith's personal favourite is the cover recorded by American alternative rock band <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a>, which was released as a single in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US). Dinosaur Jr.'s version has a faster <a href="tempo">tempo</a> and showcases the band's loud and distortion-heavy sound. The band's frontman <a href="J%20Mascis">J Mascis</a> explained, "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we liked it so much we didn't want to give it to them." Smith said, "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has "influenced how we play it live".

Adolfo Farsari

Adolfo Farsari (; 11 February 1841 – 7 February 1898) was an Italian <a href="Photography">photographer</a> based in <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. His <a href="photographic%20studio">studio</a>, the last notable foreign-owned studio in Japan, was one of the country's largest and most prolific commercial photographic firms. Largely due to Farsari's exacting technical standards and his entrepreneurial abilities it had a significant influence on the development of photography in Japan.

Following a brief military career, including service in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, he became a successful <a href="entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a> and commercial photographer. His photographic work was highly regarded, particularly his <a href="Hand-colouring">hand-coloured</a> portraits and landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country.

Farsari's images were widely distributed, presented or mentioned in books and periodicals, and sometimes recreated by artists in other media; they shaped foreign perceptions of the people and places of Japan and to some degree affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country.

Adolfo Farsari was born in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy-Venetia">Lombardy-Venetia</a> (then part of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, now in Italy). He began a career in the Italian military in 1859 but emigrated to the United States in 1863 and, a fervent <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>, Farsari served with the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> as a New York State Volunteer Cavalry trooper until the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. He married an American, but the marriage failed and in 1873 he left his wife and two children and moved to Japan.

Based in Yokohama, Farsari formed a partnership with <a href="E.%20A.%20Sargent">E. A. Sargent</a>. Their firm, "Sargent, Farsari & Co.", dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of at least some of the maps, notably of <a href="Miyanoshita%20Onsen">Miyanoshita</a> (in the <a href="Hakone%2C%20Kanagawa">Hakone</a> resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now "A. Farsari & Co.", published successive editions of "<a href="Keeling%27s%20Guide%20to%20Japan">Keeling's Guide to Japan</a>" and Farsari himself wrote and published "Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers". The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.

Farsari expanded his business interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883. In 1885 he formed a partnership with photographer <a href="Tamamura%20Kozabur%C5%8D">Tamamura Kozaburō</a> to acquire the "<a href="Stillfried%20%26amp%3B%20Andersen">Stillfried & Andersen</a>" studio (also known as the "Japan Photographic Association"), which had some 15 Japanese employees. The studio's stock included images by <a href="Felice%20Beato">Felice Beato</a> that it had acquired along with Beato's studio in 1877. It is not clear how long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted, for within a few years they were in competition with each other. Farsari further expanded his business in 1885 when the "Yokohama Photographic Company" (owned by David Welsh) folded and Farsari acquired its premises (next door to his own) and moved in. In addition to his Yokohama studio, Farsari likely had agents in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> and <a href="Nagasaki%2C%20Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. By the end of 1886, Farsari and Chinese photographer <a href="Tong%20Cheong">Tong Cheong</a> were the only foreign commercial photographers still operating in Japan, and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone.

In February 1886 a fire destroyed all of Farsari's <a href="Negative%20%28photography%29">negatives</a>, and he then toured Japan for five months taking new photographs to replace them. He reopened his studio in 1887. Despite his losses in the fire, by 1889 Farsari's stock comprised about 1,000 Japanese landscapes and <a href="Genre%20works">genre</a> portraits.

Following the innovations of <a href="Felice%20Beato">Felice Beato</a> and <a href="Baron%20Raimund%20von%20Stillfried">Baron Raimund von Stillfried</a>, Farsari further developed the trade in <a href="photograph%20album">photograph album</a>s. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome <a href="albumen%20print">albumen print</a>s that were <a href="Hand-colouring">hand-coloured</a> and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.

Farsari sold many of these photograph albums, particularly to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work at a pace of two or three hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe photograph album to the <a href="King%20of%20Italy">King of Italy</a>. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation earned it exclusive rights to photograph the <a href="Imperial%20Gardens%20%28Tokyo%29">Imperial Gardens</a> in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>.

Prospective colourists at "A. Farsari & Co." were interviewed by Farsari himself, who ensured they were familiar with <a href="Japanese%20painting">Japanese painting</a> techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained in a letter to his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 "A. Farsari & Co." had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.

In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese woman whom he may not have married. He described himself as living like a misanthrope, associating with very few people outside of business, and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even hoped to be made a "<a href="Knight">cavaliere</a>" and thereby join the Italian <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>.

Following Farsari's departure from Japan in 1890, his studio continued to operate and even listed him as proprietor until 1901, when <a href="Tonokura%20Tsunetar%C5%8D">Tonokura Tsunetarō</a> became the owner. Tonokura, whom Farsari had known since the mid-1870s, had long managed the day-to-day operations of the studio. In 1904 Tonokura left the business to start his own studio and another of Farsari's former employees, <a href="Watanabe%20Tokutar%C5%8D">Watanabe Tokutarō</a>, became the new owner, only to be succeeded by the former secretary, <a href="Fukagawa%20Itomaro">Fukagawa Itomaro</a>. The business was finally registered as a Japanese company in 1906 and it continued to operate until at least 1917 and possibly as late as 1923, the year in which Yokohama was largely destroyed by the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a>. "A. Farsari & Co." was the last notable foreign-owned photographic studio to operate in Japan.

Farsari expressed his view of photography in a letter to his sister, writing, "taking pictures is just a mechanical thing." In describing his development as a photographer, he wrote, "I have had no real teachers, I have learned everything from books. I bought all the necessary equipment and with no help from anyone, I printed, took photographs and so on. Then I taught others."

Farsari did not work in isolation. The works (particularly those that were hand-coloured) and practices of the many foreign and Japanese commercial photographers who operated in Yokohama from the 1860s to the 1880s have been termed "Yokohama shashin" (literally, "Yokohama photographs" or "photography"). Farsari and its other practitioners – notably Beato, Stillfried, Tamamura, <a href="Kusakabe%20Kimbei">Kusakabe Kimbei</a>, <a href="Ogawa%20Kazumasa">Ogawa Kazumasa</a>, and <a href="Uchida%20Kuichi">Uchida Kuichi</a> – produced works that in their subject matter, composition and colouring present a striking combination of the conventions and techniques of Western photography with those of Japanese artistic traditions, particularly "<a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a>". These photographers also provided the key images by which <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji-era</a> Japan and the Japanese were known to people in other countries. Their images also changed the ways in which Japanese saw their own country. Through their images, foreign photographers publicised sites that interested them, sometimes drawing Japanese attention to hitherto neglected locations. One was the now-important "Daibutsu" (great Buddha) at <a href="K%C5%8Dtoku-in">Kōtoku-in</a>, <a href="Kamakura%2C%20Kanagawa">Kamakura</a>. In a similar vein, Farsari's and others' photographs of the mausoleums of <a href="T%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D-g%C5%AB">Tōshō-gū</a> made the once restricted site familiar to a wider audience.
Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the "manners and customs" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a "<a href="Ryo%20%28currency%29">ryō</a>" "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting "manners and customs".

In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account "Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese." As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, <a href="Charles%20Wirgman">Charles Wirgman</a>'s numerous engravings for the "<a href="Illustrated%20London%20News">Illustrated London News</a>" were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: <a href="Louis-Jules%20Dumoulin">Louis-Jules Dumoulin's</a> 1888 oil painting "Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama" [sic] (now called "Carp Banners in Kyoto") draws heavily from Farsari's photograph "Gionmachi, Kioto" (now often called "View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto"); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

During the era of the <a href="collodion%20process">collodion process</a>, before the arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the <a href="Gelatin-silver%20process">gelatin silver process</a>, <a href="photographic%20film">photographic film</a>, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.

Attribution is often difficult with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This may be due to the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, "Stillfried & Andersen" or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an "Officer's Daughter", variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even <a href="Suzuki%20Shin%27ichi%20I">Suzuki Shin'ichi</a>.

The lifetime of "A. Farsari & Co." spanned the transition of Japanese photography from the early involvement and influence of foreign photographers to the emergence of an independent, native Japanese photographic identity. Coming after the first generation of photographers, the firm made significant contributions to the development of commercial photography in Japan by emphasising the excellence of materials, refining the practice of presenting photographs in albums (which became art objects in themselves), and making effective use of Farsari's own tourist-oriented publications to promote his photographic studio's work – an early, minor example of <a href="vertical%20integration">vertical integration</a>.

In its time, the work of "A. Farsari & Co." was highly regarded and popular. Besides Kipling's endorsement, photographer and prolific photography writer <a href="W.%20K.%20Burton">W. K. Burton</a> published an appraisal in an 1887 article: "I have seen no better work in the way of coloured photographs anywhere than some of Farsari's productions". In the same year, an admiring review of Farsari's work appeared in the journal "Photographic Times and American Photographer", describing it as "technically almost perfect" and showing "artistic proportion" in the selection of subjects, depicting Japanese life and providing images of the natural beauty of a country that was admittedly unfamiliar to Americans.

Later opinions have been divided. In a 1988 article, art and photography historian Ellen Handy described "A. Farsari & Co." as having become "well-known for issuing albums of landscape views in great quantity, but without regard for print quality and delicacy of hand-colouring". Terry Bennett, a specialist in the early photography of Asia, refers to Farsari's work as "inconsistent and lacking the quality found in the photography of Beato, Stillfried or Kusakabe." But Bennett also notes that Farsari employed excellent artists, used the best paper and produced some "stunningly coloured photographs". For historian Sebastian Dobson, the artistic and historical significance of the work of Farsari (and other Yokohama photographers of his era, particularly Kusakabe and Tamamura) is rightly undergoing re-evaluation after many years in which it was dismissed as tourist <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> and "perceived by some as pandering to nineteenth-century Western notions of exoticism". Farsari's photographs and albums are included in numerous museums and private collections around the world, and a selection of his works was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2004.

Carl Hans Lody

Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Inglis (20 January 1877 – 6 November 1914; name occasionally given as Karl Hans Lody), was a reserve officer of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> who spied in the United Kingdom in the first few months of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

He grew up in <a href="Nordhausen">Nordhausen</a> in central Germany and was orphaned at an early age. After embarking on a nautical career at the age of 16, he served briefly in the Imperial German Navy at the start of the 20th century. His ill health forced him to abandon a naval career, but he remained in the naval reserve. He joined the <a href="Hamburg%20America%20Line">Hamburg America Line</a> to work as a tour guide. While escorting a party of tourists, he met and married a German-American woman, but the marriage broke down after only a few months. His wife divorced him and he returned to Berlin.

In May 1914, two months before war broke out, Lody was approached by German naval intelligence officials. He agreed to their proposal to employ him as a peacetime spy in southern France, but the outbreak of the First World War on 28 July 1914 resulted in a change of plans. In late August, he was sent to the United Kingdom with orders to spy on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. He posed as an American — he could speak English fluently, with an American accent — using a genuine U.S. passport purloined from an American citizen in Germany. Over the course of a month, Lody travelled around Edinburgh and the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> observing naval movements and coastal defences. By the end of September 1914, he was becoming increasingly worried for his safety as a rising spy panic in Britain led to foreigners coming under suspicion. He travelled to Ireland, where he intended to keep a low profile until he could make his escape from the UK.

Lody had been given no training in espionage before embarking on his mission and within only a few days of arriving he was detected by the British authorities. His un-coded communications were detected by British censors when he sent his first reports to an address in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> that the British knew was a postbox for German agents. The British counter-espionage agency <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, then known as , allowed him to continue his activities in the hope of finding out more information about the German spy network. His first two messages were allowed to reach the Germans but later messages were stopped, as they contained sensitive military information. At the start of October 1914, concern over the increasingly sensitive nature of his messages prompted to order Lody's arrest. He had left a trail of clues that enabled the police to track him to a hotel in <a href="Killarney">Killarney</a>, Ireland, in less than a day.

Lody was put on public trial — the only one held for a German spy captured in the UK in either World War — before a military court in London at the end of October. He did not attempt to deny that he was a German spy. His bearing in court was widely praised as forthright and courageous by the British press and even by the police and officers who had tracked him down. He was convicted and sentenced to death after a three-day hearing. Four days later, on 6 November 1914, Lody was shot at dawn by a firing squad at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> in the first execution there in 167 years. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in East London. When the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> came to power in Germany in 1933, it declared him a national hero. Lody became the subject of memorials, eulogies and commemorations in Germany before and during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. A <a href="German%20destroyer%20Z10%20Hans%20Lody">destroyer ship</a> bore his name.

Carl Hans Lody was born in Berlin on 20 January 1877. His father was a lawyer in government service who served as mayor of <a href="Oderberg">Oderberg</a> in 1881. The Lody family subsequently moved to <a href="Nordhausen">Nordhausen</a>, where they lived at 8 Sedanstrasse (today Rudolf-Breitscheid-Strasse). Lody's father served as deputy mayor there in 1882 but died in June 1883 after a short illness and his mother died in 1885. He was fostered for a time by a couple in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> before entering the orphanage of the <a href="Francke%20Foundations">Francke Foundations</a> in nearby <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>.

Lody began an apprenticeship at a grocery store in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join the crew of the sailing ship "Sirius" as a <a href="cabin%20boy">cabin boy</a>. He studied at the maritime academy in <a href="Geestem%C3%BCnde">Geestemünde</a>, qualifying as a <a href="helmsman">helmsman</a>, and immediately afterwards served with the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>." An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my doctor told me that I could not go any further."
Lody found alternative employment with the <a href="Hamburg%20America%20Line">Hamburg America Line</a>, which had inaugurated a personally guided tour service for wealthy travellers going from Europe to America. Lody became a tour guide responsible for looking after these clients, and in this capacity visited European countries, including Britain. During one such tour he met a German-American woman named Louise Storz, the 23-year-old adoptive daughter of a wealthy beer brewer, <a href="Gottlieb%20Storz">Gottlieb Storz</a> of <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>. Louise's tour included several European countries, including Germany; by its conclusion she and Lody were engaged. After visiting Lody's family in Berlin, the couple travelled to the United States. They were married on 29 October 1912 in what the "Omaha Daily Bee" described as "a 'society' wedding":

Despite the high profile of the wedding the couple lived together for only two months. Lody sought to obtain a position in the <a href="Storz%20Brewing%20Company">Storz Brewing Company</a> but he lacked expertise in brewing. As the local "Omaha Daily Bee" newspaper put it, "Here he was in the United States with a wife to support and no position in sight." He found a job working as a clerk for the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a> for under $100 a month. Two months after they were married, Louise brought suit for divorce, charging that Lody had "beat[en] her, inflicting serious wounds to her body." Lody left for Berlin shortly thereafter; over six months later, he unexpectedly returned with a German lawyer to contest the suit in the <a href="Douglas%20County%2C%20Nebraska">Douglas County</a> courts. The suit was withdrawn without explanation a few days later; Lody returned to Berlin. The two sides apparently reached an amicable settlement; in February 1914 the divorce suit was reinstated and Lody agreed not to contest it. The divorce was granted the following month.

The military historian <a href="Thomas%20Boghardt">Thomas Boghardt</a> suggests that the Storz family did not approve of the match, and may have pressured the couple to separate. Lody said later that his former father-in-law gave him $10,000, possibly as compensation. The failed marriage had a lasting effect on Lody. He wrote in 1914: "My feelings run riot when I can permit myself to review the dramatic events of the last three years and what is to be the probable climax of it all."

On his return to Germany, Lody settled in Berlin, living in what he described as "well to do circumstances". He stayed in the <a href="Adlon%20Hotel">Adlon</a>, the city's most fashionable luxury hotel, while his sister Hanna lived with her doctor husband in the prosperous suburb of <a href="Westend%20%28Berlin%29">Westend</a> in <a href="Charlottenburg">Charlottenburg</a>. As tensions grew across Europe in the first half of 1914, German naval intelligence – the <a href="Nachrichten-Abteilung">Nachrichten-Abteilung</a>, or "N" – set out to recruit potential agents. Lody already had links with the service. During his time with the Imperial German Navy, Lody had served under Arthur Tapken, who later became N's first director. The <a href="German%20Imperial%20Admiralty%20Staff">German Imperial Admiralty Staff</a>, or "Admiralstab", listed Lody as a possible recruitment target before the outbreak of war. The naval authorities regarded Hamburg America Line (HAL) employees such as Lody as ideal recruits because of their expertise in naval matters and presence in ports worldwide. The HAL had collaborated with the Admiralstab since the 1890s. The relationship became so close that in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the war, the HAL's director Albert Ballin told the Admiralstab that he would "place myself and the organisation subordinate to me at your Excellency's disposal as best as possible."
On 8 May 1914, Fritz Prieger, the director of N, contacted Lody to ask whether he was willing to serve as a naval agent. Lody replied that he was "honoured" by Prieger's trust and would serve at Prieger's disposal. Within three weeks Lody had signed a formal agreement to operate as a "tension traveller" in southern France – an agent who would report back to Berlin in times of heightened international tensions. The <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a> on 28 June and the subsequent <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> precipitated the outbreak of World War I on 28 July.

With the United Kingdom declaring war in support of France and Belgium, Prieger sent Lody to Britain as a war agent. Lody was ordered to base himself in the <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>–<a href="Leith">Leith</a> area and monitor British naval movements. He was to travel along the Scottish coast and report on the warships stationed there; "If or when Mr. Lody comes to know that a naval battle has taken place, he will enquire as much and unobtrusively as possible regarding losses, damage etc." His orders reflected the Admiralstab's belief that the war would be decided by a single major naval battle.

To communicate with his handlers, Lody was instructed to write to certain addresses in <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> (now Oslo), <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. He acquired an American emergency passport in the name of Charles A. Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing – lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors at N. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 <a href="Danish%20krone">Danish krone</a> and 1,000 <a href="Norwegian%20krone">Norwegian krone</a> to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.

<a href="Gustav%20Steinhauer">Gustav Steinhauer</a>, the head of N's British section, later wrote that he had met Lody shortly before the latter's departure, and spoken with him on a couple of occasions. Steinhauer had been active in Britain shortly before the outbreak of war, and was keen to give Lody advice on the difficulties he would face:

To Steinhauer's apparent surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant about the danger that he was about to go into. "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," Lody said, according to Steinhauer; "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." At a final meeting at the <a href="Anhalter%20Bahnhof">Anhalter Bahnhof</a> in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody "only laughed at me and told me my fears were groundless." Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as "practically nil" and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that "as he had specially volunteered for the task – and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him – they allowed him to go."

As Steinhauer noted in his autobiography, the UK was a dangerous environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country had not had a dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain <a href="Vernon%20Kell">Vernon Kell</a> and Lieutenant-Commander <a href="Mansfield%20Cumming">Mansfield Cumming</a>. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, <a href="MI5">MI5</a> and <a href="MI6">MI6</a>. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.

Lody embarked on his mission "so hastily that he did not even have time to learn a code that might have assisted him to get his messages through", according to Steinhauer Posing as an American tourist, Lody left Berlin on 14 August, travelling via Denmark to the Norwegian port of <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>. There he boarded a ship that took him to <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>, arriving on the evening of 27 August. He took a train to the North British Hotel (now the <a href="Balmoral%20Hotel">Balmoral Hotel</a>) adjacent to <a href="Edinburgh%20Waverley%20railway%20station">Edinburgh Waverley railway station</a>. On 30 August, he sent a telegram from Edinburgh's main post office to an Adolf Burchard at 4 <a href="Drottninggatan">Drottninggatan</a>, Stockholm – a cover address for a German agent in Sweden. The message said: "Must cancel Johnson very ill last four days shall leave shortly" and was signed "Charles". As it was an overseas telegram, he had to sign for it with his full (alias) name.

The Secret Service Bureau's counter-espionage section had by now become part of the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>'s Directorate of Military Operations and was known as . At the outbreak of war it instituted widespread censorship of letters and telegrams sent abroad. From 4 August all mails from the UK to Norway and Sweden had been brought to London for examination to identify any being sent to suspect addresses. Fatally for Lody, was already aware that the Stockholm address was that of a German agent, and was watching for correspondence using the "Johnson" formula employed in Lody's telegram. "Burchard" was later identified as a German agent by the name of K. Leipziger. After Lody sent his telegram to "Burchard", exposing his "Charles Inglis" alias on the telegram form, Letter Interception Unit conducted a back-tracking exercise to find any other messages sent to the same place. One of censors later described the scene at Salisbury House in London, where the Letter Interception Unit was based:

The "Johnson" telegram reached its destination and was only identified retrospectively by the British authorities. It was said to have indicated the presence of four British battleships, though the censors took its meaning to be that "he was being watched and in danger & would have to leave Edinburgh which he did later on."

Having inadvertently exposed his assumed identity, Lody's subsequent communications came under close scrutiny by . He left his Edinburgh hotel on 1 September, and moved to a boarding-house in Drumsheugh Gardens, where he gave his name as Charles A. Inglis of New York City and paid as a weekly boarder. Three days later he sent a letter in English to the same Stockholm address, enclosing an envelope with a second letter, in German and addressed to Berlin. This was intercepted by the British authorities, opened, photographed, sealed again and sent on to Sweden. A post-war report by MI5, the successor organisation to , explains that it was treated this way "in the hope of learning more."
In this instance was happy to let Lody's letters go through as they contained information that was wildly misleading and caused serious (and needless) worry to the German High Command. Lody had heard the widespread rumour that thousands of Russian troops with "snow on their boots" had passed through Scotland en route to the Western Front, and relayed it to his controllers in Berlin:

Lody's information was entirely inaccurate and had been gleaned, as he was to admit at his trial, purely from rumours: "I heard it in the boarding-house and I heard it in the barber's shop." His second letter, in German, was addressed to "Herr Stammer" at German naval intelligence in Courbierestrasse, Berlin, and contained details of British naval losses and vessels stationed at <a href="Leith">Leith</a> and <a href="Grangemouth">Grangemouth</a>. He had obtained details of the naval vessels simply by climbing <a href="Calton%20Hill">Calton Hill</a> in Edinburgh and observing the panorama from the summit, and by taking a promenade along the seafront at Grangemouth, used by thousands of citizens as a popular excursion. He was worried about the risks that he was taking and stated in his letter that he would not go near any place where he could be challenged, or where barricades and restrictions prevented access. His lack of training or preparation meant that these letters, like all of his communications, were written with no attempt at concealment whatsoever – no code or invisible ink – and were composed entirely "en clair" in ordinary written English or German.

On 7 September, Lody went to a cycle shop at Haymarket Terrace to hire a bicycle. He told the owner's daughter that he was an American from New York who was sojourning in Edinburgh after the outbreak of war had spoiled a holiday in Europe. He was staying there for a few days while he waited for a berth to become available on a ship to America, as all the transatlantic vessels were fully booked with returnees. He said that he wanted to cycle to places around Edinburgh such as <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> and <a href="South%20Queensferry">Queensferry</a> and arranged to hire a bicycle. The owner's daughter warned him that some roads were now guarded and he should stop immediately if challenged by a sentry, to which he replied, "Oh, I am only going to be cycling about for pleasure!"

For the next week, Lody followed a routine of staying in his room until noon, going out for the afternoon and returning between 5 and 7 pm. He sometimes went out on his bicycle again in the evening. He spent his time looking for information and on 14 September sent a second envelope to Stockholm. This time it was merely a wrapper containing a second envelope, inside which was a letter addressed to the editor of a Berlin newspaper, "Ullstein Verlag", in which Lody said:

This too was intercepted and photographed but, as it was a relatively harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it – it was never found by the British – as he felt that it was poorly written.

Lody returned to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross</a> to Edinburgh. He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card and talked with her a while before going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth and the other a sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: "What country are you? Are you from the other side?" Lody replied, "Yes, I am an American." They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser <a href="HMS%20Pathfinder%20%281904%29">HMS "Pathfinder"</a>, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, "We are going to put out mines as the Germans have done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the smoking car.
Lody went back to his lodgings at Drumsheugh Gardens and continued to walk and cycle around the area. He made the acquaintance of two girls he met on <a href="Princes%20Street">Princes Street</a> and went out with them on a couple of evenings. He gave up cycling after an accident on 25 September, in which he collided with a bicycle being ridden by one of his landlady's friends while riding from <a href="Peebles">Peebles</a> to Edinburgh, causing her "some little injury". He returned his damaged bicycle to the shop where he had rented it.

On 27 September, Lody wrote another letter in German to "Burchard", enclosing press cuttings about the chivalry of British seamen and the sinking of the cruisers <a href="HMS%20Aboukir%20%281900%29">HMS "Aboukir"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Cressy%20%281899%29">"Cressy"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Hogue%20%281900%29">"Hogue"</a>. The letter included a good deal of detailed information about naval movements and fortifications, such as the artillery defences of <a href="North%20Berwick">North Berwick</a>, <a href="Kinghorn">Kinghorn</a> and <a href="North%20Queensferry">North</a> and South Queensferry. It was clear by now to Lody that his mission was not going successfully. The decisive naval battle that the German Admiralty had anticipated had not happened, and Lody was becoming increasingly fearful for his personal security. He said later:

The environment in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had stayed there for more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to <a href="Redford%20Barracks">Redford Barracks</a> under the escort of a soldier ... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.

Lody left his boarding-house hastily on the morning of 27 September and stayed overnight at the Roxburgh Hotel in Edinburgh. He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought a ticket to Ireland and took the SS "Munster" to Dublin via <a href="D%C3%BAn%20Laoghaire">Kingstown</a> (now Dún Laoghaire). It stopped at <a href="Holyhead">Holyhead</a> in <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, where an immigration official challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to demonstrate his "bona fides", and he proceeded on his way.

Lody's controllers realised that his mission was not going according to plan and attempted to get in touch with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never have been aware of it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.

During his journey to Ireland, Lody met a <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> doctor, John William Lee, who had been studying eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the <a href="RMS%20Baltic">RMS "Baltic"</a>, leaving <a href="Cobh">Queenstown</a> (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended to spend a few days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that it would probably be the <a href="Gresham%20Hotel">Gresham Hotel</a> on <a href="O%27Connell%20Street">Sackville Street</a>, to which Lody replied, "All right, let's go there." They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, and that it would be hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in <a href="Phoenix%20Park">Phoenix Park</a>.

While Lee was exchanging some money at Thomas Cook on 30 September, Lody wrote a further letter in German to "Burchard", clarifying his reasons for coming to Ireland and describing what he had seen on his journey. He explained:

Lody described anti-<a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> precautions he had heard about in London and provided details of the conversions of the <a href="Cunard%20Line">Cunard Line</a> steamships <a href="RMS%20Aquitania">RMS "Aquitania"</a> and <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">"Lusitania"</a> for their wartime service, which he had seen while in Liverpool. Once again the letter was intercepted by the British and not allowed to go forward to Stockholm. Lody and Lee spent another evening in Dublin before going on a day-trip by coach to <a href="Glendalough">Glendalough</a> to see the lough and the surrounding countryside. On 2 October they parted with an agreement to meet again in Killarney the following day. Lee travelled to <a href="Drogheda">Drogheda</a>, where he stayed overnight, while Lody went straight to Killarney and found a room at the Great Southern Hotel (now the Malton Hotel).

Lody was unaware that his latest letters had galvanised the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content of his most recent letters caused them to consider him now to be a serious threat. It did not take them long to catch up with him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.

While Lody was travelling to Killarney on the morning of 2 October, an Edinburgh City Police detective was ordered to enquire at hotels for a person named Inglis. The detective found that Lody had stayed at the Roxburgh Hotel and was shown his luggage, which still had a label attached bearing the name and address Charles A. Inglis, Bedford House, 12 Drumsheugh Gardens. An interview with the proprietor of the boarding-house where Lody had stayed enabled the police to reconstruct his movements, while the manageress of the Roxburgh was able to tell them that he had gone to Ireland.

The police sent a report to Lieutenant-Colonel Vernon Kell of on the same day to summarise their findings, and put a constant watch on the Roxburgh in case Lody returned. In the meantime, contacted the Irish Sea ports to find whether Lody had passed through them. Affirmative answers came back from Liverpool and Holyhead. Later that same afternoon sent a telegram to the Assistant Inspector General of the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a> in Dublin, which read:

The RIC made the investigation a top priority and replied to London at 7.23 pm on 2 October:

At 9.45 pm, District Inspector Cheeseman of the RIC arrived at the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney with a group of constables. He found Lody's name in the visitors' book and went to his room, but did not find him there. Returning to the foyer, Cheeseman saw Lody entering the hotel. He said: "Mr. Inglis, I presume?" to which Lody replied, "Yes, what do you want?" Cheeseman asked him to come to his hotel room and noted that Lody looked upset and frightened. He arrested Lody under the provisions of the <a href="Defence%20of%20the%20Realm%20Act%201914">Defence of the Realm Act 1914</a> (DORA) as a suspected German agent, prompting Lody to exclaim, "What is this? Me, a German agent? Take care now; I am an American citizen." When he was searched, his American identity documents were found along with £14 in German gold, 705 Norwegian krone and a small notebook. The latter listed British ships that had been sunk in the North Sea, names and addresses in Hamburg and Berlin and a possible cypher key. It also included copies of the four letters that he had sent to Stockholm. His bag contained a jacket that contained a tailor's ticket reading "J. Steinberg, Berlin, C.H. Lody, 8.5.14".

Throughout all this, Lody's demeanour was relatively calm after the initial shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but admitted that he had never met a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.

Lee was also arrested but was released without charge after two days when the investigation cleared him of any involvement in Lody's espionage. He complained about his treatment and the British authorities' refusal to let him see an American consul, and promised to take the matter up with the US State Department on his return. An officer named R.H. Price smoothed things over with him on his release on 4 October, explaining what had prompted his arrest and paying his fare back to his hotel. Price reported, "I think he was quite soothed and he shook hands with me on parting." Lee was unaware that the police had already recommended that both he and "Inglis" should be court-martialled and shot if found guilty.

Lody was taken back to London where he was detained in <a href="Wellington%20Barracks">Wellington Barracks</a> under the watch of the 3rd Battalion, the <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a>. A meeting of the Cabinet on 8 October decided to try him for "<a href="war%20treason">war treason</a>", a decision that has been described as "legally, very curious" by the legal historian <a href="A.%20W.%20B.%20Simpson">A. W. B. Simpson</a>. He was not charged with espionage under either of the two relevant statutes, the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act%201911">Official Secrets Act 1911</a> or DORA. The principal reason lay in the wording of the <a href="Hague%20Conventions%20of%201899%20and%201907">Hague Convention of 1907</a>, which states: "A person can only be considered a spy when, acting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party." Lody was operating in the British Isles, outside the zone of operations, and was therefore not covered by this definition. Such circumstances had been anticipated by the most recent edition of the British "Manual of Military Law", published in February 1914, which recommended that individuals in such cases should be tried for war treason: "Indeed in every case where it is doubtful whether the act consists of espionage, once the fact is established that an individual has furnished or attempted to furnish information to the enemy, no time need be wasted in examining whether the case corresponds exactly to the definition of espionage."

War treason as defined by the "Manual" covered a very wide range of offences, including "obtaining, supplying and carrying of information to the enemy" or attempting to do so. Its application in Lody's case, rather than the government relying on DORA, was the result of a misunderstanding by the War Office. It had been misinformed in August 1914 that an unidentified German had been captured with a radio transmitter and interned in <a href="Bodmin%20Jail">Bodmin Prison</a>. In fact, no such person existed, but the story led <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a>, the Secretary of State for War, to ask the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Richard%20Haldane%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Haldane">Lord Haldane</a>, for advice on how the supposed spy should be dealt with. Haldane stated that the individual should be put before a court martial and executed if found guilty. He wrote:

This theory was relied upon by the Cabinet and the <a href="Army%20Council%20%281904%29">Army Council</a>, which ordered on 9 August that Lody was to be tried by a court martial. There was some confusion about whether Haldane had really meant a court martial rather than a military tribunal, and the <a href="Adjutant%20General">Adjutant General</a> questioned whether DORA had limited the maximum punishment for espionage to penal servitude for life, rather than the death penalty. Further confusion was caused by the fact that Lody's identity had not yet been fully established. If he really was an American citizen, he was not an "alien belligerent" and could not be court martialled.

On 21 October 1914 the Cabinet decided that Lody should be handed over to the civil police and tried by the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a>. After Lody then made a statement voluntarily admitting his real name and his status as a German subject, the Cabinet determined the following day that the original plan would be followed after all. The venue for the court martial was to be the <a href="Middlesex%20Guildhall">Middlesex Guildhall</a> in <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a>; Major General <a href="Herbert%20Eaton%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Cheylesmore">Lord Cheylesmore</a> would preside, sitting with eight other officers. In hindsight, according to Simpson, it is doubtful whether the charge and eventual sentence were lawful. A later revision of the "Manual of Military Law" rejected the view that a spy commits a war crime and alluded to the Lody case in suggesting that war treason was not an applicable charge in such cases. Simpson comments that "it is fairly plain that Lody's execution was unlawful under domestic and international law." This objection was not raised during Lody's trial but it would not have done him any good in any case, as there was no appeal for a decision made by a court martial. In the event, Lody's trial was unique. No other spies captured in Britain were tried for war treason under international law. DORA was amended in November 1914 to permit a death sentence to be imposed. All of the subsequent 26 courts martial of accused spies were heard under DORA, resulting in 10 executions.

Another question that arose was whether Lody's trial should be held in public or "<a href="in%20camera">in camera</a>". Captain Reginald Drake, head of counter-espionage, wanted Lody to be tried secretly so that he could implement "an ingenious method for conveying false information to the enemy which depended on their not knowing which of their agents had been caught." He was overruled, as the British Government believed that it would be more advantageous to publicise the threat of German spies to remove any doubt in the public mind that German espionage posed a serious threat in the UK. It was hoped that this would also generate support for the intelligence and censorship apparatus that was rapidly taking shape and would deter possible imitators. In the event, Lody's was the only spy trial in either World War held in public in the UK. In pursuing this policy the Government sacrificed the chance to "turn" captured spies and turn them into assets for the British intelligence services. It was an opportunity that was taken in the Second World War when the highly successful <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Double-Cross System</a> was implemented.

The court martial was held over three days between Friday 30 October and Monday 2 November. Lody was charged with two offences of war treason concerning the two letters he had sent from Edinburgh on 27 September and Dublin on 30 September. In both letters, the charge sheet stated that Lody had sought "to convey to a belligerent enemy of Great Britain, namely Germany" information relating to the UK's defences and preparations for war. He pleaded not guilty to both charges. He made an immediate impression on observers when he first appeared in court. The "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" reporter described him as:

Sir <a href="Archibald%20Bodkin">Archibald Bodkin</a>, the <a href="Director%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>, set out the case for the prosecution. The evidence was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's notebook and the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house in which he had stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she "was asked if she could see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [she] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while he smiled broadly and almost broke into laughter at the absurdity of the situation."

Late on 30 October, Lody wrote to a friend in Omaha to tell him about his feelings before he began his defence. He told his friend:

The second day of the trial was interrupted when a young man whom "The Times" described as being "of foreign appearance" was arrested and removed from the court on the orders of Captain <a href="Reginald%20Hall">Reginald "Blinker" Hall</a>, the Director of Naval Intelligence. The interloper was one Charles Stuart Nairne, an Irishman and former Royal Navy lieutenant whom Hall spotted in the public gallery and considered to be "either a lunatic or a very dangerous person". As Nairne was being removed into military custody, he attempted to shake Lody's hand in the dock.

Lody was then called to give evidence. It was revealed to the public for the first time that he was an officer in the Imperial German Navy and that he had been ordered by a superior officer to spy in Britain. When he was asked for the name of that individual, his composure temporarily deserted him, as "The Times" reporter recorded:

Lody stated that he had been sent to the UK "to remain until the first [naval] encounter had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an "in camera" session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." His services were provided "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy – oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." He claimed that he had "pledged my word of honour" not to name his controller.

Little of this was true, but at the time the British had no way of knowing this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was approached by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.

On the final day of the court martial, 2 November 1914, the prosecution and defence put forward their final arguments. Lody's counsel argued for mitigation on the grounds that Lody had "[come] to this country actuated by patriotic German motives, entirely paying his own expenses and carrying his life in his hands, to fulfil the mandate of his supporters." As one newspaper report put it,

The finding of guilt and sentence of death were pronounced "in camera", without Lody present, before the court martial was adjourned.

No public announcement was made of the court martial's verdict. Instead, the following day, the <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> <a href="London%20District%20%28British%20Army%29">London District</a> was sent instructions ordering the sentence to be promulgated on 5 November, with Lody being told, and for the sentence to be carried out at least 18 hours later. Great secrecy surrounded the proceedings which, when combined with the short timeframe, caused problems for the GOC in finding a suitable place of execution. He contacted Major-General Henry Pipon, the Major of the Tower of London, to tell him:

While the Tower may have been "the only possible place", in some respects it was a strange choice. It had not been used as a state prison for many years and the last execution there – that of <a href="Simon%20Fraser%2C%2011th%20Lord%20Lovat">Lord Lovat</a>, the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> rebel – had taken place in 1747. It was one of London's most popular tourist attractions, recording over 400,000 visitors a year by the end of the 19th century, and remained open to tourists even on the day of Lody's execution. During the Tower's heyday, executions had been carried out in the open air on <a href="Tower%20Hill">Tower Hill</a> or <a href="Tower%20Green">Tower Green</a>, but Lody's execution was to take place at the Tower's rifle range located in the eastern part of the Outer Ward between Martin and Constable Towers, behind the Outer Curtain wall and out of public sight. The Tower's custodians, the <a href="Yeomen%20Warders">Yeomen Warders</a> ("Beefeaters"), had long since become tourist guides rather than active-duty soldiers, so eight men were selected from the 3rd Battalion, to carry out the sentence.

Lody was informed of his impending execution on the evening of 5 November and was brought to the Tower in a police van. According to the "Daily Express", he "received the news calmly and with no sign of surprise." He was held in the Casemates on the west side of the Tower, an area where the Yeoman Warders now live. His last meal was probably prepared by one of the Warders' wives, as the Tower had no proper accommodation or dining facilities for prisoners. While at the Tower he wrote a couple of final letters. One was addressed to the Commanding Officer of the 3rd Battalion to thank his captors for their care of him:

The Guards apparently never saw the letter; the Adjutant General instead directed the letter to be placed in a War Office file rather than being sent to the regiment.

Lody also wrote a letter to his sister, which was published posthumously in the "<a href="Frankfurter%20Zeitung">Frankfurter Zeitung</a>" newspaper, in which he told her and his other relatives:

Lody also left instructions that his ring was to be forwarded to his ex-wife, which was carried out after his execution.

At dawn on the morning of 6 November 1914, in cold, foggy and bleak weather, Lody was fetched from his cell by the Assistant Provost-Marshal, <a href="James%20Somerville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Athlumney">Lord Athlumney</a>. He asked, "I suppose that you will not care to shake hands with a German spy?", to which the reply came, "No. But I will shake hands with a brave man." A small procession formed up for the short journey to the rifle range, comprising Lody and his armed escort, the Tower's Chaplain and the eight-man firing squad. John Fraser, one of the Yeoman Warders, witnessed it and later described it:

At the rifle range Lody was strapped into a chair. He refused to have his eyes bandaged, as he wished to die with his eyes open. A few moments later the inhabitants of the Tower heard "the muffled sound of a single volley". His body was taken away to be buried in an unmarked grave in the <a href="East%20London%20Cemetery">East London Cemetery</a> in <a href="Plaistow%2C%20Newham">Plaistow</a>. The War Office issued a terse announcement of the execution a few days later on 10 November: "Sentence is duly confirmed." 

Lody's courageous demeanour in court produced widespread sympathy and admiration, a development that neither side had anticipated. Even his captors were captivated; although had recommended his execution as early as 3 October, by the time the trial was over, Kell was said by his wife to have considered Lody a "really fine man" of whom Kell "felt it deeply that so brave a man should have to pay the death penalty for carrying out what he considered to be his duty to his country." Sir <a href="Basil%20Thomson">Basil Thomson</a> of <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> commented that "there was some difference of opinion as to whether it was sound policy to execute spies and to begin with a patriotic spy like Lody." According to Robert Jackson, the biographer of Lody's prosecutor Sir Archibald Bodkin, Lody's "bearing and frankness when caught so impressed Britain's spy-catchers and prosecutors that they talked about trying to get the Government to waive the internationally recognised rule that spies caught in wartime automatically are put to death. Only the certainty that Germany would not be as merciful to our own spies made them refrain." Thomson also paid tribute to Lody in his 1937 book "The Scene Changes":

Lody's conduct was contrasted favourably with the German spies captured after him, many of whom were nationals of neutral countries, who followed him to the execution chair. Lady Constance Kell commented that "most of the agents employed by the Germans worked only for the money they gained and were regarded with utter contempt". Similarly, Thomson described "the scum of neutral spies", of whom he said, "we came to wish that a distinction could have been made between patriotic spies like Lody and the hirelings who pestered us through the ensuing years". Shortly after Lody's death he was described in the House of Commons as "a patriot who had died for his country as much as any soldier who fell in the field."

The British and German publics also took a positive view of Lody. His trial became something of a celebrity occasion; as "The New York Times" observed, on the first day, "many fashionably dressed women thronged the galleries of the courtroom" and the final day was attended by "many leaders of London society as well as by prominent jurists, politicians, and military and naval men." The "Daily Express" opined that "one cannot withhold a tribute to his daring resourcefulness and inflexible courage" and called Lody "one of the cleverest spies in Steinhauer's service", though it advised its readers to bear in mind that he was "a most dangerous spy."

Louise Storz, Lody's former wife, received his ring in early December along with a letter from him. She refused to disclose its contents, saying, "It is his last message to me and in no way concerns anyone else. The ring had also been our wedding ring." She spoke of her reaction to his death in an interview in November 1914 with "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>" while visiting <a href="Excelsior%20Springs%2C%20Missouri">Excelsior Springs, Missouri</a>. She said:

Her father refused to comment, saying that his interest in the Lody case was "only a passing one". A rumour had it that the German government paid Louise Storz $15,000 in compensation for her ex-husband's death, but she denied this in 1915.

In Germany, Lody's home town of Nordhausen planted an oak tree in his memory. Newspaper commentary was limited; the first article about the case that "The Times" noted was only published around 19 November, in the "Frankfurter Zeitung", in which a pseudonymous columnist suggested that the British might have been tempted to show Lody mercy: "I myself am convinced that the noble manliness with which this strong German composure bore itself before the Court touched the heart of the Judge, that the Judge said "If only we English had many such Hans Lodys!" and that Hans Lody lives ... We shall not forget him, for he staked his country more than his life – his name and his honour." A death notice was published in early December in the "<a href="Stuttgarter%20Neues%20Tagblatt">Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt</a>", stating that he had "died the hero's death for the Fatherland in England, November 6".

Lody's death produced a low-key response from the German government. The Admiralstab recommended at the end of 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a>, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.

The bravery Lody exhibited during his trial and execution was praised by many post-war British writers. Sir George Aston, writing in his 1930 book "Secret Service", called on his readers to "pay a tribute to a real German spy of the highest type ... Karl Lody", while John Bulloch commented in his 1963 history of MI5 that Lody's bearing made him "something of a hero even in the country against which he was working." E.T. Woodhall, a former detective, collected accounts from officers who had been involved in the investigation and wrote in 1932: "They are unanimous in their admiration for his manly and brazen qualities, but they all criticise his amazing lack of caution ... He was admired by everybody for his bravery and straightforward, patriotic devotion to his country."

Lody may have had more complex motives than simple patriotism. Thomas Boghardt notes the "exceptional" way in which Lody bore himself at his trial, pointing out that "virtually all other German agents accused of espionage understandably tried to deny or minimise their involvement with N". Boghardt had the advantage of being able to review the Admiralstab's files on the case and highlights "small but important changes", or rather discrepancies, between Lody's statements in court and the facts preserved in the case files. As Boghardt puts it,

Lody, suggests Boghardt, "had accepted his trial and probable execution as a form of expiation for events that had occurred long before his becoming a secret agent." He raises the possibility that Lody was motivated by what had happened two years earlier in Omaha, when Lody had responded to the accusations of being a wife-beater by declaring that he would "defend the honour of a gentleman". Boghardt comments that "his eagerness to display his honour may indicate a concern that others doubted this very quality in him. While presenting himself to the world as a man of honour and accepting his fate courageously, Lody may have found comfort and strength in the thought that whoever had doubted his honour previously would now be persuade otherwise."

During the Nazi era, Lody's memory was appropriated by the new regime to promote a more muscular image of German patriotism. An elaborate commemoration of his death was held in Lübeck on 6 November 1934, when flags across the city flew at half-mast and bells tolled between 6.45 and 7 am, the time of his execution. Later that day a memorial was unveiled at the Burgtor gateway near the harbour, depicting a knight in armour with a closed visor (representing Lody), with his hands fettered (representing captivity) and a serpent entwining his feet (representing betrayal). Below it an inscription was set into the gate's brickwork, reading "CARL HANS LODY starb für uns 6.11.1914 im Tower zu London" ("Carl Hans Lody died for us 6.11.1914 in the Tower of London").

During the unveiling ceremony, which was attended by Lody's sister and representatives of the present Reichsmarine and old Imperial German Navy, the road leading from the gateway to the harbour was also renamed "Karl-Hans-Lody-Weg". On the same day, officers from the Hamburg-America Line presented city officials with a ship's bell bearing the inscription "In Memory of Karl Hans Lody", to be rung each 6 November at the time of his death. After World War II, when Lübeck was part of the British Zone of Occupation, the statue was taken down and the niche in which it stood was bricked up, though the inscription was allowed to remain and is still visible today.

Lody was further memorialised in 1937 when the newly launched destroyer "<a href="German%20destroyer%20Z10%20Hans%20Lody">Z10</a>" was christened "Hans Lody". Other ships in the same class were also given the names of German officers who had died in action. The ship served throughout the Second World War in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> theatres, survived the war and was captured by the British in 1945. After a few years in <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> service she was scrapped in <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in 1949.

Lody was also the subject of literary and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, "Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre" ("Lody – One Way to Honour"), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called "Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers" ("Lody: the life and death of a German officer"), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: "I shall see Germany once more – from the stars." The Dundee "Evening Telegraph" described the storyline as "quaint".

The <a href="Gollanczstra%C3%9Fe">Lodystraße</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> was named in his honour.

The 17-year-old <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> wrote a eulogy to Lody in 1915 in which he imagined the purpose behind the spy's death:

The reality was very different. Lody's body was buried in an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with seventeen other men – ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed out that a licence for exhumation would have to be authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.

In September 1937 the German government again requested that Lody's body be exhumed and moved to a separate grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; he had been buried with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">British Imperial War Graves Commission</a> suggested that a memorial should be constructed in another part of the cemetery to bear the names of all the German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombs. It was replaced in 1974.

One further proposal was made to rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at <a href="Cannock%20Chase%20German%20war%20cemetery">Cannock Chase</a> in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. The <a href="German%20War%20Graves%20Commission">German War Graves Commission</a> (VDK) asked if it would be possible to disinter Lody's body and move it to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was told that it would not be possible to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The proposal was abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.

Mercy Point

Mercy Point is an American <a href="Science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> <a href="medical%20drama">medical drama</a>, created by <a href="Trey%20Callaway">Trey Callaway</a>, David Simkins, and Milo Frank, which originally aired for one season on <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) from October 6, 1998, to July 15, 1999. With an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a> led by <a href="Joe%20Morton">Joe Morton</a>, <a href="Maria%20del%20Mar%20%28actress%29">Maria del Mar</a>, <a href="Alexandra%20Wilson">Alexandra Wilson</a>, <a href="Brian%20McNamara">Brian McNamara</a>, <a href="Salli%20Richardson">Salli Richardson</a>, Julia Pennington, Gay Thomas, <a href="Jordan%20Lund">Jordan Lund</a>, and <a href="Joe%20Spano">Joe Spano</a>, the series focuses on the doctors and nurses in a 23rd-century hospital space station located in deep space. The executive producers were Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders.

Callaway adapted "Mercy Point" from his original screenplay, "Nightingale One". It was picked up by Mandalay Television, and the concept was eventually revised as a television project and renamed "Mercy Point"; production on the film project had ended due to the poor commercial performance of the 1997 film <a href="Starship%20Troopers%20%28film%29">"Starship Troopers"</a>. The television show was part of a three-million-dollar deal between Mandalay and Columbia TriStar Television to produce 200 hours of material. It was filmed in Vancouver to reduce production costs, the hospital sets being constructed on a series of <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s. Director <a href="Joe%20Napolitano">Joe Napolitano</a> has praised the show for its use of a complete set to allow for more intricate directing. Despite Callaway envisioning "Mercy Point" as a companion to "", it was paired with "<a href="Moesha">Moesha</a>" and <a href="Clueless%20%28TV%20series%29">"Clueless"</a> as its <a href="Block%20programming">lead-in</a> on <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">Tuesday nights</a>. Initially focused on ethical and medical cases, the show's storylines gradually shifted toward relating the characters' personal relationships, to better fit UPN's primarily teen demographic.

"Mercy Point" was placed on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was replaced by the reality television series "America's Greatest Pets" and the sitcom "<a href="Reunited%20%28TV%20series%29">Reunited</a>". The show suffered from low ratings, with an average of two million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to "Mercy Point" was mixed; some <a href="Television%20criticism">commentators</a> praised its characterization and use of science-fiction elements, while others found it to be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway stated that he had the potential story arcs for the full first season already planned before the show's cancellation.

Set in the year 2249, "Mercy Point" revolves around doctors and nurses working in a hospital space station in deep space. The "state-of-the-art hospital" is described as "the last stop for anything going out, the first stop for anything coming back" by one of the show's characters. It is noted for existing on the "fringes of the galaxy", on a colony called Jericho. The facility includes advanced medical equipment, such as "artificial wombs, holographic three-dimensional X-ray projections [and] zero-gravity operating tables". A talking computer known as Hippocrates, voiced by series co-creator <a href="Trey%20Callaway">Trey Callaway</a>, is shown as the primary method to monitor a patient's status.

The doctors and nurses work on both human and extraterrestrial patients over the course of the series. In the series, the medical staff is referred to as "med-nauts". Despite the futuristic setting, the characters' clothing and hairstyles adhere to <a href="1990s%20in%20fashion">1990s fashion</a> trends. In Frank Garcia and Mark Phillips' book "Science Fiction Television Series, 1990–2004", they compared the concept behind the show to <a href="James%20White%20%28author%29">James White</a>'s "<a href="Sector%20General">Sector General</a>" series, <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s stories about a doctor who travels to different planets, and <a href="G.%20Harry%20Stine">G. Harry Stine</a>'s book "Space Doctor". "Mercy Point"'s setting and filming style also received comparisons to the television medical drama <a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">"ER"</a>; the series itself was promoted as ""ER" in space".

According to a press release from <a href="UPN">UPN</a>, the series features the characters' attempts to "balanc[e] complicated personal lives with the demands of working in a cutting-edge hospital". Each episode includes story arcs involving personal and professional problems, the staff's relationships gaining more prominence as the series progressed. Alien physiologist Grote Maxwell (<a href="Joe%20Morton">Joe Morton</a>) works as the facility's lead doctor and surgeon. Senior surgeon Haylen Breslauer (<a href="Maria%20del%20Mar%20%28actress%29">Maria del Mar</a>) directs Maxwell's actions as his boss and best friend. Dru Breslaur (<a href="Alexandra%20Wilson">Alexandra Wilson</a>) begins working at the hospital in the pilot episode, creating tension because of her strained relationship with her older sister Haylen, and her past romance with Dr. C. J. Jurado (<a href="Brian%20McNamara">Brian McNamara</a>). Jurado is characterized through his high <a href="libido">libido</a>, with his story arc involving a love triangle with Dru and his current girlfriend Lieutenant Kim Salisaw (<a href="Salli%20Richardson">Salli Richardson</a>). While working as a doctor, Rema Cooke (Gay Thomas) grows more concerned about her patients' rights.

The <a href="Android%20%28robot%29">android</a> head nurse ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (<a href="Jordan%20Lund">Jordan Lund</a>) also help to combat the frequent medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as "extremely efficient and attractive", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they feel that she sets an impossible standard for them to match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries to learn more about them. Batung, who is part of the slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the <a href="Chief%20of%20staff">Chief of Staff</a> Harris DeMilla (<a href="Joe%20Spano">Joe Spano</a>), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues.

Created by Trey Callaway, <a href="David%20Simkins">David Simkins</a>, and Milo Frank, "Mercy Point" was originally developed as a concept for a feature film. Callaway drew his primary inspiration for the original screenplay from a concept by Frank, entitled "Nightingale One". And while pitching the idea to film executives, Callaway said in his closing comments that he could also envision it as the framework for a successful television series. "Nightingale One" was eventually purchased by <a href="Mandalay%20Entertainment">Mandalay Entertainment</a>, a production company headed by <a href="Peter%20Guber">Peter Guber</a>, but the film's production was stalled after the poor commercial performance of the 1997 film <a href="Starship%20Troopers%20%28film%29">"Starship Troopers"</a>. However, a producer who saw Callaway's original pitch to Mandalay Entertainment's executives decided to reformat "Nightingale One" as a television series based on Callaway's final remarks in the meeting. After the concept's approval for television, "Nightingale One" was renamed "Mercy Point".

During production, Callaway imagined the series as a "companion piece" to "", with the hope that it would have a shared viewership. Even though elements of "Nightingale One" were kept, Callaway said that "[he] really started over again and reconceived it completely as a series from the ground up". Prior to the series being officially <a href="Green-light">green-lit</a>, Callaway collaborated with writer David Simkins to prepare a presentation of a "low-budgeted 30 minute" pilot. Simkins did not work on the series after his pilot, but his contributions earned him a credit as one of its co-creators. <a href="John%20de%20Lancie">John de Lancie</a>, who was noted for acting as <a href="Q%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Q</a> in "", had essayed the role of DeMilla, and <a href="Steve%20Johnson%20%28special%20effects%20artist%29">Steve Johnson</a> designed the non-humanoid aliens. The pilot presentation was filmed in Los Angeles, but the sets were completely renovated for the series' episodes. Three non-humanoid characters, including ANI and Batung, were added to the show following this presentation. UPN executives responded positively to the presentation, and ordered thirteen episodes of the series, which was considered a "half-season's worth". "Mercy Point" was one of four shows produced by Mandalay Television that appeared in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1998–99 United States television schedule</a>, alongside <a href="Cupid%20%281998%20TV%20series%29">"Cupid"</a>, <a href="Rude%20Awakening%20%28TV%20series%29">"Rude Awakening"</a>, and <a href="Oh%20Baby%20%28TV%20series%29">"Oh Baby"</a>. The show's production was part of a three-million-dollar deal with <a href="Columbia%20TriStar%20Television">Columbia TriStar Television</a> to produce 200 hours of material; a majority of the content created from this agreement was commercially unsuccessful.

Callaway carefully chose actors when casting each role. He focused on maintaining the series as a "character-driven plot", to always make "what is going on with people's hearts and minds" more important than special effects. Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later say that he had difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" and "<a href="Stargate%20SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a>," the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on "The X-Files". The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. <a href="Jon%20Ehrlich">Jon Ehrlich</a> composed the show's theme.

The entire series was shot on <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s. Production designers Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a "circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director <a href="Joe%20Napolitano">Joe Napolitano</a> praised the sets while filming the episode "Last Resort", calling the show "a good candy store for a director" due to the functionality and size of the hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct <a href="long%20take">long take</a>s and <a href="walk%20and%20talk">walk and talk</a> sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped around his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as a slug. Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.

Callaway said he was surprised by UPN's cancellation of "Mercy Point" because of their strong support of the show. He felt the decision was made in part because of the show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> resulted in the loss of "Mercy Point"s target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like "<a href="Moesha">Moesha</a>" over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.

In an interview about the series, Callaway said that he had developed complete story arcs for each character for the rest of the first season. Hayden would have continued to deal with feelings of "<a href="homesickness">homesickness</a>", which is defined as "a crippling interstellar condition unique to humans that ultimately linked their survival to returning to Earth" in the context of the show. Batung would have suffered consequences for rejecting "the protective fold of his species", and ANI would develop an antidote for a virus that spread from computers to humans in the pilot episode. Callaway described ANI's future character development as "the ultimate clash between the organic and technological worlds". The status of Grote's missing family would eventually be uncovered after he conducts a rescue mission with C. J. to the "Sahartic Divide". Dru would be confronted by her "old addictions" and Cooke would test her theory that the <a href="temporal%20lobe">temporal lobe</a> houses a human's <a href="soul">soul</a> and is connected with "homesickness".

Following the decision to expand its programming to Thursday and Friday nights, UPN picked up six original series. "Mercy Point" was one of two science fiction television shows picked up by UPN – the second being the time travel-themed <a href="Seven%20Days%20%28TV%20series%29">"Seven Days"</a>. Scott D. Pierce of "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" described the network's choice of two science-fiction dramas and two 19th century programs ("<a href="The%20Secret%20Diary%20of%20Desmond%20Pfeiffer">The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer</a>" and <a href="Legacy%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"Legacy"</a>) as showing "a definite bent toward the unusual". Prior to its premiere, the show was promoted through its inclusion of Joe Morton in a starring role. Although Callaway envisioned "Mercy Point" as a companion to "Star Trek: Voyager", UPN paired the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" installment with "Seven Days" instead. "Mercy Point" was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, following the sitcoms "Moesha" and <a href="Clueless%20%28TV%20series%29">"Clueless"</a>. The "Moesha" and "Clueless" block was held over from the previous year. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"'s Dan Snierson noted that "Mercy Point" faced tough competition from other shows in the same time slot, primarily "<a href="Just%20Shoot%20Me%21">Just Shoot Me!</a>", "<a href="Spin%20City">Spin City</a>", and <a href="Felicity%20%28TV%20series%29">"Felicity"</a>. The series carried a <a href="TV-PG">TV-PG</a> parental rating, meaning that it was judged as "unsuitable for young children".

UPN placed "Mercy Point" on hiatus on October 27, 1998, after the show averaged a rating of 1.5 million viewers. The announcement was made ten days after the series premiere; only three episodes had aired. It was replaced by the reality television series "America's Greatest Pets" and the sitcom "<a href="Reunited%20%28TV%20series%29">Reunited</a>". The show ranked number 157 based on the <a href="Nielsen%20Media%20Research">Nielsen Media Research</a>'s survey of programs airing from September 21, 1998, to May 26, 1999, with an average of two million viewers. It tied with "America's Greatest Pets" and "". Joal Ryan of "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>" wrote that the network's decision was not a surprise given that most viewers were unaware of the show's existence. While reporting on the show's status, Ryan questioned the repeated failures of science-fiction medical dramas. In October 1998, media outlets were reporting that the series might still return to UPN's primetime schedule sometime in the future. The series' final four episodes were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. "Mercy Point" was included on the list of failed medical shows by <a href="The%20Blade%20%28Toledo%2C%20Ohio%29">"The Blade"</a>'s Rob Owen, along with <a href="MDs%20%28TV%20series%29">"MDs"</a> and "<a href="3%20lbs">3 lbs</a>". It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, nor been released on an online-streaming service.

"Mercy Point" has received mixed critical feedback. Prior to the show's premiere, a writer from <a href="SouthCoastToday.com">SouthCoastToday.com</a> wrote that it would appeal to "Star Trek" fans through its use of "portentous dialogue and plenty of gross-out imagery". David Bianculli of "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">The New York Daily News</a>" praised "Mercy Point" as an improvement over "UPN's watch-me-please gimmick shows", and commended the way the show focused on its characters and medical cases while it "relegat[ed] the futuristic elements to the background". "<a href="Milwaukee%20Journal%20Sentinel">The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>"'s Joanne Weintraub favorably compared the show to "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", writing that "both series take their special effects seriously and their often tongue-in-cheek dialogue lightly". <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>'s Laura Fries wrote that the series had potential if it adhered to its own rules and focused on real drama. Fries highlighted <a href="Michael%20Katleman">Michael Katleman</a>'s directing as "crisp" and praised the show's technical credits.

"Mercy Point" also garnered negative reactions from <a href="Television%20criticism">television critics</a>, with <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s Dave Golder including it on his list of the worst science fiction and fantasy television shows of all time for its "[t]rite, obvious and cheesy" storylines. <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">"The Los Angeles Times"</a>' Howard Rosenberg criticized the show's reliance on its science-fiction context and technology to distract the viewers from "its mustiness and lack of originality". Even though Rosenberg felt the show's concept had potential and found Batung to an intriguing character, he advised the audience to "change this bedpan fast". Lee Sandlin of "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">The Chicago Reader</a>" included "Mercy Point" in his assessment of the worst television shows in the 1998–1999 season, criticizing its lack of originality and poor writing. The series was heavily panned by Kevin Wagner of the science-fiction <a href="online%20magazine">online magazine</a> "The Sci-Fi Guys", who found the pilot's story arc to be uninteresting and the use of rubber gloves as a way for <a href="Infection%23Prevention">advanced containment</a> to be unrealistic."<a href="Sun-Sentinel">The Sun-Sentinel</a>"s Hal Boedeker cited "Mercy Point" and "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer" as "misbegotten fare" that alienated its audience and lowered viewership by forty percent.

Several media commentators made negative comparisons between "Mercy Point" and other television programs. The show was described as reminiscent of a "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" skit "that sounded brighter on paper than it plays on the air" by "The Sun-Sentinel"s Tom Jicha, who felt it served as a spoof of "ER." Caryn James of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "Mercy Point" was the "oddball new series", saying it was not compelling either in a dramatic or campy manner. Editor <a href="Jason%20Snell">Jason Snell</a> criticized the show as a retread of "<a href="Crisis%20Center">Crisis Center</a>" and "<a href="General%20Hospital">General Hospital</a>", describing it as an "utter waste of an intriguing premise", and <a href="Chicago%20Tribune">"The Chicago Tribune"</a>'s Steve Johnson called it the ""ER"-in-space mess". Both Snell and Johnson encouraged UPN to cancel the series following the announcement of its hiatus.

Battle of Caishi

The Battle of Caishi (Battle of Ts'ai-shih; ) was a major naval engagement of the <a href="Jin%E2%80%93Song%20Wars">Jin–Song Wars</a> of China that took place on November 26–27, 1161. Soldiers under the command of <a href="Wanyan%20Liang">Wanyan Liang</a>, the <a href="Jurchen%20people">Jurchen</a> emperor of the <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29">Jin dynasty</a>, tried to cross the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> to attack <a href="Southern%20Song%20dynasty">Song China</a>. <a href="Yu%20Yunwen">Yu Yunwen</a>, a <a href="scholar-official">civil official</a>, commanded the defending <a href="Song%20dynasty%23Military%20and%20methods%20of%20warfare">Song army</a>. The <a href="paddle%20wheel">paddle-wheel</a> warships of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty%23China%27s%20first%20standing%20navy">Song fleet</a>, equipped with <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a>s that launched <a href="incendiary%20bomb">incendiary bomb</a>s made of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, decisively defeated the light ships of the Jin navy.

Starting in 1125 the Jin had conquered all Song territories north of the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a>. In 1142, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shaoxing">a peace treaty</a> settled the border between the two states, putting the Jin in control of northern China and the Song in control of the south. Wanyan Liang was enthroned in 1150, and was intent on uniting northern and southern China under a single emperor. In 1158, he asserted that the Song had violated the 1142 treaty, a <a href="casus%20belli">pretext for declaring war</a> on the Song. He began preparations for the war in the following year. He instituted a <a href="conscription">draft</a> in which all able-bodied men were required to enlist. The draft was unpopular, precipitating revolts that were later suppressed. The Jin army left the capital of <a href="Kaifeng">Kaifeng</a> on October 15, 1161, and pushed through from the Huai to the Yangtze River without much resistance from the Song.

The Song were fortified along the Yangtze front. Wanyan Liang planned to cross the river at Caishi, south of modern-day <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. He embarked from the shore of the Yangtze on November 26, and clashed with Song forces led by Yu Yunwen in a naval engagement. Wanyan Liang lost the battle and retreated to Yangzhou. Wanyan Liang was assassinated in a military camp by his own men shortly after the Caishi battle. A military coup had taken place in the Jin court while Wanyan Liang was absent, enthroning <a href="Emperor%20Shizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Shizong</a> as the new emperor. A peace treaty signed in 1165 ended the conflict between Song and Jin.

Song sources likely inflated the number of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern studies suggest that the battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.

The <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song</a> (960–1276) were a Chinese dynasty. To their north were the <a href="Jurchen%20people">Jurchens</a>, a confederation of semi-agrarian tribes from <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> in northeast Asia. While the Song and Jurchen had once been military allies, the Jurchen tribes, unified under the rule of <a href="Emperor%20Taizu%20of%20Jin">Wanyan Aguda</a>, plotted a revolt in 1114 to end their vassalage under the <a href="Khitan%20people">Khitan</a>-led <a href="Liao%20dynasty">Liao dynasty</a>. Aguda established the Jin dynasty in 1115 and adopted the <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">title of emperor</a>. The Jin negotiated a joint attack with the Song against the Khitans. They planned the attack for 1121 and then rescheduled to 1122. In 1122, the Jurchens captured the Liao Supreme and Western Capitals. The Song tried yet failed to capture the <a href="Nanjing%20%28Liao%20dynasty%29">Liao Southern Capital of Yan</a> (modern <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>), which fell later that year to the Jin. The military weakness of the Song gave the Jin more diplomatic leverage over them. Negotiations between the Song and Jin produced a treaty in 1123, but bilateral relations deteriorated because of territorial disputes over the <a href="Sixteen%20Prefectures">Sixteen Prefectures</a>. In 1125, the Jurchens invaded the Song.

By 1127, Jin had conquered most of northern China and besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, <a href="Emperor%20Qinzong%20of%20Song">Emperor Qinzong</a> of the Song was captured. The Jurchens took him and the Song royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of the Song court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in the Song southern capital (modern <a href="Shangqiu">Shangqiu</a>), and then in <a href="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a> in 1129. The move of the Song capital south to Hangzhou signals the transition from the Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is <a href="temple%20name">known posthumously</a> as <a href="Emperor%20Gaozong%20of%20Song">Emperor Gaozong</a>. The Jurchen general <a href="Wuzhu">Wuzhu</a> crossed the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangtze, where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by <a href="Han%20Shizhong">Han Shizhong</a>.

The Jin persisted with their advance into the remaining Song territories south of the Yangtze. They faced an insurgency of Song loyalists in the north, the deaths of some important leaders, and military offensives by Song generals like <a href="Yue%20Fei">Yue Fei</a>. The Jurchens created the puppet government of <a href="Da%20Qi">Da Qi</a> to serve as a buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up on conquering the Southern Song, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shaoxing">Treaty of Shaoxing</a> established the boundary between the two states along the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a>, which runs north of the Yangtze. The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets. The relations between the two states were mostly peaceful from 1142 to 1161, the year Wanyan Liang went to war.

Wanyan Liang was crowned Jin emperor in 1150 after killing his cousin and predecessor, <a href="Emperor%20Xizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Xizong</a>, in a palace <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a>. Wanyan Liang considered himself more of a Chinese authoritarian ruler than a Jurchen leader who ruled through a tribal council. The "<a href="History%20of%20Jin">History of Jin</a>" contends that Wanyan Liang told his officials that the three desires of his life were conquest, absolute power, and women. His ultimate ambition was to rule over all of China, not just the north. In his childhood, Wanyan Liang adopted Song practices like drinking tea by learning from Song emissaries, and once he had become emperor, he pursued a policy of <a href="Sinicization">sinicizing</a> the state. His affinity for the culture of the Song earned him the Jurchen nickname of "aping the Chinese". He moved the Supreme Capital of the Jin from <a href="Huining%20Prefecture">Huining</a> in Manchuria to Beijing and promoted Kaifeng to his Southern Capital in 1157. He also moved government institutions south, tore down palaces of Jurchen chieftains in Manchuria, and constructed new palaces in Beijing and Kaifeng. He made plans to move the Jin capital further south to the center of China. Wanyan Liang's construction projects drained the Jin treasury.

Plans for a war against the Southern Song began in 1158. That year, Wanyan Liang claimed that the Song had broken the 1142 treaty that banned them from acquiring horses. In 1159, he began building up his army in preparation for an invasion. He acquired weapons, which he stored in Beijing, as well as horses allegedly numbering 560,000. Wanyan Liang understood that an invasion of the Song would require a lot of men. He ensured that Han Chinese soldiers were <a href="conscription">drafted</a> into the war effort alongside Jurchen soldiers. The recruitment drive lasted until 1161. Naval confrontations were likely because the Jin planned on traveling by river. Ships were seized for the war and 30,000 of the recruits were assigned to the Jin fleet. Wanyan Liang authorized the building of ships for the war in March 1159, under the auspices of the Ministry of War. Construction began in the Tong () prefecture near Beijing. Wanyan Liang appointed himself head of the army and took personal command of the Jurchen forces. The draft was unpopular. Several revolts erupted against it, many of them in the Jin provinces neighboring the Song. But Wanyan Liang allowed no dissent. He had his stepmother executed after hearing that she was critical of the war effort.

In order to eliminate any challenge to his legitimacy as emperor of a united China, Wanyan Liang ordered the execution of all male members of the Song and Liao royal families residing in Jin territory. The execution of 130 members of the two royal clans in the span of a few months proved unpopular, and the Khitans soon revolted in Manchuria. They refused to be drafted into the army, maintaining that conscription would leave the homeland of the Khitans unprotected from rival tribes on the steppes. Wanyan Liang rebuffed their demands. The Khitan rebels killed several Jurchen officials. The rebellion was fragmented, and there were separate plans either to spread the revolt further by operating from <a href="Bairin%20Left%20Banner">Shangjing</a>, the former Liao capital, or to move the Khitan people from Manchuria to Central Asia, where the <a href="Kara-Khitan%20Khanate">Kara-Khitan Khanate</a> had formed after the demise of Liao. Wanyan Liang was forced to divert resources and men away from the war effort to suppress the rebellion.

Diplomatic exchanges between the Song and Jin did not stop during the period preceding the war. The "<a href="History%20of%20Song">History of Song</a>" claims that the Song realized that the Jin were planning for an invasion when they noticed the discourtesy of one of the Jin diplomats. Some Song officials foresaw the impending war, but Emperor Gaozong hoped to maintain peaceful relations with the Song's northern neighbor. His reluctance to antagonize the Jin delayed the fortification of the Song border defenses. The Song quickly built just three military garrisons in 1161. Wanyan Liang departed from Kaifeng on October 15, 1161. The offensive comprised four armies, and Wanyan Liang personally led the army that entered Anhui. The Jin passed the Huai River boundary on October 28, advancing into Song territory. The Song resistance was minimal because they had fortified the southern shore of the Yangtze River and not the Huai.

Wanyan Liang's army built its encampment near <a href="Yangzhou">Yangzhou</a> on the northern side of the Yangtze River. The Jin advance had been slowed by Song victories in the west, where the Song captured several prefectures from the Jin. Wanyan Liang commanded his forces to cross the Yangtze at Caishi, south of modern <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. A naval battle between Jin and Song took place on November 26 and 27, 1161. The Song troops were led by Yu Yunwen – a <a href="scholar-official">scholar-official</a> – and his lieutenants Dai Gao, Jian Kang, Shi Zhun, and others. Yu, who was a Drafting Official of the Secretariat ("zhongshu sheren" ), was at Caishi to distribute awards to Song soldiers who had been selected for their outstanding service; it was by chance that his visit coincided with Wanyan Liang's campaign. When he first arrived, the Song forces at Caishi were scattered and lacked a central leader. Yu took command and built a cohesive army. The Jin performed a ritual <a href="animal%20sacrifice">sacrifice of horses</a> a day before the battle. On November 26, Jin troops embarked from the shore of the Yangtze and engaged the Song fleet. Some of the ships they boarded were shoddily built. The Jin had lost several ships in <a href="Liangshan%20County">Liangshan</a>, where they were bogged down by the shallow depths of Liangshan Lake as they were being transported to the <a href="Grand%20Canal%20%28China%29">Grand Canal</a>. Wanyan Liang had urgently requested the construction of more ships in 1161 to compensate for those still stuck in Liangshan. One account of the war contends that the Jin ships were constructed in a week with materials recycled from destroyed buildings. The shortage of vessels and the poor quality of those available prevented the Jin from ferrying more soldiers needed for fighting a naval battle with the Song.

The Song military response was likely stronger than Wanyan Liang had anticipated. The paddle-wheel ships of the Song navy could move more rapidly and outmaneuver the slower Jin ships. The Song kept their fleet hidden behind the island of Qibao Shan. The ships were to depart the island once a scout on horseback announced the approach of the Jin ships by signalling a concealed flag atop the island's peak. Once the flag became visible, the Song fleet commenced their attack from both sides of the island. Song soldiers operated <a href="trebuchet">traction trebuchets</a> that launched incendiary "thunderclap bombs" and other soft-cased explosives containing <a href="lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a> and sulphur, which created a noxious explosion when the casing broke. The Jin soldiers who managed to cross the river and reach the shore were assaulted by Song troops waiting on the other side. The Song won a decisive victory. Wanyan Liang was defeated again in a second engagement the next day. After burning his remaining ships, he retreated to Yangzhou, where he was assassinated before he could finish preparations for another crossing.

Estimates for the number of soldiers and casualties at the battle vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song soldiers stationed in Caishi, a number that historian <a href="Herbert%20Franke%20%28sinologist%29">Herbert Franke</a> considers plausible. However, Song estimates for the number of Jin troops are likely inflated. One document claims that 400,000 Jin soldiers were present at the battle. This number is doubtful, bearing in mind that the Song had only 120,000 soldiers fighting on the entire front. Song historians may have confused the total number of Jin personnel deployed on the front with the number of Jin combatants at Caishi. The inflated figure could have referred to the number of soldiers that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangtze. The "History of Jin", a document written from the perspective of the Jin, reports Jin casualties between one "meng'an" (a Jurchen unit of a thousand soldiers) and a hundred men, and two "meng'an" and two hundred men. The "History of Song" reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand soldiers and two commanders of "wanhu" (ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin soldiers died and that 500 combatants and five "meng-an" were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 soldiers and 20 ships at Caishi. It is not certain which of these figures is more accurate; Franke believes that the safest conclusion that can be drawn is that the number of Jin casualties was not greater than four thousand.

An account of the Song's technological capabilities is given in the "Hai Qiu Fu" ("Rhapsodic Ode on the Sea-eel Paddle Wheel Warships"):

The men inside them paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided forwards as though they were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and <a href="sulphur">sulphur</a>. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.
There were up to 340 ships in the Song fleet during the battle of Caishi in 1161. The Song fleet used trebuchets to bombard the Jin ships with incendiary bombs ("pili huoqiu" or "huopao" ; "thunderclap fire balls") that contained a mixture of gunpowder, <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>. Reports that the bomb produced a loud sound suggests that the <a href="saltpeter">nitrate</a> content of the gunpowder mixture was high enough to create an explosion. The powdered lime in the bombs at Caishi generated a cloud of blinding smoke similar to tear gas. The "huoqiu" released the smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered. <a href="Fuse%20%28explosives%29">Fuses</a> activated the bombs after launching.

The Jin conscripted thousands of blacksmiths to build the armor and weaponry of the fleet, and workers to dig out the canal necessary for transporting the ships from Tong to the Grand Canal through the northern port of Zhigu (), modern <a href="Tianjin">Tianjin</a>. The Jin armored their light ships with thick rhinoceros <a href="Hide%20%28skin%29">hides</a>. The ships had two stories; on the lower deck were the <a href="oarsmen">oarsmen</a> responsible for rowing the ship, while soldiers on the upper deck could fire missile weapons. Three different variations of the warships were constructed. Several of the ships became bogged down in Liangshan, and the ships built to replace them were of an inferior quality. The Jin fleet were unable to defeat the larger and faster warships of the Song.

The battle is significant in the technological history of the Song navy. The technological advances of the Song navy ensured its access to the East China Sea, where they competed with the military forces of Jin and Mongol rivals. Although "huopao" launched by the ship-mounted trebuchets had been invented decades earlier, the bombs did not become mandatory on Song warships until 1129. <a href="Paddle%20steamer">Paddle-wheel</a> ships operated with <a href="treadmill%23Treadmills%20for%20power">treadmills</a> were constructed continuously in various sizes between 1132 and 1183. The engineer Gao Xuan devised a ship outfitted with up to eleven paddle wheels on each side, and Qin Shifu, another engineer, designed the iron plating for armoring the ships in 1203. All these advances supported a rapid increase in the size of the force; according to the 20th-century historian <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a>, "From a total of 11 <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadrons</a> and 3,000 men [the Song navy] rose in one century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men".

Traditional Chinese historiography celebrated the battle of Caishi as an important victory for China. Caishi was held in the same esteem as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fei%20River">Battle of Fei River</a> in 383, when the <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29">Eastern Jin</a> defeated the northern invaders of the <a href="Former%20Qin">Former Qin</a>. However, its portrayal as a victory against overwhelming odds, in which 18,000 Song soldiers overcame an army of nearly half a million men, is likely an exaggeration. Modern historians believe that the number of Jin soldiers was far lower. The Song possessed multiple advantages, and the battle was more evenly matched than contemporaneous historians suggest. The Song had larger ships and ample time to prepare while the Jin army gathered supplies and ships for the crossing. It was also impossible for the Jin to use cavalry, the most important asset of the Jurchen military, during a naval engagement.

A modern analysis of the background of the conflict and the battlefield has also shown that it was a smaller engagement than traditionally believed. Its effects were more psychological than material. The battle was not solely responsible for dooming Wanyan Liang's military campaign; his own failings also led to his downfall. Wanyan Liang's generals detested him, and his relationship with his men had deteriorated over the course of the war. His authoritarianism made him equally unpopular among his own people. There was a widespread disapproval of his reign in the empire, and Wanyan Liang's policies had alienated the Jurchens, the Khitans, and the Han Chinese. Disaffected officers conspired to kill him, and he was assassinated on December 15, 1161. <a href="Emperor%20Shizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Shizong</a> succeeded Wanyan Liang as ruler of the Jin. He had been enthroned weeks before the assassination, in a military coup that installed him as emperor while Wanyan Liang was absent from the court. Shizong eventually rescinded many of Wanyan Liang's sinification policies.

The victory boosted the morale of the Song soldiers and increased dissatisfaction among the Jin army. News of the victory improved confidence in the government and bolstered the stability of the Song. The Jurchens gave up their ambitions of conquering the Southern Song and reunifying China. The Jin army withdrew in 1162, and diplomatic relations between the two states resumed. Emperor Gaozong retired nine months after the conclusion of the battle. The reasons for his abdication are complicated, but Gaozong's handling of the war with Wanyan Liang may have had a part in his decision to resign. He had ignored the warnings of a Jin attack and his hopes for conciliation held back plans for strengthening the Song defenses.

Military clashes continued in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent of reaching the Yangtze. The Jin had discovered that southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. They signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same and the Song continued to pay annual indemnities to the Jin, but the Song no longer recognized their state as a Jin vassal.

House with Chimaeras

House with Chimaeras or Horodecki House (, ) is an <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> building located in the <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20Kyiv%23Historical%20neighborhoods">historic</a> <a href="Lypky">Lypky</a> neighborhood of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, the capital of Ukraine. Situated across the street from the <a href="President%20of%20Ukraine">President of Ukraine</a>'s office at No. 10, <a href="Bankova%20Street">Bankova Street</a>, the building has been used as a presidential residence for official and diplomatic ceremonies since 2005. The street in front of the building is closed off to all automobile traffic, and is now a patrolled <a href="pedestrian%20zone">pedestrian zone</a> due to its near proximity to the <a href="Presidential%20Administration%20of%20Ukraine">Presidential Administration building</a>.

The Polish architect <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Horodecki">Władysław Horodecki</a> originally constructed the House with Chimaeras for use as his own upmarket apartment building during the period of 1901–1902. However, as the years went by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official <a href="Communist%20Party%20%28Bolshevik%29%20of%20Ukraine">Communist Party</a> <a href="polyclinic">polyclinic</a> until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.

The building derives its popular name from the ornate decorations depicting exotic animals and hunting scenes, which were sculpted by <a href="Italy">Italian</a> architect <a href="Emilio%20Sala%20%28sculptor%29">Emilio Sala</a> since Horodecki was an avid hunter. The name does not refer to the <a href="Chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimaera</a> of mythology, but to an architectural style known as <a href="chimera%20%28architecture%29">chimaera</a> decoration in which animal figures are applied as decorative elements to a building. Horodecki unique architectural style earned him praise as the <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a> of Kiev.

A House with Chimaeras was designed by the Polish architect <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Horodecki">Władysław Horodecki</a> in 1901–1902. Horodecki was born in 1863 into a prosperous <a href="Poles">Polish</a> <a href="szlachta">szlachta</a> family in the <a href="Podolia">Podillia</a> region. After finishing the <a href="Imperial%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Imperial Academy of Arts</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in 1890, he moved to Kiev, where he lived for almost 30 years. At the time of the building's construction, Horodecki had already established himself as a prominent Kiev architect, having designed and constructed together with his close friend and partner engineer <a href="Anton%20Strauss">Anton Strauss</a> many city buildings, from the <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Roman%20Catholic%20Cathedral%2C%20Kyiv">St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral</a> to the <a href="Karaim%20Kenesa%20%28Kyiv%29">Karaim Kenesa</a> and what today is the <a href="National%20Art%20Museum%20of%20Ukraine">National Art Museum of Ukraine</a>. Besides architecture, Horodecki was also interested in <a href="big-game%20hunter">big-game hunting</a>, which explains why his building features many animals.

Horodecki financed the house's construction with borrowed money, with the intent for it to be an <a href="apartment%20building">apartment building</a>. Each floor formed a single apartment, connected by an <a href="elevator">elevator</a> and stairs. Horodecki himself occupied the fourth floor of the building, measuring at about .

Horodecki bought the first lot of land on February 1, 1901, with construction work commencing on March 18 of that year. Construction of the exterior walls was finished by August 21, and the roof installed and all <a href="masonry">masonry</a> work was completed on September 13. Due to the economic hardships within the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the completion of the building was delayed. In May 1903, only one apartment on the lowest level and Horodecki's own apartment were occupied. The total cost of the land and construction amounted to 133,000 <a href="Russian%20ruble%23First%20ruble%2C%20Antiquity%20-%20December%2031%2C%201921">rubles</a>. In total, of land were used for construction of the building and cost a total of 15,640 rubles. The projected annual profit from the rentals was 7,200 rubles. A cowshed was located on the premises due to Horodecki's insistence on fresh in-house milk, though it was specifically placed in a way that the smell of the cows would not disturb the tenants. On a lot adjacent to the building, a miniature <a href="rock%20garden">alpine garden</a> (approx. ) and a fountain were built.

Due to financial mismanagement which included his <a href="Safari">Safari</a> hunting hobby, in July 1912, Horodecki pledged the building as a collateral against a loan taken from Kyiv Mutual Credit Association. When Horodecki defaulted on the loan, the building was auctioned off in 1913, and became the property of the engineer Daniel Balakhovsky, the son of a Kiev trader, who was also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Blahodatinskoe sugar factory, and a <a href="France">French</a> сonsular agent in Kiev. In 1916, the house belonged to the Blahodatinskoe sugar factory. In 1918, the building's ownership changed again, to Samuel Nemets. In 1921, after the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s gained control of Kiev, several of the departments of the Kiev Military District took offices in the House with Chimaeras.

After the <a href="Ukraine%20after%20the%20Russian%20Revolution">period of unrest</a> following the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, the building was <a href="Nationalization">nationalized</a> and later converted for <a href="Kommunalka">communal living</a>. Each apartment was occupied by about nine to ten families. During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> (1941–1943), the building was abandoned. Due to exposure to the harsh elements during the war, the building suffered significant damage to its structure. After the war, the building was briefly used as a residence for evacuated actors from the <a href="Ivan%20Franko">Ivan Franko</a> Theater; however, the Central Committee of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20%28Bolshevik%29%20of%20Ukraine">Communist Party</a> of the <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> took ownership of the building and later transformed it into the Polyclinic ("<a href="clinic">clinic</a>") No. 1 for their elite. The polyclinic used the building up until the end of the 20th century. During that time, the building almost split in half. One part sagged , and a major vertical crack formed, having a width of about . Some of the building's architectural details had either been chipped away, or had cracked.

The building's restoration work was scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded up all of the windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the <a href="Leonid%20Kuchma">president</a>'s involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.

During the time of the restoration, conducted by "UkrNIIProektRestavratsiya" and headed by Natalia Kosenko, the workers unearthed the whole lower floor, which had been filled in during <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> times to strengthen the building's foundation. Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Horodecki's original plans.

The building was opened as a filial "Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art" of the National Museum of Arts in November 2004. It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors. In April 2005, the <a href="Kiev%20City%20Council">Kiev City Council</a> submitted a bill for 104 million <a href="Ukrainian%20hryvnia">hryvnias</a> (approx. <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US $</a>20 million) to the <a href="Government%20of%20Ukraine">Ukrainian Government</a> for reconstruction and restoration of the House with Chimaeras. The Council also allowed the Ukrainian government to construct a new square (closing off all automobile traffic) in front of the building for use in official ceremonies.

Since May 2005, the building has been an official <a href="President%20of%20Ukraine">presidential</a> residence, used for official and diplomatic ceremonies. The House with Chimaeras was used as a meeting place between Ukrainian President <a href="Viktor%20Yushchenko">Viktor Yushchenko</a> and <a href="President%20of%20Russia">Russian President</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, when the latter visited Kiev on December 22, 2006. Included in the building are rooms for negotiations, <a href="wikt%3At%C3%AAte-%C3%A0-t%C3%AAte">tête-à-tête</a> talks, the signing of official documents, as well as a special room for the press.

The building was designed in the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style, which was at that time a relatively new style and featured flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Horodecki featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Gaudí</a> of Kiev.

Due to the steep slope on which the building is situated, it had to be specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.

The Italian sculptor <a href="Emilio%20Sala%20%28sculptor%29">Emilio Sala</a> was responsible for both the internal and external sculptural decorations, such as <a href="mermaid">mermaid</a>s, dolphins, and frogs on the roof of the building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>s depicting huge <a href="catfish">catfish</a> strangled in the stems of <a href="Nymphaea">lotus</a> flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of <a href="cement">cement</a>. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the building material.

The House with Chimaeras was designed in such a way that the tenants would occupy the whole floor, each floor had all the necessary household rooms ranging from private kitchens to small powder rooms. The open floor plan and extra rooms featured throughout the building are characteristic of the houses of the wealthy of the early 20th century. In total, the building has an area of .

On the lowest level of the building, which is located deep in the hill, were two <a href="stable">stable</a>s, two rooms for <a href="coachman">coachmen</a>, a shared laundry, and two separate apartments. Each of the two apartments consisted of a foyer, a kitchen, one bathroom, and a storage room. The first of these apartments had two residential rooms, and the second three rooms. Each floor above the lowest level was designed to house a single apartment only.

The apartment on the second floor consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, <a href="buffet">buffet</a>, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. There were also four <a href="wine%20cellar">wine cellar</a>s on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, <a href="Scullery%20%28room%29">dish washing room</a>, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of <a href="Bankova%20Street">Bankova Street</a>, from the front entrance.

The grandest apartment, which belonged to Horodecki, consisted of a <a href="study%20%28room%29">study</a>, a <a href="great%20room">great room</a> and a <a href="living%20room">living room</a>, a <a href="dining%20room">dining room</a>, a boudoir, a <a href="bedroom">bedroom</a>, a children's room, a room for a <a href="governess">governess</a>, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The apartment on the top floor had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city.

Throughout the years, the unusual nature of the House with Chimaeras has given rise to a number of stories occasionally repeated in guide-books or newspapers, which are however either untrue or lacking any verifiable source.

According to the first legend, Władysław Horodecki's daughter had committed suicide jumping into <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper River</a> either because of some unfortunate love affair or because of a family feud. As a result, Horodecki went slightly mad and built this gloomy house in his daughter's memory.

A second legend has it that Horodecki made a bet with some other architects, including the architect Alexander Skobelev, who had tried to prove that was impossible to build a house on such terrain, because the site (near the <a href="Ivan%20Franko">Ivan Franko</a> Theater) overhangs a swamp ("Koz'ye boloto"). The Construction Committee of Kiev had prohibited construction of any structures on this particular lot, but eventually the construction of the building allowed Horodecki to win the bet.

According to the third legend, Horodecki had cursed it in 1913 (due to his <a href="foreclosure">inability to repay his creditors</a>); all of the house's tenants would be either unhappy or would meet some sort of financial misfortune. There is a story that all the businesses who rented a portion of the building either went <a href="bankrupt">bankrupt</a>, had their funds stolen or were disbanded.

Tenebrae (film)

Tenebrae (, also known as Tenebre) is a 1982 Italian "<a href="giallo">giallo</a>" film written and directed by <a href="Dario%20Argento">Dario Argento</a>. The film stars <a href="Anthony%20Franciosa">Anthony Franciosa</a> as American author Peter Neal, who – while in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> promoting his latest murder-mystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by his novel. <a href="John%20Saxon">John Saxon</a> and <a href="Daria%20Nicolodi">Daria Nicolodi</a> co-star as Neal's agent and assistant, while <a href="Giuliano%20Gemma">Giuliano Gemma</a> and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders. <a href="John%20Steiner">John Steiner</a>, <a href="Veronica%20Lario">Veronica Lario</a> and <a href="Mirella%20D%27Angelo">Mirella D'Angelo</a> also feature in minor roles. The film has been described as exploring themes of <a href="dualistic%20cosmology">dualism</a> and sexual aberration, and has strong <a href="metafiction">metafiction</a>al elements; some commentators consider "Tenebrae" to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work, most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women.

After Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977's "<a href="Suspiria">Suspiria</a>" and 1980's "<a href="Inferno%20%281980%20film%29">Inferno</a>", "Tenebrae" represented the filmmaker's return to the "giallo" horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of "Tenebrae". The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted "to kill for nothing".

Shot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios, "Tenebrae" utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography <a href="Luciano%20Tovoli">Luciano Tovoli</a>, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band <a href="Goblin%20%28band%29">Goblin</a> provided "Tenebrae"s music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.

"Tenebrae" was a modest success in Italy; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes. However, in the United Kingdom, it was added to the infamous list of "<a href="video%20nasty">video nasties</a>" and banned from sale until 1999. The film's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984, when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane. In its cut form, "Tenebrae" received a mostly negative critical reception, but the original, fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal; it is considered by some to be one of Argento's best thrillers. The film critic and author <a href="Maitland%20McDonagh">Maitland McDonagh</a> has said that it is "in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made".

Peter Neal, an <a href="United%20States">American</a> writer of violent horror novels, visits Italy to promote his latest work, "Tenebrae". He is joined in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> by his assistant Anne, and his literary agent Bullmer. Unbeknownst to Neal, his embittered fiancée Jane has vandalized his suitcase in <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">JFK</a> and followed him to Rome. Hours before Neal's arrival, young shoplifter Elsa is killed with a razor by an unseen assailant. Detective Giermani and Inspector Altieri question Neal because Elsa's mouth had been stuffed with pages of "Tenebrae". Neal receives an anonymous letter, deemed by Giermani a prelude to an impending killing spree. 

The film is punctuated hereafter by visions tormenting an unseen man. Implied to be flashbacks, they showcase a young woman flirting with several male youths in a beach. One of them slaps her and is then chased and held down by the others while she kicks and orally <a href="rapes">rapes</a> him with red <a href="High-heeled%20shoe">high-heeled shoes</a>. Later, unequivocally <a href="Point-of-view%20shot">POV shot</a> flashbacks show him stabbing her to death in revenge. 

More killings and letters ensue in the present, confirming Giermani's prediction. Lesbian journalist and Neal acquaintance Tilde is murdered at her home, along with her lover Marion. Maria, the daughter of Neal's landlord, is axed to death after stumbling into the killer's lair. TV book reviewer Christiano Berti shows an intense fixation on Neal's work, as well as a bigoted prudishness much like that of the killer's letters. Following this hunch, and the fact that Maria's body was found in <a href="EUR%2C%20Rome">Berti's district</a>, Neal and his assistant Gianni spy on Berti, who is burning pictures and files identifying him as the killer. Gianni sees Berti telling someone "I killed them all!" and having his head split by an axe, but is unable to see the murderer. He finds Neal knocked unconscious on the lawn and they flee the scene. 

Neal has sex with Anne that night, a first in their six-year acquaintance. After Neal leaves Bullmer's office the next morning, his fiancée Jane comes out of an adjacent room and is revealed to be Bullmer's lover. Giermani calls Neal to the Berti crime scene after finding dossiers proving Berti's obsession with him, but is unaware of the burnt evidence. He thus believes the killer is still at large, and is comforted by Neal's intention to leave Rome. Jane receives a gift of red shoes like those prevalent in the seaside flashbacks. Bullmer is stabbed to death in a public square while waiting for Jane, who witnesses the aftermath and flees. Neal's plane leaves for Paris that evening. 

Meanwhile, Gianni is haunted by the significance of what he witnessed in Berti's house. He returns there and realizes that Berti's self-incriminating last words imply "two" murderers. Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone, he is garrotted to death in his car. A distraught Jane calls Anne to her place, and waits in her kitchen holding a pistol. An axe shatters the window and hacks off her forearm. Blood sprays over the walls and Jane falls to the floor, where several blows finish her off. Inspector Altieri enters and is also killed, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards. Held at gunpoint by Giermani, Neal tacitly confesses to killing Berti and everyone after him, then slits his throat. 

Giermani reports the incident from the car radio and comforts Anne. A final explanation takes form. The teenage murder flashbacks were Neal's. Berti's sadistic murder spree had unlocked a repressed memory in Neal, namely his murder of the girl who had humiliated him as a youth in <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. The memory inflamed Neal's previously suppressed bloodlust, driving him insane. It also fueled his plan to eliminate Jane and Bullmer, whose affair he knew of, by maintaining a semblance that the original killer had murdered Berti and was still active. Whether Berti destroyed his murder files at Neal's secret behest, or spontaneously, is left to speculation.

Giermani returns inside and is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits for Anne to return; when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.

According to the film historian and critic <a href="Bill%20Warren%20%28film%20historian%20and%20critic%29">Bill Warren</a>, "Tenebrae" is a typical example of the "giallo" film genre: "visually extremely stylish, with imaginative, sometimes stunning cinematography", it presents "mysterious, gruesome murders, often in picturesque locations; at the end, the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to terrify and surprise." These narrative and visual strategies had been introduced years before Argento made his first thriller, 1970's "<a href="The%20Bird%20with%20the%20Crystal%20Plumage">The Bird with the Crystal Plumage</a>"—most critics point to <a href="Mario%20Bava">Mario Bava</a>'s "<a href="La%20ragazza%20che%20sapeva%20troppo">The Girl Who Knew Too Much</a>" (1963) as the original "giallo".

By the time Argento made "Tenebrae", he had become the acknowledged master of the genre, to the point where he felt confident enough to be openly self-referential to his own past, referencing the "reckless driving humor" from "<a href="The%20Cat%20o%27%20Nine%20Tails">The Cat o' Nine Tails</a>" (1971) and the hero from "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage". The scene in which <a href="Veronica%20Lario">Veronica Lario</a>'s character, Jane, returns home directly references "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage" with its large sculpture in the entrance hallway.

Warren and Alan Jones cite a scene where a character is killed in a public square as evoking the work of <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>. The film critic and author <a href="Maitland%20McDonagh">Maitland McDonagh</a> argues that Argento's influences for "Tenebrae" were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film as an example of "the most paranoid excesses of "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>"." McDonagh suggests that <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s "<a href="Beyond%20a%20Reasonable%20Doubt%20%281956%20film%29">Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</a>" (1956) ("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence ... is in fact guilty of the murder") and <a href="Roy%20William%20Neill">Roy William Neill</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Angel">Black Angel</a>" (1946) ("in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer") both use such a similar plot twist to "Tenebrae" that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.

Kim Newman and Alan Jones suggest that the mysteries of <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href="Rex%20Stout">Rex Stout</a> and <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a> were all obvious influences on "Tenebrae", and there are many references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> in Conan Doyle's novel "<a href="The%20Sign%20of%20the%20Four">The Sign of Four</a>" (1890): "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" A variation of this quote is delivered many times in "Tenebrae". Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a <a href="Non%20sequitur%20%28literary%20device%29">non sequitur</a>, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's "<a href="The%20Hound%20of%20the%20Baskervilles">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>" (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film "<a href="Suddenly%2C%20Last%20Summer%20%28film%29">Suddenly, Last Summer</a>" (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> in that film.

Critics have identified various major <a href="Theme%20%28literature%29">themes</a> in "Tenebrae". In interviews conducted during the film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in "Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento", "... Argento has never been more articulate and/or analytical than he was on the subject of "Tenebrae"." Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters "lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored". According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with "Tenebrae" Argento "explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, voyeurism, audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death." Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water. Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.

According to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, "Tenebrae" is filled with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's exploration of "the dual nature of [the] two active murderers" using doubles, inversions, reflections and "re-reflections". Every major character has at least one double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions and events – major and minor. The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths, aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves. Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri. McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: "Giermani ... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator ... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away." McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani "go away", virtually replacing him on screen "in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous." Earlier, Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience's surprise – was not Anne, but Altieri. "Tenebrae" itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with "lingering sexualized aggressiveness", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift and to the point.

Kevin Lyon observes, "The plot revolves around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." While noting that the device is "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely "warped" individuals. She suggests that "Neal and Berti ... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, "It was like a book ... a book!"

The moment in which the first half of the movie transitions into the second is punctuated by the rising score and <a href="camera%20pan">camera pan</a> to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins. Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, "clichéd and remote" "giallo". Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with "weight and meaning". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot. According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: "art that kills people". Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.

According to Gracey, a number of critics have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director. Gracey refers to "Tenebrae" as a "reflexive commentary on [the director's] earlier work." The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that "[he] was a misogynist ... a criminal ... a murderer." Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into "Tenebrae". A scene in which a woman criticizes the lead character's books as "sexist", featuring "women as victims, cipers, male heroes [and] macho bullshit" echoes criticisms of Argento's own work. Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene "essentially autobiographical", and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to "let it speak". With "Tenebrae" in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself. Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception. Newman agrees that Argento used "Tenebrae" to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as "sick and twisted" as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With "Tenebrae"s reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, "What if I were?"

As in many of Argento's films, which tend to eroticize the murder of beautiful women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being "about human perversion and its effects on society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His "moral crusade" is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth." McDonagh also notes that "Tenebrae" expands on the themes of sexuality and <a href="transvestitism">transvestitism</a> found in Argento's earlier films, "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage", "The Cat o' Nine Tails", "<a href="Four%20Flies%20on%20Grey%20Velvet">Four Flies on Grey Velvet</a>" (1972), and "<a href="Deep%20Red">Deep Red</a>" (1975), but believes that "Tenebrae"s "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other "gialli"." She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that ""Tenebrae" is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature." Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's "preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle".

McDonagh noted that two sexually charged flashbacks are key to understanding "Tenebrae". These distinct but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the film, usually immediately following a murder sequence. Although the flashbacks are never fully explained, the first reveals a beautiful young woman's sexual humiliation (though oral rape) of a teenage boy, presumed to be Peter Neal. The young woman is mostly topless during this first sequence, and she humiliates the young man by jamming the heel of one of her shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held down by a group of gleeful boys on a pale-white beach. The second flashback shows the vicious revenge-murder of the woman some time later. McDonagh notes that all of the <a href="Fetishism">fetishistic</a> imagery of these flashbacks, combined with the sadistic details of the murder sequences in the main narrative, "set the parameters of "Tenebrae"s fetishistic and fetishicized visual vocabulary, couched in terms both ritualistic and orgiastically out of control ... Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and "Tenebrae" revels in them, inviting the spectator to join in; in fact, it dares the viewer not to do so."

The protagonists in Argento's "giallo" films almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind. It is these characters' chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (<a href="Karl%20Malden">Karl Malden</a>) in "The Cat o' Nine Tails", who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his niece to solve a mystery. In "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage", Sam Dalmas (<a href="Tony%20Musante">Tony Musante</a>) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not "miss" anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In "Deep Red", Marcus (<a href="David%20Hemmings">David Hemmings</a>) has a similar problem in both seeing and "not" seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to <a href="Douglas%20E.%20Winter">Douglas E. Winter</a>, creates "a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing".

Flanagan observes that in "Tenebrae", Argento offers two characters who suffer from impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning to the scene of the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>, <a href="Mickey%20Spillane">Mickey Spillane</a>, <a href="Rex%20Stout">Rex Stout</a>, and <a href="Ed%20McBain">Ed McBain</a>, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.

In an interview that appeared in "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>", Argento noted that the film was intended as near-<a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, taking place "about five or more years in the future ... "Tenebrae" occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember ... It isn't exactly my "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>", of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an <a href="nuclear%20weapon">atomic bomb</a> blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept "isn't apparent at all" and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a <a href="videophone">videophone</a> as an attempt by Argento to place "Tenebrae" in the near future.

While rejecting this thematic concern as unrealized by Argento, McDonagh noted that the result of the director's experiment is a strange "architectural landscape" that becomes the "key element in differentiating "Tenebrae" from Argento's earlier "gialli"." Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual "hyper-realism" results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, "... I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." The <a href="EUR%2C%20Rome">EUR</a> district of Rome, where much of "Tenebrae" was filmed, was built in preparation for the <a href="Esposizione%20universale%20%281942%29">1942 World's Fair</a>, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> to be a celebration of twenty years of <a href="fascism">fascism</a>. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.

After completing "<a href="Inferno%20%281980%20film%29">Inferno</a>" (1980), the second in his planned "<a href="The%20Three%20Mothers">Three Mothers</a>" trilogy of supernatural horror films, Argento was expected to move straight into production of its concluding chapter. The first in the trilogy, "<a href="Suspiria">Suspiria</a>" (1977), had turned the director into what Alan Jones called "a horror superstar", but "Inferno" had proven a difficult follow-up. Argento had become unwell while writing the film, and his ill health continued into filming. In addition, Argento's relationship with "Inferno"s co-producer <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> had soured the director on "Hollywood politics", so when "Inferno" was not well-received upon release, Argento put the "Three Mothers" trilogy on hold. "Inferno" also flopped commercially. According to James Gracey, Argento – under pressure and feeling "the need to once again defy expectations" – returned to the "giallo" genre and began work on "Tenebrae". Argento later stated that he wanted to "put on film a gory roller-coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders" and that he "shouldn't resist what [his] hardcore audience wanted". He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last "giallo" so many other directors had made films derivative of – and inferior to – his own genre-defining works.

Argento said that "Tenebrae" was directly influenced by two distressing incidents that occurred 1980. On a break from filmmaking after "Suspiria"s surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly, to talk about "Suspiria"s influence on him. According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing. The fan claimed that he wanted "to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director's work had affected him", and that because the director had "ruined his life", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's. Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying, and felt unable to write. At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy. Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were "symptomatic of that city of broken dreams" with its "celebrity stalkers and senseless crime". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at <a href="The%20Beverly%20Hilton">The Beverly Hilton</a>, where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: "To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today ... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in "Tenebrae"."

Argento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to <a href="Christopher%20Walken">Christopher Walken</a>, but eventually it went to <a href="Anthony%20Franciosa">Anthony Franciosa</a>. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and <a href="Daria%20Nicolodi">Daria Nicolodi</a>, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of "Suspiria". Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in "Tenebrae". By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrow—which ultimately went to <a href="Veronica%20Lario">Veronica Lario</a>. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock states that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress <a href="Eva%20Robin%27s">Eva Robin's</a> was later hired to play the woman on the beach.
When the American actress who had been hired to play Anne dropped out just before the start of principal photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role. Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, who she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities. Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make sure their shared scenes "were an ordeal to endure". The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, "leave my woman alone!" Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits. She had been directed to scream only a little, but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise. Nicolodi said the scene was her "cathartic release from the whole nightmare".

Although "Tenebrae" was an Italian production, most of the cast spoke their dialogue in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by <a href="Theresa%20Russell">Theresa Russell</a>, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by <a href="David%20Graham%20%28actor%29">David Graham</a>, and most of the female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta. <a href="Michele%20Soavi">Michele Soavi</a> – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on "Tenebrae" and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, <a href="Fulvio%20Mingozzi">Fulvio Mingozzi</a> cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own. In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, "Tenebrae".

Filming began on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks shot mostly on location in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of "Tenebrae" as unlike the one usually shown on television and in films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilized so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, "Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern." Most of "Tenebrae"s location shooting was carried out in Rome's <a href="EUR%2C%20Rome">EUR</a> business and residential district. The first flashback scene was filmed at the <a href="Capocotta">Capocotta beach</a>, south of the city near <a href="Ostia%20%28Rome%29">Ostia</a>. The shoplifting scene near the beginning of "Tenebrae" was filmed on location at department store <a href="La%20Rinascente">La Rinascente</a>, off Piazza Fiume. Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called ""Le Terrazze"" in Rome's <a href="Casal%20Palocco">Casal Palocco</a> residential neighbourhood. The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti, switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer. The scene at the beginning of the film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> in New York.

Giuseppe Bassan – a frequent Argento collaborator – was the film's production designer. The surroundings are given a bleached, "merciless" look, made from marble and stone façades, shiny metallic sculptures, with steel, water and glass surfaces. Some of the homes – specifically those of the lesbian couple and the first killer – are "cold, austere, brutalist" slabs of granite, and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds, with characters' wearing pale-coloured clothes against them – better, Newman felt, to contrast the blood once the violence started. The studio-set scenes were filmed at <a href="Elios%20Studios">Elios Studios</a> in Rome, unlike Argento's previous films in the city, which he had filmed at Incir De Paolis. He was not able to use Elios, as the director <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>, of whom he was a huge fan, was using the studio to film "<a href="Identification%20of%20a%20Woman">Identification of a Woman</a>" (1982) at the time. The design and creation of "Tenebrae"s special effects were supervised by Giovanni Corridori, who – with his brother Tonino – had a near-monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time. The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times. Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had, which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the "wound" across the white wall, so the director had Corridori place an <a href="squib%20%28explosive%29">explosive squib</a> in the prosthetic arm – a solution which apparently satisfied Argento.

Much of "Tenebrae" takes place during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings. The lighting and camerawork used in <a href="Andrzej%20%C5%BBu%C5%82awski">Andrzej Żuławski</a>'s "<a href="Possession%20%281981%20film%29">Possession</a>" (1981) was an influence on the film's look. Although "tenebr(a)e" means "darkness" or "shadows" in <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>, Argento ordered cinematographer <a href="Luciano%20Tovoli">Luciano Tovoli</a> to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a "cold, stark and semi-futuristic look". Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the "realistic manner of lighting" used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting "a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a>. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes ... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring." Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city. Tovoli used <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Kodak</a> 5247 film stock (125 <a href="Film%20speed%23ASA">ASA</a> speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled <a href="Exposure%20%28photography%29">overexposure</a> of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be "crystal clear", and the night scenes to be awash with light.

Film scholar <a href="Richard%20Dyer">Richard Dyer</a> highlights several intelligent devices used by Argento in the editing of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by "shots of pills and the sound of running water." Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts in the latter part of the film are among cinema's "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of "Tenebrae" make it as much an example of <a href="art%20cinema">art cinema</a> as anything else. The initial murders are shot in a "clipped montage style", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.

 Gracey refers to the film's cinematography as "nothing short of astounding", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's "passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals". Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's "<a href="The%20Passenger%20%281975%20film%29">The Passenger</a>" (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of "Tenebrae"s main setpieces is the murder of the lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a <a href="Crane%20shot">Louma crane</a> to film a several minutes-long <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home". Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, at the time it was "truly ground-breaking" in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of "Scifilm" said the sequence should be considered "one of the most memorable moments in cinema". According to McAllister, "Tenebrae"s distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was "meaningless". Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it "meaninglessly brilliant".

Some European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby card sets, advertised the film as "Tenebre", and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title. However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, the title is clearly "Tenebrae". In addition, the title of Neal's latest book in the film is shown in closeup as being "Tenebrae". In a lengthy interview with Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of "<a href="Fangoria">Fangoria</a>" in 1983 and 1984, the title was always referred to as "Tenebrae". Early on in production, the film was referred to as "Under the Eyes of the Assassin", which was later used as one of the poster taglines. In Japan, the film was released as "Shadows", and in the United States it was titled "Unsane" in its initial – heavily edited – incarnation.

The Italian rock band <a href="Goblin%20%28band%29">Goblin</a> had provided the scores for two of Argento's previous films, "Deep Red" (1975) and "Suspiria" (1977), but the director had employed English composer <a href="Keith%20Emerson">Keith Emerson</a> for his foray outside of the "giallo" subgenre, 1980's "Inferno". Goblin had disbanded that year, but in 1982 Argento asked three of the band's former members – <a href="Claudio%20Simonetti">Claudio Simonetti</a>, <a href="Fabio%20Pignatelli">Fabio Pignatelli</a> and <a href="Massimo%20Morante">Massimo Morante</a> – to work on "Tenebrae". Owing to their history together, Simonetti felt it appropriate that Argento's return to "giallo" films should utilize the core members of Goblin. The resulting <a href="Synthesizer">synth</a>-driven score was credited to "Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante", as Goblin's former drummer owned the rights to use the band's name.

"Tenebrae"s score is very different to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for "Tenebrae". Simonetti described the score as an <a href="electronica">electronica</a>/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So it would not be difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the <a href="Roland%20Jupiter-8">Roland Jupiter-8</a>, Roland <a href="Vocoder">Vocoder</a> Plus and <a href="Minimoog">Minimoog</a> synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the <a href="Oberheim%20DMX">Oberheim DMX</a> drum machine, the <a href="Roland%20TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> drum machine, and <a href="Roland%20MC-4%20Microcomposer">Roland MC-4</a> music sequencer. Pignatelli played <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a> and <a href="Fretless%20guitar">fretless</a> guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.

While the soundtrack is not as well regarded as Goblin's earlier scores for "Deep Red", "Suspiria", or "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Dead%20%281978%20film%29">Dawn of the Dead</a>" (1978), <a href="Tim%20Lucas">Tim Lucas</a> felt it "... so fused to the fabric of the picture that "Tenebrae" might be termed ... a "giallo musicale"; that is, a "giallo" in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to occupy the same plane as the action and characters." Writers David Kerekes and David Slater were also favorable to the score; writing that the film "bristles with arresting imagery and a cracking musical score from ex-members of Goblin". Simonetti felt the score was good, but that it was only a "medium"-level success. However, it did enjoy a second wave of popularity being remixed in clubs. The album has had multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on the Italian Cinevox label.

"Tenebrae" had a wide theatrical release throughout Italy and mainland Europe, something Argento very much needed after having suffered major distribution problems with his previous film, "Inferno". Released on 28 October 1982, "Tenebrae" saw modest success at the box office in Italy and Europe, but it did not perform as well as some of Argento's previous films. In Italy, "Tenebrae" had been released with a <a href="Motion%20picture%20rating%20system%23Italy">VM18</a> rating, meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen. Argento had desired a VM14 rating, both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film's chances of commercial success. "Tenebrae" features scenes of female homosexuality; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time, and Argento said he wanted to "recount this subject freely and in an open manner, without interference or being ashamed". The VM18 rating upset him, as he believed it was a result of the sexual diversity on display rather than the film's violence.
One of the film's most excessively violent scenes features the death of Neal's ex-wife, Jane (played by <a href="Veronica%20Lario">Veronica Lario</a>). This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy. The original scene featured Jane's arm being cut off at the elbow; blood sprays from the wound onto white walls until the character falls to the floor. After a back-and-forth between Argento and Italian censors (at the time a panel of judges), the scene was first trimmed from showing an "immense" spray to a small one, then a smaller one still. The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s, when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>. According to Alan Jones, Berlusconi "did not want the public seeing [Lario] so explicitly murdered, even if it was in a film by his country's premier horror expert". For a few years, it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally, as prints were withdrawn altogether. A later DVD release did become available, with the scene restored.

Averaging a murder every ten minutes, "Tenebrae" ranks as one of Argento's bloodiest films. In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of "sexualized violence" by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> prior to its theatrical release, on 19 May 1983. The advertising campaign for "Tenebrae" featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a woman with her throat cut, blood dripping from the wound. According to Jones, who worked for "Tenebrae"s distributor at the time, in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> refused to run them. New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon. A similar change was made to the soundtrack sleeve.

In the United States the film remained unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version under the title "Unsane". It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing nearly all of the film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of "Tenebrae" received nearly unanimously negative reviews.

"Tenebrae" has been released on home media in many different versions in numerous territories. In 1983, when the VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom, it was short by about four seconds. However, the film soon found itself included in a list of thirty-nine so-called "<a href="video%20nasty">video nasties</a>" that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK video stores under the <a href="Video%20Recordings%20Act%201984">Video Recordings Act 1984</a>. Deemed harmful to audiences, "video nasties" were strongly criticized for their violent content by the press, social commentators and various religious organizations. Speculating in 2011, Thomas Rostock said that the higher-than-usual murder count for an Argento film was partially responsible, while James Gracey believed it was perhaps "the highly sexualized presentation of its violent content". He went on to say, "Of all the titles placed on the video nasty list, "Tenebrae" is perhaps the most misunderstood and undeserving of the grimy status it gained through its association with the whole debacle." Kim Newman agreed that "Tenebrae"s reputation as a "video nasty" was unwarranted, saying that none of the on-screen deaths are as gory or lingering as those in Argento's previous films. He also believed "Tenebrae" would eventually be remembered on its own merits, rather than as part of the "video nasties" list. Nevertheless, the ban lasted until 1999, when "Tenebrae" was legally released on videotape with one second of footage removed in addition to the previously censored five. In 2003, the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it without any cuts. In Germany, the release was strongly cut, and reportedly seized by the authorities.

The film has since been released on DVD in the US, mostly uncut save for approximately twenty seconds of extraneous material. "Tenebrae" received an initial DVD release in March 1999 from <a href="Anchor%20Bay%20Entertainment">Anchor Bay Entertainment</a>, with a re-release in May 2008. The Anchor Bay release, though presented as "uncut" was not the fully restored version of the film. A DVD German release by Raptor was also missing about one-and-a-half seconds of material. In June 2011, <a href="Arrow%20Films">Arrow Films</a> issued a special edition on DVD, but although the image quality was far better than in previous DVD releases, this version was "heavily lambasted" for carrying a transfer of the film that had visible <a href="noise%20%28video%29">noise</a> and "distorted audio". In 2013, Arrow released a Blu-ray edition that corrected the audio and video problems. Additional corrections were made to the transfer and released by <a href="Synapse%20Films">Synapse Films</a> in 2016, as a steelbook edition limited to 3000 copies. The Arrow & Synapse DVD and Blu-ray releases are "completely uncut".

"Tenebrae" has come to be considered one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics, with some calling it his last great film. <a href="AllMovie">AllMovie</a> refers to the film as "one of Dario Argento's best thrillers". In her 1994 book on the director, "Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento," Maitland McDonagh maintains that "Tenebrae" is "in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made." Richard Dyer, writing for the "Directory of World Cinema: Italy", describes the film as a "tease", one which is "perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction: being outwitted, wrong-footed, led up the garden path". Dyer believes that the degree of lighting used in the film is unsurpassed. Ed Gonzalez of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" said that "Tenebrae" "is a riveting defense of auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare." Keith Phipps of "The A.V. Club" noted "... Argento makes some points about the intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the real reason to watch." Almar Haflidason, in a review for <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>, opined, "Sadistically beautiful and viciously exciting, welcome to true terror with Dario Argento's shockingly relentless "Tenebrae"." Tim Lucas in "<a href="Video%20Watchdog">Video Watchdog</a>" said, "Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma thriller, "Tenebrae" contains more likeable characters, believable relationships, and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento film." Gordon Sullivan of <a href="DVD%20Verdict">DVD Verdict</a> wrote, ""Tenebre" is a straight-up "giallo" in the old-school tradition. It may have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. We've got all the usual suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately seventy-two twists before all is revealed ... For fans of Argento's earlier "giallo", this is a must-see."

Not all of the recent critical reaction to "Tenebrae" has been positive. <a href="Geoff%20Andrew">Geoff Andrew</a> of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" thought that the film was "unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards". John Kenneth Muir, author of "Horror Films of the 1980s", considers the film to be far inferior to "Suspiria", but acknowledges that it was so "unremittingly gory" that it justified its US title of "Unsane". John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a "technically mesmeric" one, felt that thematically it was a "disappointingly retrograde step" for Argento. <a href="Christopher%20Null">Christopher Null</a> of <a href="Filmcritic.com">Filmcritic.com</a> called it a "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick", while <a href="Dennis%20Schwartz">Dennis Schwartz</a> of "Ozus' World Movie Reviews" dismissed it as "trash". Gary Johnson, editor of "Images", complained, "Not much of "Tenebre" makes much sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And these are some of the bloodiest murders of Argento's career." In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, ""Tenebre" is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic ... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors".

Coming at the tail end of the "giallo" cycle, "Tenebrae" does not appear to have been as influential as Argento's earlier films. Douglas E. Winter, however, has commented that "Tenebrae"s Louma crane sequence has been stylistically influential, pointing to its use in <a href="Brian%20De%20Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s "<a href="The%20Untouchables%20%281987%20film%29">The Untouchables</a>" (1987). In addition, towards the end of the film, with Neal supposedly dead, the camera faces Detective Giermani directly. When he stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor, Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot. Alan Jones cited "Tenebrae" as the first film to use this specific type of <a href="Blocking%20%28stage%29">camera blocking</a>, and believes it to have been copied and referenced deliberately by later filmmakers. One such example, discussed as an unacknowledged "steal" from "Tenebrae", is De Palma's "surprise reveal" of <a href="John%20Lithgow">John Lithgow</a> standing behind a victim in "<a href="Raising%20Cain">Raising Cain</a>" (1992). <a href="Robert%20Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>'s "<a href="What%20Lies%20Beneath">What Lies Beneath</a>" (2000) also contains a similar moment, although Zemeckis has denied a familiarity with Italian movies.

The final death scene in "Tenebrae" – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a sculpture – is directly referenced in <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>'s Hitchcockian murder mystery "<a href="Dead%20Again">Dead Again</a>" (1991). Kim Newman maintains that Branagh's film imitates the sequence so entirely – with <a href="Derek%20Jacobi">Derek Jacobi</a> being pierced by the sculpture – that Branagh must have included the reference deliberately. The subsequent moment, where Nicolodi screams repeatedly in the rain, was cited by <a href="Asia%20Argento">Asia Argento</a> (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.

Deathrow (video game)

Deathrow is a <a href="sports%20video%20game">sports video game</a> developed by <a href="Southend%20Interactive">Southend Interactive</a> and published by <a href="Ubi%20Soft">Ubi Soft</a>. It was released as an <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> <a href="Video%20game%20console">gaming system</a> exclusive on 18 October 2002 in Europe and four days later in North America. "Deathrow" development began in May 1999 as an online <a href="personal%20computer">PC</a> (player computer) game. In early 2001, Southend transitioned to an Xbox console release, which let the team use <a href="pixel%20shaders">pixel shaders</a>, <a href="bump%20map">bump map</a>ped textures, and <a href="specular%20lighting">specular lighting</a>. "Deathrow" was built on an in-house 3D <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> and was Southend's first full release.

The game is based on the fictional <a href="extreme%20sport">extreme sport</a> Blitz, a <a href="futuristic">futuristic</a> <a href="full-contact">full-contact</a> hybrid of <a href="hockey">hockey</a> and basketball played with a <a href="flying%20disc">flying disc</a>. Two teams of four players attempt to move the disc through their opponent's goal, and teams can either win on points or by knocking out their opposing team. There are 150 individual characters across 18 thematic teams. The <a href="single-player">single-player</a> campaign's plot is set in the 23rd century, when Blitz is a popular, televised sport and the teams battle to scale the ranks and win the championship. Players earn credits from their goals scored, opponent knockouts, and crowd-pleasing to be spent on player upgrades, bets, and new teammates. The game also supports <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split-screen</a> and <a href="System%20Link">System Link</a> multiplayer for up to eight players across up to eight Xbox consoles.

"Deathrow" received largely favorable reviews. Reviewers praised the game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained of its high difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others thought it was a highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically "<a href="Speedball%20%28video%20game%29">Speedball</a>". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "<a href="TeamXbox">TeamXbox</a>" both named "Deathrow" an Editor's Choice. The game won the "TeamXbox" 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.

"Deathrow" is set in the year 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to toss a disc through a hoop while avoiding <a href="full-contact">full-contact</a> from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a>, the sport combines elements of <a href="hockey">hockey</a>, basketball, and full-contact <a href="American%20football">American football</a>. Critics compared the game's mechanics to "<a href="Discs%20of%20Tron">Discs of Tron</a>", "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>", "<a href="Blood%20Bowl">Blood Bowl</a>", "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>"s <a href="Blitzball%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Blitzball</a>, "<a href="Blades%20of%20Steel">Blades of Steel</a>", and "<a href="Speedball%20%28video%20game%29">Speedball</a>", and its aesthetic to that of "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>". The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film "<a href="Rollerball%20%281975%20film%29">Rollerball</a>".

There are four rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">computer</a> or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight feet off the ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, and the game continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points at the end of a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. <a href="Friendly%20fire">Friendly fire</a>, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.

There are 150 unique players on 18 teams, each with thematic personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and teamwork. Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear <a href="battledress">camouflaged garb</a> and use <a href="military%20jargon">military jargon</a>), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one half with traditional, open-style stadiums, and the other half with environmental obstacles, such as the <a href="underground%20mining">underground mines</a>. Minor <a href="power-ups">power-ups</a> including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.

Players earn credits for knocking out opponents, scoring points, and impressing the crowd with violence and skill. The credits can be used towards player enhancements such as <a href="black%20market">black market</a> <a href="performance-enhancing%20drugs">performance-enhancing drugs</a>. A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> found the game to heavily rely on teamwork. <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">Computer players</a> on teams rated with low teamwork will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised over the course of a game. Players can call plays including physical offense, fast offense, neutral, defense, and goal defense.

The game supports <a href="single-player">single-player</a>, four-player <a href="local%20multiplayer">local multiplayer</a>, and <a href="System%20Link">System Link</a> with up to eight players across up to eight Xbox consoles, but does not support <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> <a href="online%20play">online play</a>. "Deathrow" has a futuristic <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a> soundtrack and over 3,000 words of voice acting. It also supports <a href="5.1%20surround%20sound">5.1 surround sound</a> and customized soundtracks. The game is <a href="backward%20compatible">backward compatible</a> <a href="List%20of%20Xbox%20games%20compatible%20with%20Xbox%20360">with the Xbox 360</a>.

Players use the Xbox controller's left <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> to move the character, the right stick to <a href="Strafing%20%28gaming%29">strafe</a>, and the main buttons to jump, block, punch, and kick. When on offense, the latter two functions become "pass" and "shoot". Players switch between characters and taunt with the white and black buttons, respectively, and <a href="Play-calling">call plays</a> with the directional pad. The left trigger modifies an existing action, such as running into dives, slide-tackles, and grabs, and the right trigger orients the camera towards the objective (either the disc or the goal, depending on the team in possession). This camera control is designed for precision when diving for the disc or shooting on goal. A character in possession of the disc will show a trajectory line of their potential shot or pass, which is altered by player movement, breath, and physical contact. Players charge the disc by holding the shooting button, whereby the disc turns greener as the shot grows more powerful. A fully charged shot called a Deathrow will incapacitate any player it hits, while overcharged shots electrify and stun the carrier.

Before each game and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a trailing third-person shot similar to looking over the player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.

The in-game story of Blitz begins in 2197 as a Los Angeles gang sport used to find recruits. Over 20 years later, the illegal sport is picked up for broadcast by the Prime Network, who forms the Blitz Disc Association (BDA) and plans for the first Blitz competition with exhibition games and prize money. Through exhibition games and prize money, 13 teams of humans with various competitive augmentations are chosen to compete.

Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team against the ranked hierarchy en route to the championship. Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably moving on to the next division.

The player's team receives randomized, team-specific textual messages in between games, including offers for <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> offers, training sessions, drugs, bets on the player's performance, and events including accidental gifts from the player's manager, threats from the team's owner, and <a href="organized%20crime">organized crime</a> extortions. Players can buy character attribute increases with their credits. Single-player progress unlocks concept art and game assets external to the game, as well as new teams, players, and arenas. Each of the unlockable 13 teams has six unlockable players (for a total of 10 players on each), and five additional legacy teams are limited to four players apiece. Multi-disc and "Extreme" <a href="difficulty%20level">difficulty</a> gameplay options are also unlockable.

"Deathrow" was developed by <a href="Southend%20Interactive">Southend Interactive</a> and produced by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. Five friends opened Southend in <a href="Malm%C3%B6%2C%20Sweden">Malmö, Sweden</a> in 1998 to fulfill their childhood ambitions to make video games. Southend began "Deathrow" development in May 1999 and expected the game to be an online <a href="personal%20computer">PC</a> video game tentatively titled "Blitz Disc Arena". The idea for the sports game descended from a combination of "<a href="Speedball%202">Speedball 2</a>", the "<a href="Quake%20%28series%29">Quake</a>" and <a href="Unreal%20%28video%20game%20series%29">"Unreal" series</a>, and "<a href="Tekken">Tekken</a>". Southend's nine-person team received Xbox <a href="development%20kits">development kits</a> in June 2000 and decided to move the game to console in early 2001. According to Southend animator Rodrigo Cespedes in a 2002 "<a href="TeamXbox">TeamXbox</a>" interview, "Xbox was the only console that would allow [them] to produce the game as it was originally envisioned", adding that <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> encouraged the mature direction with emphasis on blood, brutality, and profanity. Thus they began to port the game to the console for its feature capabilities, including <a href="vertex%20shaders">vertex</a> and <a href="pixel%20shaders">pixel shaders</a> for <a href="bump%20map">bump map</a>ped environmental textures and character animations, <a href="Specular%20highlight">specular lighting</a>, and bumped reflection mapping.

The game was developed on an in-house 3D <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> under construction for multiple years. Each character is made of over 7000 polygons and 55 bones, making for players with facial expressions, over 800 animations, and a capacity to blink. Character faces can additionally express emotions like happiness or anger, and feelings of pain. The move to Xbox led to greater variation in the team personalities. The artists drew many options for each team and the developers chose from the lot. "Deathrow" was designed for the Action camera view, but Sports view was introduced to expand the game's appeal.

"Deathrow" was displayed at Ubisoft's <a href="E3%202002">E3 2002</a> booth, and was released on 18 October 2002 in Europe, and on 22 October 2002 in the United States as an Xbox exclusive. The game did not include Xbox Live online multiplayer for want of development time. At the time of release, Southend had no plans to release <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>, though they implemented a method to do so. The game was Southend's first full release.

"Deathrow" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. IGN and "TeamXbox" both named "Deathrow" an Editor's Choice. The game won "TeamXbox" 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and IGN's 2002 Best Xbox Game Nobody Played. It was also runner-up for their Xbox action game of the year. IGN felt that of the year's praiseworthy yet unappreciated games, "Deathrow" alone "truly blew [them] away". Critics praised the game's fast, chaotic action and use of surround sound. The reviewers bemoaned its high difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some reviewers thought the game used profanity excessively, while others considered it a highlight.

David Hodgson of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" ("EGM") found "Deathrow" European origins apparent as "awkward, over-the-top expletives in obnoxious American accents" were paired with rugby. Hodgson said that "Deathrow" struggled to show grittiness in a very shiny environment. He added that the game suffered from immoderate violence, frustrating fighting sequences, lack of online play, and "steep learning curve". Hodgson compared the core mechanics to a "mini-game masquerading as sports entertainment". William Racer of the "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" ("OXM") praised the fast-paced nature of the game and its eye for detail, and complained about the camera angles and difficulty. He placed the game in a lineage of invented sports from a dystopian future and found the game more entertaining than the rest. Racer also found the music generic, and the voice acting good. Eric Bush of "TeamXbox" complimented the computer opponents's artificial intelligence and said that they put up a challenge. "<a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>" Osborne appreciated the game's small details like the streak trailing the disc through the air. IGN's Kaiser Hwang called the arena lighting effects, <a href="bump%20mapping">bump mapping</a>, and textures the best since "". <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, "OXM" Racer, and IGN's Douglass Perry and David Clayman recommended "Deathrow" as a <a href="party%20game">party game</a>, with the IGN staff specifically recommending the game with System Link.

"<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> spoke highly of the tight controls and accessible gameplay in spite of a larger learning curve. IGN's Goldstein described the controls as "relatively simple" and easy to understand within a single game, and Scott Osborne of "GameSpy" found the controls awkward but easily learned. In comparison, Charles Herold of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and a friend could not figure out Blitz's rules for 20 minutes, feeling "too macho" to do the tutorial. "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" Jonathan Silver thought the gameplay was too frenzied, like ""<a href="NHL%20Hitz">NHL Hitz</a>" on <a href="steroids">steroids</a>". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's looseness. She noted the game's "serious attitude" and "very gritty view of sports", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was "one of the nicest aspects" of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded "Deathrow"s profanity as the "best use of endless cursing in a game... ever". Herold of "The New York Times" noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the "savage profanities", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games. He added that the game's frantic speed kept him too consumed to curse at the game himself. "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" Troy Oxford also connected the profanity to the game's "<a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board%23Ratings">'M' rating</a>".

"<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" referred to "Deathrow" as a substance-less and "contrived <a href="Video%20game%20clone">clone</a>" of the 1990 "Speedball 2", which used a ball instead of a disc. David Hodgson of "EGM" similarly praised the 1990 title in comparison. William Racer of "OXM" did not mind the two games' similarities and added that "you might as well copy from the best". While Kasavin of "GameSpot" thought the theme was tired, "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" Oxford wrote that the game felt "fresh". Reflecting on the release year, IGN director Peer Schneider said that games like "Deathrow" showed the games industry's ability to make new, high-caliber franchises. Two IGN staffers predicted the game to be a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>: one noted the sparse press compared to the game's quality, and the other explained that Ubisoft was busy promoting bigger titles such as "<a href="Tom%20Clancy%27s%20Splinter%20Cell%20%28video%20game%29">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>", "", and "<a href="Rayman">Rayman</a>".

In 2006, "TeamXbox" Matthew Fisher determined that the game aged well. In 2012, "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex Gaming</a>" listed "Deathrow" 13th on its 15 Most Violent Sports Video Games. Scottish developer Ludometrics described their 2014 video game "Bodycheck" as a spiritual successor to "Deathrow", "Speedball 2", and "<a href="Skateball">Skateball</a>", though the game is set in the medieval past instead of the ultraviolent future.

Around the time of launch, Southend was interested in producing a sequel. In March 2004, IGN listed "Deathrow 2" as one of its five desired Xbox sequels, specifically for Xbox Live online play support. IGN placed its chances at a 90% likelihood. IGN reported a month later that despite interest from Southend, <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> would be unlikely to release a forthcoming "Deathrow" sequel due to the original's low revenue. Southend separated from its Swedish IT consulting firm parent company, Tacet Holding AB, and became a fully independent company in April 2013. With it, Southend CEO Fredrik Brönjemark announced that "now is the right time for Southend to manage its own destiny and to invest in its own products", of which "Deathrow" and "<a href="ilomilo">ilomilo</a>" were examples. Southend closed in June 2013 when its full 24-person staff was hired into <a href="Massive%20Entertainment">Massive Entertainment</a>, another Swedish developer.

Birmingham campaign

The Birmingham campaign, or Birmingham movement, was a movement organized in early 1963 by the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) to bring attention to the integration efforts of <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>. Led by <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, <a href="James%20Bevel">James Bevel</a>, <a href="Fred%20Shuttlesworth">Fred Shuttlesworth</a> and others, the campaign of <a href="nonviolent">nonviolent</a> <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a> culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws.

In the early 1960s, Birmingham was one of the most racially divided cities in the United States, both as enforced by law and culturally. Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregated</a> city in the country. Protests in Birmingham began with a <a href="boycott">boycott</a> led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end segregation in public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer <a href="Wyatt%20Tee%20Walker">Wyatt Tee Walker</a> joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C, a series of <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a>s and marches intended to provoke mass arrests.

When the campaign ran low on adult volunteers, James Bevel, SCLC's Director of Direct Action, thought of the idea of having students become the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign. He then trained and directed high school, college, and elementary school students in nonviolence, and asked them to participate in the demonstrations by taking a peaceful walk fifty at a time from the <a href="16th%20Street%20Baptist%20Church">16th Street Baptist Church</a> to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation. This resulted in over a thousand arrests, and, as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students, the Birmingham Police Department, led by <a href="Eugene%20%26quot%3BBull%26quot%3B%20Connor">Eugene "Bull" Connor</a>, used high-pressure water hoses and police <a href="attack%20dog">attack dog</a>s on the children and adult bystanders. Not all of the bystanders were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely <a href="nonviolent">nonviolent</a> walk, but the students held to the nonviolent premise. King and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm's way.

The Birmingham campaign was a model of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his job, forced desegregation in Birmingham, and directly paved the way for the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States.

Birmingham, Alabama was, in 1963, "probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States," according to King. Although the city's population of almost 350,000 was 60% white and 40% black, Birmingham had no black police officers, firefighters, sales clerks in department stores, bus drivers, bank tellers, or store cashiers. Black secretaries could not work for white professionals. Jobs available to black workers were limited to <a href="manual%20labor">manual labor</a> in Birmingham's steel mills, work in household service and yard maintenance, or work in black neighborhoods. When <a href="layoff">layoff</a>s were necessary, black employees were often the first to go. The <a href="unemployment%20rate">unemployment rate</a> for black people was two and a half times higher than for white people. The average income for black employees in the city was less than half that of white employees. Significantly lower pay scales for black workers at the local steel mills were common. Racial segregation of public and commercial facilities throughout Jefferson County was legally required, covered all aspects of life, and was rigidly enforced. Only 10 percent of the city's black population was registered to vote in 1960.

In addition, Birmingham's economy was stagnating as the city was shifting from <a href="blue%20collar">blue collar</a> to <a href="White-collar%20worker">white collar</a> jobs. According to "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine in 1958, the only thing white workers had to gain from <a href="desegregation">desegregation</a> was more competition from black workers. Fifty unsolved racially motivated bombings between 1945 and 1962 had earned the city the nickname "<a href="Bombingham">Bombingham</a>". A neighborhood shared by white and black families experienced so many attacks that it was called "Dynamite Hill". Black churches in which civil rights were discussed became specific targets for attack.

Birmingham's black population began to organize to effect change. After Alabama <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People%20v.%20Alabama">banned the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) in 1956, Reverend <a href="Fred%20Shuttlesworth">Fred Shuttlesworth</a> formed the <a href="Alabama%20Christian%20Movement%20for%20Human%20Rights">Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights</a> (ACMHR) the same year to challenge the city's segregation policies through <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>s and protests. When the courts overturned the segregation of the city's parks, the city responded by closing them. Shuttlesworth's home was repeatedly bombed, as was Bethel Baptist Church, where he was pastor. After Shuttlesworth was arrested and jailed for violating the city's segregation rules in 1962, he sent a <a href="petition">petition</a> to Mayor Art Hanes' office asking that public facilities be desegregated. Hanes responded with a letter informing Shuttlesworth that his petition had been thrown in the garbage. Looking for outside help, Shuttlesworth invited Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC to Birmingham, saying, "If you come to Birmingham, you will not only gain prestige, but really shake the country. If you win in Birmingham, as Birmingham goes, so goes the nation."

King and the SCLC had recently been involved in a campaign to desegregate the city of <a href="Albany%2C%20Georgia">Albany, Georgia</a>, but did not see the results they had anticipated. Described by historian Henry Hampton as a "morass", the <a href="Albany%20Movement">Albany movement</a> lost momentum and stalled. King's reputation had been hurt by the Albany campaign, and he was eager to improve it. Determined not to make the same mistakes in Birmingham, King and the SCLC changed several of their strategies. In Albany, they concentrated on the desegregation of the city as a whole. In Birmingham, their campaign tactics focused on more narrowly defined goals for the downtown shopping and government district. These goals included the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown stores, fair hiring practices in shops and city employment, the reopening of public parks, and the creation of a bi-racial committee to oversee the desegregation of Birmingham's public schools. King summarized the philosophy of the Birmingham campaign when he said: "The purpose of ... direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation".

A significant factor in the success of the Birmingham campaign was the structure of the city government and the personality of its contentious Commissioner of Public Safety, <a href="Bull%20Connor">Eugene "Bull" Connor</a>. Described as an "arch-segregationist" by "Time" magazine, Connor asserted that the city "ain't gonna segregate no niggers and whites together in this town ". He also apparently believed that the Civil Rights Movement was a Communist plot, and after the churches were bombed, Connor blamed the violence on local black citizens. 
Birmingham's government was set up in such a way that it gave Connor powerful influence. In 1958, police arrested ministers organizing a bus boycott. When the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) initiated a probe amid allegations of police misconduct for the arrests, Connor responded that he "[hadn't] got any damn apology to the FBI or anybody else", and predicted, "If the North keeps trying to cram this thing [desegregation] down our throats, there's going to be bloodshed." In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when <a href="Freedom%20Ride">Freedom Ride</a>rs were beaten by local mobs. The police harassed religious leaders and protest organizers by ticketing cars parked at mass meetings and entering the meetings in <a href="Undercover">plainclothes</a> to take notes. The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for "phantom fire hazards". Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> later said of him, "The Civil Rights movement should thank God for Bull Connor. He's helped it as much as Abraham Lincoln."

Turmoil in the mayor's office also weakened the Birmingham city government in its opposition to the campaign. Connor, who had run for several elected offices in the months leading up to the campaign, had lost all but the race for Public Safety Commissioner. Because they believed Connor's extreme conservatism slowed progress for the city as a whole, a group of white political moderates worked to defeat him. The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to <a href="Albert%20Boutwell">Albert Boutwell</a>, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that their terms not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.

Modeled on the <a href="Montgomery%20Bus%20Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>, protest actions in Birmingham began in 1962, when students from local colleges arranged for a year of staggered boycotts. They caused downtown business to decline by as much as 40 percent, which attracted attention from Chamber of Commerce president Sidney Smyer, who commented that the "racial incidents have given us a black eye that we'll be a long time trying to forget". In response to the boycott, the City Commission of Birmingham punished the black community by withdrawing $45,000 ($ in 2019) from a surplus-food program used primarily by low-income black families. The result, however, was a black community more motivated to resist.

The SCLC decided that economic pressure on Birmingham businesses would be more effective than pressure on politicians, a lesson learned in Albany as few black citizens were registered to vote in 1962. In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year. Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district. For six weeks supporters of the boycott patrolled the downtown area to make sure black shoppers were not patronizing stores that promoted or tolerated segregation. If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott. Shuttlesworth recalled a woman whose $15 hat ($ in 2019) was destroyed by boycott enforcers. Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled, "We had to go under strict surveillance. We had to tell people, say look: if you go downtown and buy something, you're going to have to answer to us." After several business owners in Birmingham took down "white only" and "colored only" signs, Commissioner Connor told business owners that if they did not obey the segregation ordinances, they would lose their business licenses.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s presence in Birmingham was not welcomed by all in the black community. A local black attorney complained in "Time" that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner <a href="A.%20G.%20Gaston">A. G. Gaston</a> agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the "demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected".

Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. <a href="Wyatt%20Tee%20Walker">Wyatt Tee Walker</a>, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: "My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South." He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for "confrontation". Organizers believed their <a href="Telephone%20tapping">phones were tapped</a>, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.

The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to "the biggest and baddest city of the South". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches.

The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a>s at libraries and lunch counters, kneel-ins by black visitors at white churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a voter-registration drive. Most businesses responded by refusing to serve demonstrators. Some white spectators at a sit-in at a <a href="F.%20W.%20Woolworth%20Company">Woolworth's</a> lunch counter spat upon the participants. A few hundred protesters, including jazz musician <a href="Al%20Hibbler">Al Hibbler</a>, were arrested, although Hibbler was immediately released by Connor.

The SCLC's goals were to fill the jails with protesters to force the city government to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect the functioning of the city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of "The Birmingham World", the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered <a href="Loveman%27s%20of%20Alabama">Loveman's department store</a> to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place." King promised a protest every day until "peaceful equality had been assured" and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.

On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> barring the protests and subsequently raised <a href="bail%20bond">bail bond</a> for those arrested from $200 to $1,500 ($ to $ in 2019). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a "flagrant denial of our constitutional rights" and organizers prepared to defy the order. The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign. King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success. In a press release they explained, "We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation". Incoming mayor <a href="Albert%20Boutwell">Albert Boutwell</a> called King and the SCLC organizers "strangers" whose only purpose in Birmingham was "to stir inter-racial discord". Connor promised, "You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall."

The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, <a href="Ralph%20Abernathy">Ralph Abernathy</a> spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: "The eyes of the world are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are you ready, are you ready to make the challenge? I am ready to go to jail, are you?" With Abernathy, King was among 50 Birmingham residents ranging in age from 15 to 81 years who were arrested on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a>, April 12, 1963. It was King's 13th arrest.

Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order "to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation".

Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King">Coretta Scott King</a> did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy">Jacqueline Kennedy</a> called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.

Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay "<a href="Letter%20from%20Birmingham%20Jail">Letter from Birmingham Jail</a>". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that "Letter from Birmingham Jail" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham. After King's arrest, the chains' profits began to erode. National business owners pressed the Kennedy administration to intervene. King was released on April 20, 1963.

Despite the publicity surrounding King's arrest, the campaign was faltering because few demonstrators were willing to risk arrest. In addition, although Connor had used police dogs to assist in the arrest of demonstrators, this did not attract the media attention that organizers had hoped for. To re-energize the campaign, SCLC organizer <a href="James%20Bevel">James Bevel</a> devised a controversial alternative plan he named D Day that was later called the "Children's Crusade" by "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" magazine. D Day called for students from Birmingham elementary schools and high schools as well as nearby <a href="Miles%20College">Miles College</a> to take part in the demonstrations.

Bevel, a veteran of earlier nonviolent student protests with the <a href="Nashville%20Student%20Movement">Nashville Student Movement</a> and SNCC, had been named SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education. After initiating the idea he organized and educated the students in nonviolence tactics and philosophy. King hesitated to approve the use of children, but Bevel believed that children were appropriate for the demonstrations because jail time for them would not hurt families economically as much as the loss of a working parent. He also saw that adults in the black community were divided about how much support to give the protests. Bevel and the organizers knew that high school students were a more cohesive group; they had been together as classmates since kindergarten. He recruited girls who were school leaders and boys who were athletes. Bevel found girls more receptive to his ideas because they had less experience as victims of white violence. When the girls joined, however, the boys were close behind.

Bevel and the SCLC held workshops to help students overcome their fear of dogs and jails. They showed films of the <a href="Nashville%20sit-ins">Nashville sit-ins</a> organized in 1960 to end segregation at public lunch counters. Birmingham's black radio station, <a href="WENN%20%28AM%29">WENN</a>, supported the new plan by telling students to arrive at the demonstration meeting place with a toothbrush to be used in jail. Flyers were distributed in black schools and neighborhoods that said, "Fight for freedom first then go to school" and "It's up to you to free our teachers, our parents, yourself, and our country."

On May 2, 1963, 7th grader Gwendolyn Sanders helped organize her classmates, and hundreds of kids from high schoolers down to first graders who joined her in a massive walkout defying the principal of Parker High School who attempted to lock the gates to keep students inside. Demonstrators were given instructions to march to the downtown area, to meet with the Mayor, and integrate the chosen buildings. They were to leave in smaller groups and continue on their courses until arrested. Marching in disciplined ranks, some of them using <a href="walkie-talkies">walkie-talkies</a>, they were sent at timed intervals from various churches to the downtown business area. More than 600 students were arrested; the youngest of these was reported to be eight years old. Children left the churches while singing hymns and "freedom songs" such as "<a href="We%20Shall%20Overcome">We Shall Overcome</a>". They clapped and laughed while being arrested and awaiting transport to jail. The mood was compared to that of a school picnic. Although Bevel informed Connor that the march was to take place, Connor and the police were dumbfounded by the numbers and behavior of the children. They assembled <a href="paddy%20wagon">paddy wagon</a>s and school buses to take the children to jail. When no squad cars were left to block the city streets, Connor, whose authority extended to the fire department, used fire trucks. The day's arrests brought the total number of jailed protesters to 1,200 in the 900-capacity Birmingham jail. <a href="Lola%20Hendricks">Lola Hendricks</a>' nine-year-old daughter, Audrey Faye Hendricks (1952–2009) was the only child in her class to participate in that protest. She was also the youngest known child to be arrested for it. The children's book "The Youngest Marcher: The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks, A Young Civil Rights Activist" (2017) by Cynthia Levinson, is about that.

The use of children proved very controversial. Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell and Attorney General <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> condemned the decision to use children in the protests. Kennedy was reported in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" as saying, "an injured, maimed, or dead child is a price that none of us can afford to pay", although adding, "I believe that everyone understands their just grievances must be resolved." <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> criticized the decision, saying, "Real men don't put their children on the firing line."

King, who had been silent and then out of town while Bevel was organizing the children, was impressed by the success of using them in the protests. That evening he declared at a mass meeting, "I have been inspired and moved by today. I have never seen anything like it." Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, "Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school." The D Day campaign received front page coverage by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and "The New York Times".

When Connor realized that the Birmingham jail was full, on May 3 he changed police tactics to keep protesters out of the downtown business area. Another thousand students gathered at the church and left to walk across <a href="Kelly%20Ingram%20Park">Kelly Ingram Park</a> while chanting, "We're going to walk, walk, walk. Freedom ... freedom ... freedom." As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, "or you'll get wet". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set at a level that would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed over the tops of cars by the force of the water. When the students crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, "Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work."

A.G. Gaston, who was appalled at the idea of using children, was on the phone with white attorney <a href="David%20Vann%20%28mayor%29">David Vann</a> trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered on the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use <a href="German%20shepherd">German shepherd</a> dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." At 3 p.m., the protest was over. During a kind of <a href="truce">truce</a>, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back."

A battle-hardened "<a href="Huntley-Brinkley%20Report">Huntley-Brinkley</a>" reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28photographer%29">Charles Moore</a>, who had previously worked with the "<a href="Montgomery%20Advertiser">Montgomery Advertiser</a>" and was now working for "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine, and <a href="Bill%20Hudson%20%28photographer%29">Bill Hudson</a>, with the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. Moore was a <a href="United%20States%20Marines">Marine</a> combat photographer who was "jarred" and "sickened" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in "Life". The first photo Moore shot that day showed <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28photographer%29">three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose</a>. It was titled "They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The "Life" photo became an "era-defining picture" and was compared to the photo of <a href="Raising%20the%20Flag%20on%20Iwo%20Jima">Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima</a>. Moore suspected that the film he shot "was likely to obliterate in the national <a href="Psyche%20%28psychology%29">psyche</a> any notion of a 'good southerner'." Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were "making pictures and staying alive" and "not getting bit by a dog."

Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him. Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer. He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, "The Birmingham World", who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for "parading without a permit", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, "Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one." Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position <a href="above%20the%20fold">above the fold</a> on the front page of "The New York Times" on May 4, 1963.

Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and police dogs attacking unprotected demonstrators. Such coverage and photos were given credit for shifting international support to the protesters and making Bull Connor "the villain of the era". President Kennedy told a group of people at the White House that "The New York Times" photo made him "sick". Kennedy called the scenes "shameful" and said that they were "so much more eloquently reported by the news camera than by any number of explanatory words."

The images also had a profound effect in Birmingham. Despite decades of disagreements, when the photos were released, "the black community was instantaneously consolidated behind King", according to David Vann, who would later serve as mayor of Birmingham. Horrified at what the Birmingham police were doing to protect segregation, New York Senator <a href="Jacob%20K.%20Javits">Jacob K. Javits</a> declared, "the country won't tolerate it", and pressed Congress to pass a civil rights bill. Similar reactions were reported by Kentucky Senator <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">Sherman Cooper</a>, and Oregon Senator <a href="Wayne%20Morse">Wayne Morse</a>, who compared Birmingham to <a href="South%20Africa%20under%20apartheid">South Africa under apartheid</a>. A "New York Times" editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police "a national disgrace." The "Washington Post" editorialized, "The spectacle in Birmingham ... must excite the sympathy of the rest of the country for the decent, just, and reasonable citizens of the community, who have so recently demonstrated at the polls their lack of support for the very policies that have produced the Birmingham riots. The authorities who tried, by these brutal means, to stop the freedom marchers do not speak or act in the name of the enlightened people of the city." President Kennedy sent Assistant Attorney General <a href="Burke%20Marshall">Burke Marshall</a> to Birmingham to help negotiate a truce. Marshall faced a <a href="stalemate">stalemate</a> when merchants and protest organizers refused to budge.
Black onlookers in the area of Kelly Ingram Park abandoned <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a> on May 5. Spectators taunted police, and SCLC leaders begged them to be peaceful or go home. James Bevel borrowed a <a href="bullhorn">bullhorn</a> from the police and shouted, "Everybody get off this corner. If you're not going to demonstrate in a nonviolent way, then leave!" Commissioner Connor was overheard saying, "If you'd ask half of them what freedom means, they couldn't tell you." To prevent further marches, Connor ordered the doors to the churches blocked to prevent students from leaving.

By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor transformed the stockade at the state fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Black protestors arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal</a>, and <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a> arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian <a href="Dick%20Gregory">Dick Gregory</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Deming">Barbara Deming</a>, a writer for "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>", were both arrested. The young <a href="Dan%20Rather">Dan Rather</a> reported for <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>. The car of <a href="Fannie%20Flagg">Fannie Flagg</a>, a local television personality and recent <a href="Miss%20Alabama">Miss Alabama</a> finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She rolled down the window and shouted to the children, "I'm with you all the way!"

Birmingham's fire department refused orders from Connor to turn the hoses on demonstrators again, and waded through the basement of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to clean up water from earlier fire-hose flooding. White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution but said they had no control over politics. Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.

The situation reached a crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast in the jail took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham <a href="Chamber%20of%20Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a> pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home. The editor of "<a href="The%20Birmingham%20News">The Birmingham News</a>" wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests.

Fire hoses were used once again, injuring police and Fred Shuttlesworth, as well as other demonstrators. Commissioner Connor expressed regret at missing seeing Shuttlesworth get hit and said he "wished they'd carried him away in a hearse". Another 1,000 people were arrested, bringing the total to 2,500.

News of the mass arrests of children had reached Western Europe and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The Soviet Union devoted up to 25 percent of its news broadcast to the demonstrations, sending much of it to Africa, where Soviet and U.S. interests clashed. Soviet news commentary accused the Kennedy administration of neglect and "inactivity". Alabama Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> sent <a href="state%20trooper">state trooper</a>s to assist Connor. Attorney General Robert Kennedy prepared to activate the <a href="Alabama%20National%20Guard">Alabama National Guard</a> and notified the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">Second Infantry Division</a> from <a href="Fort%20Benning">Fort Benning</a>, Georgia that it might be deployed to Birmingham.

No business of any kind was being conducted downtown. Organizers planned to flood the downtown area businesses with black people. Smaller groups of decoys were set out to distract police attention from activities at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Protesters set off false fire alarms to occupy the fire department and its hoses. One group of children approached a police officer and announced, "We want to go to jail!" When the officer pointed the way, the students ran across Kelly Ingram Park shouting, "We're going to jail!" Six hundred picketers reached downtown Birmingham. Large groups of protesters sat in stores and sang freedom songs. Streets, sidewalks, stores, and buildings were overwhelmed with more than 3,000 protesters. The sheriff and chief of police admitted to Burke Marshall that they did not think they could handle the situation for more than a few hours.

On May 8 at 4 a.m., white business leaders agreed to most of the protesters' demands. Political leaders held fast, however. The rift between the businessmen and the politicians became clear when business leaders admitted they could not guarantee the protesters' release from jail. On May 10, Fred Shuttlesworth and Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters that they had an agreement from the City of Birmingham to desegregate lunch counters, restrooms, drinking fountains and fitting rooms within 90 days, and to hire black people in stores as salesmen and clerks. Those in jail would be released on bond or their own recognizance. Urged by Kennedy, the <a href="United%20Auto%20Workers">United Auto Workers</a>, <a href="National%20Maritime%20Union">National Maritime Union</a>, United Steelworkers Union, and the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Labor%20and%20Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations">American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO) raised $237,000 in bail money ($ in 2019) to free the demonstrators. Commissioner Connor and the outgoing mayor condemned the resolution.

On the night of May 11, a bomb heavily damaged the Gaston Motel where King had been staying—and had left only hours before—and another damaged the house of <a href="Alfred%20Daniel%20Williams%20King">A. D. King</a>, Martin Luther King Jr.'s brother. When police went to inspect the motel, they were met with rocks and bottles from neighborhood black citizens. The arrival of state troopers only further angered the crowd; in the early hours of the morning, thousands of black people rioted, numerous buildings and vehicles were burned, and several people, including a police officer, were stabbed. By May 13, three thousand federal troops were deployed to Birmingham to restore order, even though Alabama Governor George Wallace told President Kennedy that state and local forces were sufficient. Martin Luther King Jr. returned to Birmingham to stress nonviolence.

Outgoing mayor Art Hanes left office after the Alabama State Supreme Court ruled that Albert Boutwell could take office on May 21, 1963. Upon picking up his last paycheck, Bull Connor remarked tearfully, "This is the worst day of my life." In June 1963, the <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow</a> signs regulating segregated public places in Birmingham were taken down.

Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and "settling for a lot less than even moderate demands". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.

The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Jobs%20and%20Freedom">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> where he delivered his most famous speech, "<a href="I%20Have%20a%20Dream">I Have a Dream</a>".
King became "Time"'s <a href="Time%20Magazine%20Person%20of%20the%20Year">Man of the Year</a> for 1963 and won the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1964.
The Birmingham campaign, as well as George Wallace's refusal to admit black students to the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a>, convinced President Kennedy to address the severe inequalities between black and white citizens in the South: "The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them." Despite the apparent lack of immediate local success after the Birmingham campaign, Fred Shuttlesworth and Wyatt Tee Walker pointed to its influence on national affairs as its true impact. President Kennedy's administration drew up the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act</a> bill. After being <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>ed for 75 days by "diehard southerners" in Congress, it was passed into law in 1964 and signed by President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>. The Civil Rights Act applied to the entire nation, prohibiting racial discrimination in employment and in access to public places. <a href="Roy%20Wilkins">Roy Wilkins</a> of the NAACP, however, disagreed that the Birmingham campaign was the primary force behind the Civil Rights Act. Wilkins gave credit to other movements, such as the <a href="Freedom%20Rides">Freedom Rides</a>, the integration of the <a href="University%20of%20Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a>, and campaigns to end public school segregation.

Birmingham's public schools were integrated in September 1963. Governor Wallace sent National Guard troops to keep black students out but President Kennedy reversed Wallace by ordering the troops to stand down. Violence continued to plague the city, however. Someone threw a <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> canister into Loveman's department store when it complied with the desegregation agreement; twenty people in the store required hospital treatment.
Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney <a href="Arthur%20Shores">Arthur Shores</a>, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> members <a href="16th%20Street%20Baptist%20Church%20bombing">bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church</a> on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant <a href="Gary%20Thomas%20Rowe">Gary Thomas Rowe</a> was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in <a href="Anniston%2C%20Alabama">Anniston, Alabama</a> on May 14, 1961. In addition, Rowe and several other Klansmen also partook in the killing of Civil Rights activist <a href="Viola%20Liuzzo">Viola Liuzzo</a> on March 25, 1965, in <a href="Lowndes%20County%2C%20Georgia">Lowndes County, Georgia</a> after the <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery march</a>.

The Birmingham campaign inspired the Civil Rights Movement in other parts of the South. Two days after King and Shuttlesworth announced the settlement in Birmingham, <a href="Medgar%20Evers">Medgar Evers</a> of the NAACP in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a> demanded a biracial committee to address concerns there. On June 12, 1963, Evers was fatally shot outside his home. He had been organizing demonstrations similar to those in Birmingham to pressure Jackson's city government. In 1965 Shuttlesworth assisted Bevel, King, and the SCLC to lead the <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a>, intended to increase voter registration among black citizens.

Historian Glenn Eskew wrote that the campaign "led to an awakening to the evils of segregation and a need for reforms in the region." According to Eskew, the riots that occurred after the bombing of the Gaston Motel foreshadowed rioting in larger cities later in the 1960s. ACMHR vice president Abraham Woods claimed that the rioting in Birmingham set a precedent for the "Burn, baby, burn" mindset, a cry used in later civic unrest in the <a href="Watts%20Riots">Watts Riots</a>, the <a href="12th%20Street%20riot">12th Street riot</a>s in Detroit, and other American cities in the 1960s. A study of the Watts riots concluded, "The 'rules of the game' in race relations were permanently changed in Birmingham."

Wyatt Tee Walker wrote that the Birmingham campaign was "legend" and had become the Civil Rights Movement's most important chapter. It was "the chief watershed of the nonviolent movement in the United States. It marked the maturation of the SCLC as a national force in the civil rights arena of the land that had been dominated by the older and stodgier NAACP." Walker called the Birmingham campaign and the Selma marches "Siamese twins" joining to "kill segregation ... and bury the body". Jonathan Bass declared that "King had won a tremendous public relations victory in Birmingham" but also stated pointedly that "it was the citizens of the Magic City, both black and white, and not Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC, that brought about the real transformation of the city."

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a <a href="Lego">Lego</a>-themed <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Traveller%27s%20Tales">Traveller's Tales</a> and published by <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> and <a href="TT%20Games%20Publishing">TT Games Publishing</a>. It was released on 11 September 2006. Part of the "<a href="Lego%20Star%20Wars%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Lego Star Wars</a>" series, it is based on the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" science fiction media franchise and <a href="Lego%20Group">Lego Group</a>'s <a href="Lego%20Star%20Wars">"Star Wars"-themed toy line</a>. It follows the events of the "Star Wars" films "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>" and "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>". The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessor—""; and the concept of "vehicle levels" was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at <a href="American%20International%20Toy%20Fair">American International Toy Fair</a> 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.

"Lego Star Wars II" was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and "adorable" portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> and <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20channel%29">Spike TV</a>, among others. A mobile phone adaptation, "Lego Star Wars II Mobile", was later developed by <a href="Universomo">Universomo</a>, published by <a href="THQ">THQ</a>, and released on 19 December 2006. "Lego Star Wars II" and were compiled in "", released in 2007.

"Lego Star Wars II"s gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> game world that contains objects, environments and characters designed to resemble <a href="Lego">Lego</a> pieces. Its gameplay—a combination of the <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a>, <a href="platform%20game">platform</a>, and sometimes <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle</a> genres—shares elements with that of "" (2005). While "Lego Star Wars" followed the events of "" (1999), "" (2002), and "" (2005), "Lego Star Wars II" is based on "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" (1977), "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>" (1980), and "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>" (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> meter, which is displayed on the game's <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a>. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.

The game's central location is the <a href="Mos%20Eisley">Mos Eisley</a> cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet <a href="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate <a href="cheat%20code">cheat code</a>s. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include <a href="Hoth">Hoth</a>, <a href="Bespin">Bespin</a>, <a href="Dagobah">Dagobah</a>, Tatooine, the <a href="Death%20Star">Death Star</a>, and <a href="Endor%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Endor</a>. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a <a href="TIE%20fighter">TIE fighter</a>, a <a href="Snowspeeder">Snowspeeder</a>, and the <a href="Millennium%20Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a>. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.

Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a "Star Wars" vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.

Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of <a href="Luke%20Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, <a href="Princess%20Leia">Princess Leia</a>, <a href="Han%20Solo">Han Solo</a>, <a href="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>, <a href="Lando%20Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>, <a href="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, <a href="C-3PO">C-3PO</a>, <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>, <a href="Wicket%20W.%20Warrick">Wicket</a> the <a href="Ewok">Ewok</a>, and <a href="Boba%20Fett">Boba Fett</a>. Character abilities have a greater role in "Lego Star Wars II" than in "Lego Star Wars". Certain characters armed with guns can use a <a href="grappling%20hook">grappling hook</a> in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, <a href="wikt%3Adouble%20jump">double jump</a> and use <a href="the%20Force">the Force</a>. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and <a href="Jawa%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Jawa</a> can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. <a href="Sith">Sith</a>, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a <a href="Chinese%20martial%20arts">kung-fu</a>-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities. This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the "Use Old Save" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from "Lego Star Wars" for use in free play; however, a "Lego Star Wars" saved game must be present on the same <a href="memory%20card">memory card</a> that contains "Lego Star Wars II"s save data.

Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, makes pieces for a <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name "Darth-3PO"); alternately, the player may create a name.

"Lego Star Wars II" was created by the <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> game developer <a href="Traveller%27s%20Tales">Traveller's Tales</a>. LucasArts — busy with other projects — had deferred publishing of "Lego Star Wars" to <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>, but regained the "necessary resources" to publish its sequel alongside <a href="TT%20Games%20Publishing">TT Games Publishing</a>. "Lego Star Wars II" was created for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">GameCube</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> (GBA), <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP), and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. Differences exist between platforms: the DS and GBA versions have some different playable characters than the other versions, and the DS and PSP versions support a "Wireless Lobby" for <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> gameplay.

"Lego Star Wars II" uses a modified "Lego Star Wars" <a href="game%20engine">engine</a>. However, many gameplay improvements were made over its predecessor, most notably camera angles and movement. Camera movement in co-op was a specific point of concern, as LucasArts received critical feedback from fans over this issue. Traveller's Tales looked to expand upon the concept of levels completed entirely in vehicles. These "vehicle levels" were explored more thoroughly in "Lego Star Wars II" than in its predecessor. In response to complaints from fans, LucasArts and Traveller's Tales granted the ability to build bricks to all non-droid characters. Character customization, an entirely new concept, was considered a significant improvement over the original game, and is one of three features highlighted on the game's final back cover. Tom Stone, director at Traveller's Tales, stated of the various improvements made over the original game:

The designers attempted to recreate the films' characters and events in a "cute" way. Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a "Return of the Jedi" scene where <a href="Luke%20Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker "performs an all-out acrobatic routine with all sorts of jumps from the plank. It's hilarious". LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, "unless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of [the characters] the first time you see them – you just have to. They're so darn cute!"

On 2 February 2006, images of the game were leaked to the Internet. However, they were quickly removed, and LucasArts, if telephoned, did not confirm or deny the game's development. The game was formally announced on 10 February, at <a href="American%20International%20Toy%20Fair">American International Toy Fair</a> 2006. A preview was later hosted at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) 2006. Because the original "Lego Star Wars" had been well received commercially and critically, selling 3.3 million copies by March 2006 and winning several awards, its sequel was highly anticipated by both fans of the original game and video game publications such as <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>. Shortly before the game's release, promotions were set up at chain stores across the United States, including <a href="Toys%20%26quot%3BR%26quot%3B%20Us">Toys "R" Us</a>, <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, <a href="Target%20Corporation">Target</a>, <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a>, <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a>, and <a href="Circuit%20City%20%281949%20company%29">Circuit City</a>.

In Europe, "Lego Star Wars II" was released on 11 September 2006, for PC, Xbox, GameCube, GBA, DS, and Xbox 360; on 15 September for PlayStation 2; and on 10 November for PSP. The game's North American release fell on 12 September for all platforms, coinciding with the release of the individual two-disc <a href="DVD">DVD</a> releases of the films on which it was based. The game's Australian release fell on 15 September for all platforms, but the Xbox 360 version was not released in this region. The OS X version of the game was released in 2007. The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS versions were the only versions that saw release in Japan, which occurred on 2 November 2006. The game received a rating of E10+ from the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (for "cartoon violence" and "crude humor"), 3+ from <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">PEGI</a>, and A from <a href="Computer%20Entertainment%20Rating%20Organization">CERO</a>.

A mobile phone adaptation of the game was developed by <a href="Universomo">Universomo</a> and published by <a href="THQ">THQ</a>. It was released on 19 December 2006. Several gameplay features — such as <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional graphics</a>, limited character selection, and coverage only of the film "Star Wars" — distinguish this version of the game from the versions for other platforms. "Lego Star Wars" and "Lego Star Wars II" were later compiled in "", developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. "The Complete Saga" incorporated improvements from the sequel into the original game, and expanded the Mos Eisley cantina to allow access to both games' levels. It was created for Windows, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, Xbox 360, <a href="Wii">Wii</a>, and DS. It was released on 6 November 2007.

Upon release, "Lego Star Wars II" was positively received by critics, who praised its portrayal of the films' characters and events. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" staff writer Chris Shepperd claimed that "[t]he adorable LEGO adaptations also led to some hilarious story moments: the 'I am your father' scene from <a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> is priceless". Reviewers from <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, and "" offered similar opinions. Shepperd and "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Ben Fritz called the game "adorable". In reviews of the Xbox 360 version, "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" praised the game's "off-kilter humor", and "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" stated that "[y]ou have to give credit to the brilliant blockhead who forced this awesome yet fundamentally bizarro idea on LucasArts." Jeff Bell, corporate vice president of global marketing for <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, commended "Lego Star Wars II" for expanding the range of consumers for the Xbox 360, noting its family-friendly appeal.

The game was praised as a result of reviewers' preference of the original trilogy over the prequel trilogy. Andrew Reiner of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" said that "comparing [the prequel trilogy] to the films in the original trilogy is similar to comparing <a href="Jar%20Jar%20Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a> to Han Solo". Shepperd praised the level design of "Lego Star Wars II", and called its predecessor's environments "sterile". These views were echoed by reviewers from 1UP.com, "Variety", GameSpot, GameSpy, "<a href="Official%20U.S.%20PlayStation%20Magazine">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a>" (for the PlayStation 2), and "<a href="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a>".

Critics were divided on the game's level of difficulty. Fritz claimed that, though "Lego Star Wars II" provided only a "short journey", it was "loads of fun". GameSpots Ryan Davis estimated that it could be completed in six hours, but praised its bonus content. GameSpy and 1UP.com's reviewers thought similarly. A review by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s Brett Molina claimed that "[t]he game's difficulty is balanced well enough so kids won't feel too frustrated while older gamers will still find a solid challenge" and gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10. "Official Xbox Magazine"s review praised its "weird puzzles". IGN's Jeremy Dunham and Reiner were more critical of the perceived low difficulty.

Critics disliked the game's Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions. Davis believed that the Game Boy Advance version could be completed in two hours. GameSpy staff writer Phil Theobald bemoaned this version's poor controls, easy levels and vehicle-piloting sections. He concluded that "for goodness sake, [one should] buy one of the [home] console versions". Theobald, Davis, and IGN's Craig Harris criticized the high number of glitches in the DS version.

"Lego Star Wars II" won and was nominated for numerous awards, and ranked on several video game lists. The official "Star Wars" website declared "Lego Star Wars II" to be the best "Star Wars"-related product of 2006. The game won <a href="iParenting%20Media">iParenting Media</a> Awards' "2006 Greatest Products Call", and was placed on "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>"s September 2006 "5 Things We Don't Want You to Miss" list, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the top ten video games of 2006, and GameSpy's PC "Game of the Year" list. It received the 2006 <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> award from <a href="Nick%20Jr.%20%28TV%20channel%29">Nick Jr.</a> and from IGN (for PC games only). It won <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20channel%29">Spike TV</a> Video Game Awards 2006's "Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show", and "Best Gameplay" from the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a>'s <a href="3rd%20British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">3rd British Academy Video Games Awards</a>. It received BAFTA nominations in three other categories, including "Best Game". In contrast, the previously poorly received DS version was listed as one of the "tears" on IGN's September 2009 "Cheers & Tears" list of action games for the DS. The editors of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" named "Lego Star War II" the fifth-best computer game of 2006, and called it "a superb action/adventure, one with [...] an almost puppy dog-like insistence that you love it."

"Lego Star Wars II" sold over 1.1 million copies worldwide in its opening week. The PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, and Xbox versions were the third, fifth, eighth, and ninth-best selling games of September 2006, respectively. The GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 versions were the third, eighth, and ninth-best selling games of 2006, respectively.

All platforms combined, the game was the fifth-highest selling of 2006 in the United Kingdom. The GameCube, GBA, and DS versions were the first, second, and fifth best-selling of January 2007 for their respective platforms. By 2 May 2009, the game's worldwide sales had surpassed 8.2 million. It has been certified as part of the budget lines <a href="Platinum%20Hits">Platinum Hits</a> for the Xbox 360, <a href="List%20of%20Sony%20Greatest%20Hits%20games">Greatest Hits</a> for the PlayStation 2 (each represents a worldwide sales total of at least 400,000 on its respective platform), and <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Player's Choice</a> for the GameCube (250,000).

The Chew Valley is an area in North <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, England, named after the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a>, which rises at <a href="Chewton%20Mendip">Chewton Mendip</a>, and joins the <a href="River%20Avon%2C%20Bristol">River Avon</a> at <a href="Keynsham">Keynsham</a>. Technically, the area of the valley is bounded by the <a href="water%20catchment%20area">water catchment area</a> of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas, for example, <a href="Blagdon%20Lake">Blagdon Lake</a> and its environs, which by a stricter definition are part of the <a href="Yeo%20Valley">Yeo Valley</a>. The valley is an area of rich <a href="arable%20land">arable</a> and <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy farmland</a>, interspersed with a number of villages.

The landscape consists of the valley of the River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from <a href="Dundry%20Down">Dundry Down</a> to the north, the <a href="Lulsgate%20Plateau">Lulsgate Plateau</a> to the west, the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a> to the south and the <a href="Hinton%20Blewett">Hinton Blewett</a>, <a href="Marksbury">Marksbury</a> and <a href="Newton%20St%20Loe">Newton St Loe</a> plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of <a href="escarpment">scarp slopes</a> except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create <a href="Chew%20Valley%20Lake">Chew Valley Lake</a>, which provides <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> for the nearby city of <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its <a href="nature%20conservation">nature conservation</a> interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.

The area falls into the domains of councils including <a href="Bath%20and%20North%20East%20Somerset">Bath and North East Somerset</a>, <a href="North%20Somerset">North Somerset</a> and <a href="Mendip%20District">Mendip</a>. Part of the area falls within the Mendip Hills <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. Most of the undeveloped area is within the Bristol/<a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> <a href="Green%20Belt">Green Belt</a>. Many of the villages date back to the time of the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> and there is evidence of human occupation since the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>. There are hundreds of <a href="listed%20buildings">listed buildings</a> with the churches being Grade I listed. The main commercial centre is <a href="Chew%20Magna">Chew Magna</a>.

There is no clear origin for the name "Chew", found scarcely anywhere else; however, there have been differing explanations of the <a href="etymology">etymology</a>, including "winding water", the 'ew' being a variant of the French "eau", meaning water. The word "chewer" is a western dialect for a narrow passage, and "chare" is Old English for turning. One explanation is that the name Chew began in Normandy as "Cheux", and came to England with the Norman Conquest during the eleventh century. However, others agree with Ekwall's interpretation that it is derived from the Welsh "cyw" meaning "the young of an animal, or chicken", so that "afon Cyw" would have been "the river of the chickens". Other possible explanations suggest it comes from the Old English word "ceo", 'fish gill'.

The villages in the valley have their own <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish councils</a> which have responsibility for local issues. They also elect councillors to district councils e.g. <a href="Mendip%20District">Mendip</a> and <a href="Somerset">Somerset County Council</a> or unitary authorities e.g. Bath and North East Somerset or <a href="North%20Somerset">North Somerset</a>, which have wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse and tourism.

Each of the villages is also part of a constituency, either <a href="North%20East%20Somerset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North East Somerset</a> or <a href="North%20Somerset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Somerset</a>. The area is also within the <a href="South%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South West England constituency</a> of the European Parliament. <a href="Avon%20and%20Somerset%20Constabulary">Avon and Somerset Constabulary</a> provides police services to the area.

The western end of the area (around <a href="Nempnett%20Thrubwell">Nempnett Thrubwell</a>) consists of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified <a href="clay">clay</a>, <a href="shale">shale</a> and <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Lias Limestone</a>. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous period</a>, is found in the adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic period</a>. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are <a href="Mudstone">Mudstone</a>, largely consisting of red <a href="Siltstone">Siltstone</a> resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> deposits beside the course of the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a>. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770 ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the <a href="Dundry">Dundry</a> Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the <a href="Jurassic%20period">Jurassic period</a> found on the higher ground around <a href="Maes%20Knoll">Maes Knoll</a>. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as <a href="Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) for their geological interest including <a href="Barns%20Batch%20Spinney">Barns Batch Spinney</a>, <a href="Hartcliff%20Rocks%20Quarry">Hartcliff Rocks Quarry</a> and <a href="Dundry%20Main%20Road%20South%20Quarry">Dundry Main Road South Quarry</a>.

The oldest geological formation in the valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and is represented by the <a href="Pensford">Pensford</a> Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the <a href="Somerset%20coalfield">Somerset coalfield</a>. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around <a href="Stanton%20Drew%20%28village%29">Stanton Drew</a> have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to the eastern part of the area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around <a href="Clutton%2C%20Somerset">Clutton</a> and <a href="High%20Littleton">High Littleton</a>. In the eastern area of the valley as the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a> flows through <a href="Publow">Publow</a>, <a href="Woollard">Woollard</a> and Compton Dando before joining the <a href="River%20Avon%2C%20Bristol">River Avon</a> at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.

The valley has several areas designated as <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) for biological interest, including <a href="Blagdon%20Lake">Blagdon Lake</a>, <a href="Burledge%20Hill">Burledge Hill</a>, <a href="Chew%20Valley%20Lake">Chew Valley Lake</a>, <a href="Compton%20Martin%20Ochre%20Mine">Compton Martin Ochre Mine</a>, <a href="Harptree%20Combe">Harptree Combe</a> and two sites at <a href="Folly%20Farm%2C%20Somerset">Folly Farm</a>.

The small and medium-sized fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of <a href="enclosure">enclosure</a> of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare <a href="Vicia">bithynian vetch</a> ("Vicia bithynica"). Mature <a href="oak">oak</a> ("Quercus") and <a href="Ash%20tree">ash</a> ("Fraxinus excelsior") trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of <a href="scots%20pine">scots pine</a> ("Pinus sylvestris") and <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a>s ("Castanea sativa"). <a href="Elm">Elm</a> ("Ulmus") trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.

Wildlife abounds in the valley, particularly the water birds around the rivers and lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including <a href="duck">duck</a>s, <a href="shoveller">shoveller</a> ("Anas clypeata"), <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a> ("Anas strepera") and <a href="great%20crested%20grebe">great crested grebe</a>s ("Podiceps cristatus"), a wide variety of other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as <a href="Titmouse">tits</a> (Paridae) and <a href="wren">wren</a>s (Troglodytidae) to <a href="mistle%20thrush">mistle thrush</a> (Turdidae). Larger birds include <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s (Picidae) and <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a> ("Buteo buteo").

The valley also has a wide variety of small mammals with larger species including <a href="Eurasian%20badger">Eurasian badger</a> ("Meles meles") and <a href="deer">deer</a> (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen <a href="bat">bat</a>s found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for <a href="greater%20horseshoe%20bat">greater horseshoe bat</a>s ("Rhinolophus ferrumequinum"). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the <a href="Wildlife%20and%20Countryside%20Act%201981">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a> and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 <a href="European%20Community%20Habitats%20Directive">European Community Habitats Directive</a>.

<a href="Archaeological">Archaeological</a> <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavations</a> carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as <a href="Upper%20Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic</a>, <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> and <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> (Old, Middle and New <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>), <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, comprising implements such as stone knives, <a href="flint">flint</a> blades and the head of a <a href="mace%20%28bludgeon%29">mace</a>, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the <a href="henge%20monument">henge monument</a> at <a href="Stanton%20Drew%20stone%20circles">Stanton Drew</a>, <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a> at Chewton Mendip, and <a href="Fairy%20Toot">Fairy Toot</a> <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> at <a href="Nempnett%20Thrubwell">Nempnett Thrubwell</a>. <a href="Maes%20Knoll">Maes Knoll fort</a>, on <a href="Dundry%20Down">Dundry Down</a> in the northern reaches of the valley, is a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval <a href="Wansdyke%20%28earthwork%29">Wansdyke earthworks</a>.

There is evidence of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> remains in particular a villa and burial pits. Artefacts from the valley were sent to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. Other Roman artefacts from the lake are on display at the <a href="Bristol%20City%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery</a>. There are historic parks and mansion houses, including <a href="Stanton%20Drew%20%28village%29">Stanton Drew</a>, <a href="Hunstrete">Hunstrete</a>, <a href="Stowey%23Stowey%20House">Stowey House</a>, <a href="Chew%20Magna">Chew Court</a>, <a href="Manor%20House%2C%20Chew%20Magna">Chew Magna Manor House</a> and <a href="Sutton%20Court">Sutton Court</a>. Almost all of the villages have churches dating back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century.

The area around <a href="Pensford">Pensford</a> was an important coal mining area during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when it formed part of the <a href="Somerset%20Coalfield">Somerset Coalfield</a>, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused <a href="Bristol%20and%20North%20Somerset%20Railway">Bristol and North Somerset Railway</a> runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive <a href="Pensford%20Viaduct">Pensford Viaduct</a> and on to <a href="Midsomer%20Norton">Midsomer Norton</a>. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.

The small fields in the western part of the area are particularly characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around <a href="Nempnett%20Thrubwell">Nempnett Thrubwell</a>, south of <a href="Bishop%20Sutton">Bishop Sutton</a> and west and south of <a href="Chelwood">Chelwood</a>.
Along with the rest of <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a>, the Chew Valley has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . <a href="Temperateness">Seasonal temperature variation</a> is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> high pressure affects the south-west of England, however <a href="convective">convective</a> cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by <a href="Low-pressure%20area">Atlantic depressions</a> or by <a href="convection">convection</a>. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

Many of the large houses in the valley were built or bought by wealthy merchants from Bristol and Bath who employed local people in their households. <a href="Bess%20of%20Hardwick">Bess of Hardwick</a> (1527–1606) is known to have lived in <a href="Sutton%20Court">Sutton Court</a>, <a href="Stowey">Stowey</a>, for a few years in the sixteenth century when, after the death of her first husband Sir <a href="William%20Cavendish%20%28courtier%29">William Cavendish</a>, she married Sir <a href="William%20St.%20Loe">William St. Loe</a>, who was Chief Butler of England and captain of the guard to <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, and owned several manors within the valley and surrounding areas. Around this period a close neighbour was <a href="John%20Popham%20%28Lord%20Chief%20Justice%29">Sir John Popham</a> (1533–1607) who was a judge and the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker of Parliament</a>. In the seventeenth century the eminent philosopher <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> (1632–1704) lived in <a href="Belluton">Belluton</a>; his house is still known as John Locke's cottage. In the eighteenth century the poet <a href="John%20Langhorne%20%28poet%29">John Langhorne</a> (1735–1779) became the <a href="curate">curate</a> at <a href="Blagdon">Blagdon</a> around the time that <a href="Augustus%20Montague%20Toplady">Augustus Montague Toplady</a> (1740–1778) was the priest. Geologist <a href="William%20Smith%20%28geologist%29">William Smith</a> (1769–1839) moved to the valley in 1791 to make a valuation survey of the Sutton Court estate and later worked for the <a href="Somerset%20Coal%20Canal">Somersetshire Coal Canal</a> Company.

<a href="John%20Sanger">John Sanger</a>, the circus proprietor, was born in Chew Magna in 1816. <a href="William%20Rees-Mogg">William Rees-Mogg</a>, former editor of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", took the title Baron Rees-Mogg of <a href="Hinton%20Blewett">Hinton Blewett</a> in 1988. <a href="Jazz">Jazz</a> <a href="clarinettist">clarinettist</a> <a href="Acker%20Bilk">Acker Bilk</a> lived in Pensford. <a href="Dr%20Phil%20Hammond">Dr Phil Hammond</a> and wildlife television producer <a href="Richard%20Brock">Richard Brock</a> also live in the valley. Actress <a href="Maisie%20Williams">Maisie Williams</a> is a native of Clutton.

In the past part of the population worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 Census</a> the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the <a href="Indices%20of%20deprivation%202010">Indices of deprivation 2010</a> all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.

The villages tend to have been built at the points where it was possible to cross the rivers and streams. Chew Magna is the business centre with a range of shops, banks etc. Other villages have local shops, often combined with post offices. Most villages have <a href="Public%20house">pubs</a> and <a href="village%20hall">village hall</a>s which provide the majority of the social activity.

The traditional building material is white Lias <a href="Limestone">Limestone</a>, sometimes incorporating red <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> or conglomerate, with red clay tiled roofs. Buildings, particularly the churches, date back hundreds of years, for example those at <a href="Marksbury">Marksbury</a> and <a href="Compton%20Martin">Compton Martin</a>, the latter incorporating a <a href="columbarium">columbarium</a>.

There are hundreds of <a href="listed%20buildings">listed buildings</a> in the valley. Listing refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. The authority for listing is granted by the <a href="Planning%20%28Listed%20Buildings%20and%20Conservation%20Areas%29%20Act%201990">Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990</a> and is administered by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>, an agency of the <a href="Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20%26amp%3B%20Sport">Department for Culture, Media & Sport</a>. Grade I covers buildings of exceptional interest, Grade II* particularly important buildings of special interest and Grade II buildings of special interest. Listed buildings in the valley include five churches dating back to the fourteenth century or even earlier, with grade I status: <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Andrew%2C%20Chew%20Magna">Church of St Andrew, Chew Magna</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Bartholomew%2C%20Ubley">Church of St Bartholomew, Ubley</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20St%20James%2C%20Cameley">Church of St James, Cameley</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Margaret%2C%20Hinton%20Blewett">Church of St Margaret, Hinton Blewett</a> and the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Michael%20the%20Archangel%2C%20Compton%20Martin">Church of St Michael the Archangel, Compton Martin</a>.

Trains serve <a href="Keynsham%20railway%20station">Keynsham railway station</a> on the <a href="Great%20Western%20Main%20Line">Great Western Main Line</a> and <a href="Wessex%20Main%20Line">Wessex Main Line</a> with services provided by <a href="First%20Great%20Western">First Great Western</a> and <a href="South%20West%20Trains">South West Trains</a>.

Buses also connect with <a href="Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station">Bristol Temple Meads</a>.

At the western end of the valley is the <a href="A38%20road">A38</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Airport">Bristol Airport</a>, which means parts of the valley are on the flight path. The valley is also crossed by the <a href="A37%20road">A37</a> and they are joined by the <a href="A368%20road">A368</a>. Most of the roads in the valley are small single track lanes with little traffic although a bottleneck often occurs within Chew Magna. The "Chew Valley Explorer" bus route 672/674 provides access to the villages in the valley. Cyclists can gain access via part of the <a href="Padstow">Padstow</a> to Bristol West Country Way, <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a> Route 3.

The <a href="Monarch%27s%20Way">Monarch's Way</a> long distance footpath crosses the valley.

<a href="Chew%20Valley%20School">Chew Valley School</a> is the main secondary school (11–18 years) for the valley. It is situated between Chew Magna and <a href="Chew%20Stoke">Chew Stoke</a>. The latest (2011) <a href="Office%20for%20Standards%20in%20Education">Ofsted</a> Inspection Report describes this specialist Performing Arts College as a mixed comprehensive school with 1,201 pupils on roll. The school is popular and oversubscribed with 226 students in the sixth form. The school has been successful in gaining a number of national and regional awards. There are state primary schools (4–11 years) in most of the local villages.

The local villages have football pitches and children's play areas. Gymnasium facilities, squash courts, badminton etc., and outdoor all-weather pitches are available at the Chew Valley Leisure Centre between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. There are a range of clubs and societies for young and old, including <a href="Scouting%20in%20Somerset">Scout groups</a>, gardening society, and the <a href="British%20Women%27s%20Institute">Women's institute</a>. There are areas in the valley which the <a href="Countryside%20Agency">Countryside Agency</a> has designated as access land: Burledge Hill (south of Bishop Sutton)(), Castle Earthworks (between <a href="Stowey">Stowey</a> and <a href="Bishop%20Sutton">Bishop Sutton</a>)(), <a href="Knowle%20Hill">Knowle Hill</a> (Newtown south of Chew Magna)(), Round Hill (Folly Farm)() and Shortwood Common (Litton) ().

A <a href="Bowls">Bowls</a> club is in Chew Stoke, <a href="cricket">cricket</a> pitches and teams in Chew Magna and Blagdon. There are football teams in the valley including Chew Valley Football Club and <a href="Bishop%20Sutton%20F.C.">Bishop Sutton F.C.</a>. The rugby club is based next to the leisure centre. The Bishop Sutton Tennis club is the largest in the valley, and there is also a tennis club at East Harptree. Both Chew Valley Lake and <a href="Blagdon%20Lake">Blagdon Lake</a> provide extensive fishing under permit from Bristol Water. The <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a> and most of its tributaries also have fishing but this is generally under licences to local angling clubs. Chew Valley Sailing Club is situated on Chew Valley Lake and provides dinghy sailing at all levels and hosts national and international competitions. Swimming is not allowed in the lakes and there are no swimming pools in the valley; however these are available locally in Bristol, Bath, <a href="Cheddar%2C%20Somerset">Cheddar</a> and <a href="Midsomer%20Norton">Midsomer Norton</a>.

Each October the Chew Valley Arts trail takes place in venues around the valley during which over 50 local artists display their works in such media as painting, <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a>, sculpture, <a href="Art%20glass">decorative glass</a>, <a href="pottery">pottery</a>, photography, jewellery and sugar craft. The valley and lakes have been an inspiration to artists and there is a small art gallery at Chew Valley Lake. Live music and comedy events take place in local pubs and village halls, with the village of <a href="Pensford">Pensford</a> holding a music festival every year.

Eric A. Havelock

Eric Alfred Havelock (; 3 June 1903 – 4 April 1988) was a British <a href="classics">classicist</a> who spent most of his life in Canada and the United States. He was a professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> and was active in the Canadian socialist movement during the 1930s. In the 1960s and 1970s, he served as chair of the classics departments at both <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> and <a href="Yale">Yale</a>. Although he was trained in the turn-of-the-20th-century <a href="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> tradition of classical studies, which saw <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek intellectual history</a> as an unbroken chain of related ideas, Havelock broke radically with his own teachers and proposed an entirely new model for understanding the classical world, based on a sharp division between literature of the 6th and 5th centuries BC on the one hand, and that of the 4th on the other.

Much of Havelock's work was devoted to addressing a single thesis: that all of <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western thought</a> is informed by a profound shift in the kinds of ideas available to the human mind at the point that <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophy</a> converted from an <a href="Oral%20tradition">oral</a> to a <a href="literacy">literate</a> form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and <a href="Walter%20J.%20Ong">Walter J. Ong</a> (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from <a href="orality">orality</a> to literacy, and Havelock has been one of the most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of <a href="Harold%20Innis">Harold Innis</a> and <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.

Born in London on 3 June 1903, Havelock grew up in Scotland where he attended <a href="Greenock%20Academy">Greenock Academy</a> before
enrolment at <a href="The%20Leys%20School">The Leys School</a> in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, England, at the age of 14. He studied there with <a href="William%20Henry%20Balgarnie">W. H. Balgarnie</a>, a classicist to whom Havelock gives considerable credit. In 1922, Havelock started at <a href="Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a>.

While studying under <a href="F.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Cornford">F. M. Cornford</a> at Cambridge, Havelock began to question the received wisdom about the nature of <a href="pre-Socratic%20philosophy">pre-Socratic philosophy</a> and, in particular, about its relationship with <a href="Socrates">Socratic thought</a>. In "The Literate Revolution in Greece", his penultimate book, Havelock recalls being struck by a discrepancy between the language used by the philosophers he was studying and the heavily <a href="Plato">Plato</a>nic idiom with which it was interpreted in the standard texts. It was well known that some of these philosophical texts (Parmenides, Empedocles) were written not only in verse but in the metre of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, who had recently been identified (still controversially at the time) by <a href="Milman%20Parry">Milman Parry</a> as an <a href="oral%20poetry">oral poet</a>, but Cornford and other scholars of these early philosophers saw the practice as a fairly insignificant convention left over from <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>. Havelock eventually came to the conclusion that the poetic aspects of early philosophy "were matters not of style but of substance," and that such thinkers as <a href="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> and <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> actually have more in common even on an intellectual level with Homer than they do with Plato and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. However, he did not publicly break from Cornford until many years later.

In 1926 Havelock took his first academic job at <a href="Acadia%20University">Acadia University</a> in Nova Scotia, Canada. He married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, and moved on to <a href="Victoria%20University%20in%20the%20University%20of%20Toronto">Victoria College</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> in 1929. Havelock's scholarly work during this period focused on <a href="Latin%20poetry">Latin poetry</a>, particularly <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a>, far from the early Greek philosophy he had worked on at Cambridge. While in Canada Havelock became increasingly involved in <a href="politics%20of%20Canada">politics</a>. With his fellow academics <a href="Frank%20Underhill">Frank Underhill</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Forsey">Eugene Forsey</a>, Havelock was a cofounder of the <a href="League%20for%20Social%20Reconstruction">League for Social Reconstruction</a>, an organisation of politically active socialist intellectuals. He and Underhill were also the most outspoken of a group of dissident faculty members at the University.

Havelock's political engagement deepened rapidly. In 1931, after <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> police had blocked a public meeting by an organisation the police claimed was associated with communists, he and Underhill wrote a public letter of protest, calling the action "short-sighted, inexpedient, and intolerable." The letter led to considerable tension between the leadership of the university and the activist professors led by Havelock and Underhill, as well as a sharply critical public reaction. All of the major newspapers in Toronto, along with a number of prominent business leaders, denounced the professors as radical leftists and their behaviour as unbecoming of academics.

Though the League for Social Reconstruction began as more of a discussion group than a political party, it became a force in Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a>, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.

While at Toronto, Havelock began formulating his theory of orality and literacy, establishing the context of a later movement at the University interested in the critical study of communication, which Donald F. Theall has called the "Toronto School of Communications". Havelock's work was complemented by that of <a href="Harold%20Innis">Harold Innis</a>, who was working on the history of <a href="Media%20studies">media</a>. The work Havelock and Innis began in the 1930s was the preliminary basis for the influential theories of communication developed by <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Snow%20Carpenter">Edmund Snow Carpenter</a> in the 1950s.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Havelock moved away from the socialist organisations he had been associated with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the <a href="Ontario%20Classical%20Association">Ontario Classical Association</a>. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, which had just been liberated from <a href="Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece%20during%20World%20War%20II">Nazi control</a>. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.

At the same time that he was becoming increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> and <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> as well as <a href="Plato">Plato</a> himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with <a href="John%20Burnet%20%28classicist%29">John Burnet</a>, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the <a href="theory%20of%20forms">theory of forms</a> originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the <a href="Athens">Athens</a> of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.

In 1947, Havelock moved to <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, to take a position at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, where he remained until 1963. He was active in a number of aspects of the University and of the department, of which he became chair; he undertook a translation of and commentary on <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' "<a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>" for the benefit of his students. He published this translation, with an extended commentary on <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a> and the myth's implications for history, under the title "The Crucifixion of Intellectual Man" (and then changed it back to "Prometheus" when the book was republished in the 1960s, saying that the earlier title had "come to seem a bit pretentious"). During this time he began his first major attempt to argue for a division between Platonic or Aristotelian philosophy and what came before. His focus was on <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> and, in particular, the beginnings of Greek liberalism as introduced by <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>. In his book "The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics", he argued that for Democritus and the liberals, political theory was based on an understanding of "the behaviour of man in a cosmic and historical setting": that is, humanity defined as the poets would define it—measured through its individual actions. Plato and Aristotle were interested in the nature of humanity and, in particular, the idea that human actions might be rooted in inherent qualities rather than consisting of individual choices.

In arguing for a basic <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a> split between Plato and the contemporaries of Democritus, Havelock was directly contradicting a very long tradition in philosophy that had painstakingly assembled innumerable connections between Plato and the pre-Socratics, to reinforce the position that Plato, as his own dialogues imply, was primarily informed by his teacher Socrates, and that Socrates in turn was a willing participant in a philosophical conversation already several hundred years old (again, with a seeming endorsement from Plato, who shows a young Socrates conversing with and learning from the pre-Socratics <a href="Parmenides">Parmenides</a> and <a href="Zeno%20of%20Elea">Zeno</a> in his dialogue the "<a href="Parmenides%20%28dialogue%29">Parmenides</a>"—a historical impossibility that might represent figuratively an intellectual rather than direct conversation). The book was intriguing to many philosophers but was poorly received among some classicists, with one reviewer calling Havelock's argument for basic difference between Plato and the pre-Socratics "a failure" and his analysis of Plato and Aristotle "distortion." Some problems have persisted in research of Greek literacy, and in the main, the interest in continuing the line of research has been sustained in recent works.

"The Liberal Temper" makes the argument for the division between Plato and early Greek philosophy without a fully realised account of Havelock's theory of Greek literacy, which he was still developing throughout this period. Rather than attempting once again to explain his distinction between 5th- and 4th-century BC thought in terms of a dissection of the earlier school, Havelock turned, in his 1963 "Preface to Plato", to 4th-century BC philosophy itself. He was interested principally in Plato's much debated rejection of poetry in the "<a href="Republic%20%28dialogue%29">Republic</a>", in which his fictionalised Socrates argues that poetic <a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>—the representation of life in art—is bad for the soul. Havelock's claim was that the "Republic" can be used to understand the position of poetry in the "history of the Greek mind." The book is divided into two parts, the first an exploration of <a href="orality">oral culture</a> (and what Havelock thinks of as oral thought), and the second an argument for what Havelock calls "The Necessity of Platonism" (the title of Part 2): the intimate relationship between Platonic thought and the development of literacy. Instead of concentrating on the philosophical definitions of key terms, as he had in his book on Democritus, Havelock turned to the Greek language itself, arguing that the meaning of words changed after the full development of written literature to admit a self-reflective subject; even <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s, he said, had different functions. The result was a universal shift in what the Greek mind could imagine:

We confront here a change in the Greek language and in the syntax of linguistic usage and in the overtones of certain key words which is part of a larger intellectual revolution, which affected the whole range of the Greek cultural experience ... Our present business is to connect this discovery with that crisis in Greek culture which saw the replacement of an orally memorised tradition by a quite different system of instruction and education, and which therefore saw the Homeric state of mind give way to the Platonic.

For Havelock, Plato's rejection of poetry was merely the realisation of a cultural shift in which he was a participant.

Two distinct phenomena are covered by the shift he observed in Greek culture at the end of the 5th century: the content of thought (in particular the concept of man or of the soul), and the organisation of thought. In Homer, Havelock argues, the order of ideas is associative and temporal. The epic's "units of meaning ... are linked associatively to form an episode, but the parts of the episode are greater than the whole." For Plato, on the other hand, the purpose of thought is to arrive at the significance of the whole, to move from the specific to the general. Havelock points out that Plato's <a href="syntax">syntax</a>, which he shares with other 4th-century writers, reflects that organisation, making smaller ideas subordinate to bigger ideas. Thus, the Platonic <a href="theory%20of%20forms">theory of forms</a> in itself, Havelock claims, derives from a shift in the organisation of the Greek language, and ultimately comes down to a different function for and conception of the <a href="noun">noun</a>.

"Preface to Plato" had a profound impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek <a href="philology">philology</a>; the book also acknowledges the influence of <a href="literary%20theory">literary theory</a>, particularly <a href="structuralism">structuralism</a>. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to "Preface" from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as <a href="psychology">psychology</a> and <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>.

There have been affirmations and criticism of Havelock's methods. His account of orality is based almost entirely on Homer, but the history of the Homeric text is not known, which forces Havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested. The works of <a href="Milman%20Parry">Milman Parry</a> on Homer were instrumental in developing the orientation to his work, and the breakthrough sustained research which Havelock prepared. The "Parry-Lord thesis" was introduced by Rosalind Thomas, to clarify the import of this approach. Some later classicists argue that the poetic nature of Homer's language works against the very arguments Havelock makes about the intellectual nature of oral poetry. What he asserts as a definitive use of language can never be conclusively demonstrated not to be an accident of "metrical convenience." Homerists, like Platonists, found the book to be less than useful for the precise work of their own discipline; many classicists rejected outright Havelock's essential thesis that oral culture predominated through the 5th century. At the same time, though, Havelock's influence, particularly in literary theory, was growing enormously. He is the most cited writer in Walter J. Ong's influential "Orality and Literacy" other than Ong himself. His work has been cited in studies of orality and literacy in African culture and the implications of modern literacy theory for <a href="library%20science">library science</a>. "Preface to Plato" has remained continuously in print since its initial publication.

Shortly after publication of "Preface to Plato", Havelock accepted a position as chair of the Classics Department at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. He remained in <a href="New%20Haven">New Haven</a> for eight years, and then taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the <a href="University%20at%20Buffalo%2C%20The%20State%20University%20of%20New%20York">State University of New York at Buffalo</a>. He retired in 1973 and moved to <a href="Poughkeepsie%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie, New York</a>, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a>. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of "Preface to Plato" to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.

Increasingly central to Havelock's account of Greek culture in general was his conception of the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> as a unique entity. He wrote in 1977:

The invention of the Greek alphabet, as opposed to all previous systems, including the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician</a>, constituted an event in the history of human culture, the importance of which has not as yet been fully grasped. Its appearance divides all pre-Greek civilisations from those that are post-Greek.
But his philological concerns now were only a small part of a much larger project to make sense of the nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a <a href="literary%20theory">theoretical</a> sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the <a href="Dipylon%20inscription">Dipylon inscription</a>, a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to change the nature of human culture." It is this larger point about the differences between oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. <a href="Walter%20J.%20Ong">Walter J. Ong</a>, for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing. These ideas were sketched out in "Preface to Plato" but became central to Havelock's work from "Prologue to Greek Literacy" (1971) onward.

In the latter part of his career, Havelock's relentless pursuit of his unvarying thesis led to a lack of interest in addressing opposing viewpoints. In a review of Havelock's "The Greek Concept of Justice", a book that attempts to ascribe the most significant ideas in Greek philosophy to his linguistic research, the philosopher <a href="Alasdair%20MacIntyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> accuses Havelock of a "brusque refusal to recognize the substance of the case he has to defeat." As a result of this refusal, Havelock seems to have been caught in a conflict of mere contradiction with his opponents, in which without attempt at refutation, he simply asserts repeatedly that philosophy is fundamentally literate in nature, and is countered only with a reminder that, as MacIntyre says, "Socrates wrote no books."

In his last public lecture, which was published posthumously, Havelock addressed the political implications of his own scholarly work. Delivered at Harvard on 16 March 1988, less than three weeks before his death, the lecture is framed principally in opposition to the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> philosopher <a href="Leo%20Strauss">Leo Strauss</a>. Strauss had published a detailed and extensive critique of Havelock's "The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics" in March 1959, as "The Liberalism of Classical Political Philosophy" in the journal "Review of Metaphysics." (Strauss died 14 years later in 1973, the same year in which Havelock retired.) Havelock's 1988 lecture claims to contain a systematic account of Plato's politics; Havelock argues that Plato's idealism applies a mathematical strictness to politics, countering his old teacher Cornford's assertion that Platonic arguments that morality must be analyzable in arithmetical terms cannot be serious. This way of thinking about politics, Havelock concluded, could not be used as a model for understanding or shaping inherently nonmathematical interactions: "The stuff of human politics is conflict and compromise."

John Brooke-Little

John Philip Brook Brooke-Little, (6 April 1927 – 13 February 2006) was an influential and popular English writer on <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> subjects, and a long-serving <a href="herald">herald</a> at the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in London. In 1947, while still a student, Brooke-Little founded the Society of Heraldic Antiquaries, now known as the <a href="The%20Heraldry%20Society">Heraldry Society</a> and recognised as one of the leading learned societies in its field. He served as the society's chairman for 50 years and then as its President from 1997 until his death in 2006. In addition to the foundation of this group, Brooke-Little was involved in other heraldic groups and societies and worked for many years as an officer of arms; beginning as <a href="Bluemantle%20Pursuivant">Bluemantle Pursuivant</a>, Brooke-Little rose to the second highest heraldic office in England: <a href="Clarenceux%20King%20of%20Arms">Clarenceux King of Arms</a>.

John Brooke-Little was born in <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. His mother, <a href="Constance%20Egan">Constance Egan</a>, was the author of many children's stories including the "<a href="Epaminondas%20and%20His%20Auntie">Epaminondas</a>" books and the adventures of "Jummy the Baby Elephant". In the 1920s, Egan was the editor of "Home Chat". This helped to prepare her for future editorial duties with the Heraldry Society's journal, the "Coat of Arms" in the 1950s. She was the second wife of Raymond Brooke-Little, who worked as an <a href="electrical%20engineer">electrical engineer</a>. His paternal ancestors, the Littles, came from <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and may be traced in the parish registers of <a href="Biddestone">Biddestone</a> back to the late seventeenth century. A <a href="Pedigree%20chart">pedigree</a> of his family appears in the 1972 edition of "Burke's Landed Gentry" under the heading "Brooke-Little of Heyford House". Brooke-Little was educated at <a href="Clayesmore%20School">Clayesmore School</a>, a progressive co-educational <a href="Public%20school%20%28UK%29">public school</a> in Dorset. The school remained an important part of Brooke-Little's life, and he later sent his own children there. He oversaw the process of granting arms to the school while serving as chairman of its <a href="board%20of%20governors">board of governors</a> from 1971 to 1983.

As a boy, Brooke-Little's first contact with the College of Arms came when he went to see <a href="Algar%20Howard">Sir Algar Howard</a>, then <a href="Garter%20Principal%20King%20of%20Arms">Garter Principal King of Arms</a>. Howard was the head of the corporation of heralds at the College of Arms, and encouraged Brooke-Little's budding interest in the subject of heraldry. While still a student, he founded a heraldry society with his friends. Brooke-Little went to <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> in 1949 and read history. His college friends included <a href="Alexander%20Colin%20Cole">Colin Cole</a>, later Garter King of Arms, with whom he refounded the dormant Oxford University Heraldry Society. The two men refounded it a second time in 1958. The Society was refounded in 1978, and again in 2005 and currently holds one lecture per term.

Brooke-Little married Mary Pierce, daughter of John Raymond Pierce, in 1960. The couple had three sons, Philip, Leo, and Merlin, and one daughter, Clare. In 2004, after having retired from the College of Arms, Brooke-Little lived at his Heyford House in Oxfordshire with the families of both Leo and Merlin.

Brooke-Little had a major stroke in 1994. This incident left his mobility and speech partly impaired, though his mind was still quite sharp. He continued in his heraldic duties until his retirement three years later. He also continued to guide the Heraldry Society after this. He suffered a succession of minor strokes over his last years as a herald and during his retirement. He was still able to make appearances at functions of the Heraldry Society, though his role was severely limited by debilitating <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>. It was a short series of several of these small strokes in quick succession which led to Brooke-Little's death on 13 February 2006 in <a href="Banbury">Banbury</a>, Oxfordshire, at the age of 78. He was one of the last surviving officers of arms to serve at the <a href="Coronation">Coronation</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The funeral took place on 23 February 2006, and the eulogy was delivered by <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Paston-Bedingfeld%2C%2010th%20Baronet">Sir Henry Paston-Bedingfeld</a>, <a href="York%20Herald">York Herald</a>.

In 1952–3, Brooke-Little served on the staff assembled by the <a href="Bernard%20Fitzalan-Howard%2C%2016th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Earl Marshal</a> to plan the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was appointed a Gold Staff Officer for the Coronation and held a key co-ordination role during planning as well as on the day. It was his abiding interest in heraldry that led to this appointment, and this work with the Earl Marshal and the officers of arms led to his first heraldic appointment. He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956. The rank of <a href="pursuivant">pursuivant</a> is the junior of the three levels an officer of arms can attain, and Brooke-Little related the story of his appointment in an editorial. In 1956, <a href="George%20Bellew">Sir George Bellew</a>, the Garter King of Arms, had recommended Brooke-Little and Colin Cole for the open position of Bluemantle. The two were asked to meet with the Earl Marshal in London. The Earl Marshal was not usually faced with two candidates for an opening; he offered the position to Cole, who turned it down as his wife was expecting a child. Brooke-Little was made Bluemantle. Several months later when <a href="Gerald%20Wollaston">Sir Gerald Wollaston</a> died, in the ensuing shuffle Cole was finally given his appointment as <a href="Portcullis%20Pursuivant">Portcullis Pursuivant</a>.

In 1967, Brooke-Little was advanced to the position of <a href="Richmond%20Herald">Richmond Herald</a>. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace <a href="Walter%20Verco">Sir Walter Verco</a> as <a href="Norroy%20and%20Ulster%20King%20of%20Arms">Norroy and Ulster King of Arms</a>, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the <a href="River%20Trent">Trent</a>, as well as in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Patrick">Order of Saint Patrick</a> was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained "ex officio" an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.

Brooke-Little maintained an interest in Irish heraldry even after he was promoted from Norroy and Ulster to Clarenceux. After the Director of the National Library of Ireland was made the Chief Herald of Ireland, Brooke-Little wrote to the "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" of the importance of maintaining a strong tradition of heraldic and genealogical expertise in the Irish Office of Arms.

When Sir Colin Cole retired from the office of Garter King of Arms in 1992, Brooke-Little was a leading candidate to replace him. This is the highest heraldic office in England; Garter is chairman of the Chapter of the College of Arms, as well as the King of Arms of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>. Due to his convivial life style, though, Brooke-Little was not well suited to the managerial responsibilities of the office of Garter. Instead, the honour went to <a href="Conrad%20Swan">Sir Conrad Swan</a>. On 19 June 1995, Brooke-Little was appointed to the office of Clarenceux King of Arms following the death of <a href="Anthony%20Wagner">Sir Anthony Wagner</a>. This is the senior of the two provincial Kings of Arms and the holder of the office has jurisdiction over England and Wales south of the Trent. The heralds had traditionally been appointed "for life on good behaviour", but Brooke-Little became Clarenceux shortly after compulsory retirement at age 70 was introduced, and he had to leave after only two years in this post. He ended his heraldic career without ever having attained the office of Garter King of Arms, or being honoured with a knighthood.

In addition to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature can be found on the reverse of the <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the <a href="Heralds%27%20Museum">Heralds' Museum</a> at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of heraldry.

In 1952, as John Brooke-Little was entering the world of heraldry as a Gold Staff Officer, he began exploring the origins of his own arms. His family had been using the arms "Azure, six lioncels rampant gules", but some research proved that the Brooke-Littles had no right to these arms. John worked to apply for a grant on behalf of his father. When asked for input, his father noted that the lions previously used were improper and that he thought <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a>s would be a good replacement. Red "<a href="goutte">goutte</a>s" (droplets) alluded to the family's former holding of the Manor of <a href="Slaughterford">Slaughterford</a>. The arms were granted to Raymond Brooke-Little on 5 March 1952. John quartered these arms with those of his mother, Constance Egan. The whole shield of arms is blazoned "Quarterly: I and IV, argent, goutté de sang three unicorns' heads erased sable armed and crined or langued azure (Brooke-Little); II and III, azure, two dolphins haurient and addorsed or, the eyes gules, between four shamrocks slipped or". The crest is blazoned "a demi-unicorn rampant erased sable, armed, crined and unguled or, langued azure and collared gobony or and gules, with a chain or reflexed over the back and attached with a ring or". At the same time, the motto of "Recte Aut Nil" (meaning 'correctly or not at all') was granted, as well as John Brooke-Little's well-used <a href="Heraldic%20badge">badge</a>, blazoned "a <a href="triquetra">triquetra</a> or interlaced by an <a href="Annulet%20%28heraldry%29">annulet</a> argent".

In 1947, a twenty-year-old Brooke-Little founded the Society of Heraldic Antiquaries, which was renamed the Heraldry Society in 1950. It was <a href="incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporated</a> in 1956 and is now a registered charity. The principal object of the society is to extend interest in and knowledge of heraldry, <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a>, precedence, and related disciplines. Brooke-Little served its chairman for fifty years. In 1997, as he was ending his career as an officer of arms, he changed roles in the Society to become its president. He served in this role until his death. Brooke-Little also served as the Honorary Editor of the society's scholarly journal, the "Coat of Arms". From the first publication of the journal until the middle of 1965, his mother, Constance Egan, served as the managing editor of the "Coat of Arms", though Brooke-Little always had a guiding influence on the publication. It was not until 2005 that Brooke-Little finally handed complete control of the journal to two young heralds: <a href="Peter%20O%27Donaghue">Peter O'Donaghue</a>, Bluemantle Pursuivant, and <a href="Clive%20Cheesman">Clive Cheesman</a>, <a href="Rouge%20Dragon%20Pursuivant">Rouge Dragon Pursuivant</a>.

Brooke-Little was integral to the foundation of the White Lion Society. In 1984, at a meeting of the Heraldry Society, it was suggested to Brooke-Little, then Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, that it would be appropriate to found a "Society of Friends" of the College of Arms. Brooke-Little explained that the late <a href="Wilfrid%20Scott-Giles">Wilfrid Scott-Giles</a>, <a href="Fitzalan%20Pursuivant%20Extraordinary">Fitzalan Pursuivant</a>, had previously suggested the same idea, proposing the name of the 'White Lion Society' after the heraldic <a href="supporters">supporters</a> of the College of Arms, which are two white lions (alluding to the supporters of the <a href="House%20of%20Mowbray">Mowbray</a> arms which the Earl Marshal inherited from his ancestors). Brooke-Little put the idea before the Chapter of the College shortly after and with its approval, the Society came into being in 1986.

Brooke-Little garnered many honours and awards during his time of service to the Crown. He was appointed a 4th Class Member of the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Royal Victorian Order</a> (an honour now known as Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order) in 1969 for his services at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. This was followed by a promotion to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order at the 1984 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> Though most Kings of Arms up to that time were knighted, that honour was never given to him. The closest that he came was in 1975 when he was made a Knight of Justice of the <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem</a>, the British revival of the ancient <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller of Saint John</a>.

Brooke-Little was an Honorary Fellow of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Heraldic%20and%20Genealogical%20Studies">Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies</a> and a Chevalier of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Fleur%20de%20Lys">Order of the Fleur de Lys</a>. He was Master of the <a href="Scriveners%27%20Company">Scriveners' Company</a> from 1985 until 1986, Chairman of the <a href="Harleian%20Society">Harleian Society</a>, and President of the English Language Literary Trust for eleven years from 1985 until 1996. His heraldic involvement carried over as a <a href="trustee">trustee</a> of the Royal Air Force Heraldry Trust and an adviser on heraldry to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> from 1983 until his death.

In addition to his honours in Britain, Brooke-Little also served as <a href="Chancellor">Chancellor</a> of the British Association of the <a href="Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta">Sovereign Military Order of Malta</a> from 1973 to 1977. He was first admitted to the Order as a Knight of Magistral Grace, and would eventually hold the rank of Knight Grand Cross of Grace and Devotion. He was also honoured with the <a href="Order%20of%20Merito%20Melitense">Order of Merito Melitense</a> in 1964 and was made a Knight Grand Cross of Grace of the <a href="Sacred%20Military%20Constantinian%20Order%20of%20Saint%20George">Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George</a>. In addition to these honours, he held the Cruz Distinguida (1st class) de San Raimundo de Penafort.

Brooke-Little was the author or editor of at least ten books including:

Barber coinage

The Barber coinage consists of a <a href="Dime%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">dime</a>, <a href="Quarter%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">quarter</a>, and <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">half dollar</a> designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>. They were minted between 1892 and 1916, though no half dollars were struck in the final year of the series.

By the late 1880s, there were increasing calls for the replacement of the <a href="United%20States%20Seated%20Liberty%20coinage">Seated Liberty design</a>, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="Edward%20O.%20Leech">Edward O. Leech</a>, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.

Public and artistic opinion of the new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint officials began plans to replace them once the design's minimum term expired in 1916. The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand, but before the end of the year, the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a>, <a href="Standing%20Liberty%20quarter">Standing Liberty quarter</a>, and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a> had begun production. Most dates in the Barber coin series are not difficult to obtain, but the 1894 dime struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> (<a href="1894-S%20Barber%20dime">1894-S</a>), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.

Charles E. Barber was born in London in 1840. His grandfather, John Barber, led the family to America in the early 1850s. Both John and his son <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William</a> were engravers and Charles followed in their footsteps. The Barber family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States, though they later moved to Providence to allow William to work for the <a href="Gorham%20Manufacturing%20Company">Gorham Manufacturing Company</a>. William Barber's skills came to the attention of Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, who hired him as an assistant engraver in 1865; when Longacre died in 1869, William Barber became chief engraver and Charles was hired as an assistant engraver.

William Barber died on August 31, 1879, of an illness contracted after swimming at <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>. His son applied for the position of chief engraver, as did <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, another British-born engraver hired by the Mint. In early December 1879, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, Mint Director <a href="Horatio%20Burchard">Horatio Burchard</a>, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a> met to determine the issue. They decided to recommend the appointment of Barber, who was subsequently nominated by President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> and in February 1880, was confirmed by the Senate. Barber would serve nine presidents in the position, remaining until his death in 1917, when Morgan would succeed him.

Coinage redesign was being considered during Barber's early years as chief engraver. Superintendent Snowden believed that the base-metal coins then being struck (the one-, three-, and five-cent pieces) should have uniform designs, as did many of the silver pieces, and also some gold coins. He had Barber create experimental <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s. In spite of Snowden's desires, the only design modified was that of the five-cent coin, or <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>; Barber's design, known as the <a href="Liberty%20Head%20nickel">Liberty Head nickel</a>, entered production in 1883. The new coin had its denomination designated by a Roman numeral "V" on the reverse; the three-cent coin had always had a "III" to designate its denomination. Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the nickel and <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a> (or five-dollar gold piece) were close in size, and plated the <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a> coins to pass to the unwary. Amid public ridicule of the Mint, production came to a halt until Barber hastily added the word "cents" to the reverse of his design.

For much of the second half of the 19th century, most U.S. silver coins bore <a href="United%20States%20Seated%20Liberty%20coinage">a design</a> of a seated <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>. This design had been created by <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>, an engraver at the United States Mint in Philadelphia, after a sketch by artist <a href="Thomas%20Sully">Thomas Sully</a>, and introduced to U.S. coins in the late 1830s. The design reflected an English influence, and as artistic tastes changed over time, was increasingly disliked in the United States. In 1876, "<a href="The%20Galaxy%20%28magazine%29">The Galaxy</a>" magazine said of the then current silver coins:

Public dissatisfaction with the newly-issued <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a> led the Mint's engravers to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor <a href="Richard%20Watson%20Gilder">Richard Watson Gilder</a> of "<a href="The%20Century%20Illustrated%20Monthly%20Magazine">The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</a>". Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along with one of his reporters and sculptor <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.

In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint director by <a href="James%20Kimball">James Kimball</a>. The new director was more receptive to Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator <a href="Justin%20Morrill">Justin Morrill</a> questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and had in the past introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890, that President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.

Three days before the signing of the 1890 act, Barber wrote to the superintendent of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Bosbyshell">Oliver Bosbyshell</a>, setting forth proposed terms of a competition to select new coin designs. Barber suggested that entrants be required to submit models, as opposed to drawings, and that the designs be in low relief, which was used for coins. He proposed that the entries include the lettering and denomination, as submissions without them would not adequately show the appearance of the finished coin. He received a reply that due to other work, the Mint would not be able to address the question until the spring of 1891.

On October 16, 1890, a new Mint director, <a href="Edward%20O.%20Leech">Edward O. Leech</a>, took office. Leech, aged 38 at the time, had spent his career at the Bureau of the Mint, and was an enthusiastic supporter of redesign. He took the precaution of obtaining recommendations from Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition. Since most of the proposed artists were New York-based, Andrew Mason, superintendent of the New York <a href="Assay%20Office">Assay Office</a>, was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees. Leading Mason's list of ten names was that of Saint-Gaudens. Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3, 1891; the following day, the Mint director announced the competition, open to the public, but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate. Besides Saint-Gaudens, artists asked to compete included <a href="Daniel%20Chester%20French">Daniel Chester French</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Adams%20%28sculptor%29">Herbert Adams</a> and <a href="Kenyon%20Cox">Kenyon Cox</a>. Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation, Leech offered a $500 prize to the winner, and no payments to anyone else. He sought new designs for both sides of the dollar, and for the obverses of the half dollar, quarter, and dime—Leech was content to let the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue. By law, an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime.

Most of the artists conferred in New York and responded in a joint letter that they would be willing to participate, but not on the terms set. They proposed a competition with set fees for sketches and designs submitted by the invited artists, to be judged by a jury of their peers, and with the Mint committed to replace the Seated Liberty coins with the result. They also insisted that the same artist create both sides of a given coin, and that more time be given to allow the development of designs. Leech was unable to meet these terms, as there was only enough money available for the single prize. In addition to inviting the ten artists, he had sent thousands of solicitations through the country; a number of designs were submitted in response to the circulars. To judge the submissions, he appointed a jury consisting of Saint-Gaudens, Barber, and Henry Mitchell, a Boston seal engraver and member of the 1890 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The committee met in June 1891 and quickly rejected all entries.

Leech was quoted in the press regarding the result of the contest:

Barber wrote years later about the competition, "many [entries] were sent in, but Mr. St. Gaudens, who was appointed one of the committee to pass upon designs, objected to everything submitted". Numismatic historian Roger Burdette explained the artistic differences between the two men:

Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 instructed Barber to prepare designs for the half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was to be done at the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.

Leech announced the decision to have Barber do the work in July, stating that he had instructed the engraver to prepare designs for presentation to Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Charles%20Foster%20%28Ohio%20politician%29">Charles Foster</a>. In a letter printed in the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>", Gilder expressed disappointment that the Mint was planning to generate the new designs in-house, feeling that the Mint, essentially a factory for coins, was ill-equipped to generate artistic coin designs. Due to Gilder's prominence in the coinage redesign movement, Leech felt the need to respond personally, which he did in early August. He told Gilder that "artistic designs for coins, that would meet the ideas of an art critic like yourself, and artists generally, are not always adapted for practical coining". He assured Gilder that the designs which Barber had already prepared had met with the approval of Mitchell, though Leech himself had some improvements to suggest to the chief engraver.

Barber's first attempt, modeled for the half dollar, disregarded Leech's instructions. Instead of a design based on French coinage, it depicted a standing figure of <a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>, bearing a "<a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">pileus</a>" atop a liberty pole; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her. The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a>, enclosed inside a thick oak wreath, with the required legends surrounding the rim. Leech rejected the design, and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid-September with a head of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin. Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster; on September 28, he wrote Barber that Liberty's lips were "rather voluptuous" and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath. Barber did so, and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck. Barber complained, in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell, but intended for Leech, that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time. Leech replied, stating that he did not care how much effort was expended in order to improve the design, especially since, once issued, they would have to be used for 25 years. Barber's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with a cover letter from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb (Bosbyshell was traveling) stating that Barber "disclaims any intention to be captious and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage". The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements, and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences; the overall tone was argumentative. Leech chose not to write again; he addressed one concern, about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately, by visiting the <a href="United%20States%20Botanic%20Garden">National Botanical Garden</a>, obtaining one, and sending it to Barber.

The question of how to render the stars (representing the 13 original states) on the coin was posed in the letters; in the end, Leech opted for six-pointed stars on the obverse and five-pointed ones on the reverse. Barber had prepared three versions of the design, each with clouds over the eagle; Leech approved one on October 31 and ordered working dies prepared, but then began to question the presence of the clouds, and had two more versions made. On November 6, President Harrison and his Cabinet considered which of the designs to approve, and chose one without the clouds; the following day, Leech ordered working dies prepared. Barber scaled down his design for the quarter and dime. While the Cabinet approved the designs, members requested that the Mint embolden the words "Liberty" on the obverse and "E Pluribus Unum" on the reverse, believing that these legends would wear away in circulation; despite the resulting changes, this proved to be accurate. For the reverse of the dime, on which, by law, an eagle could not appear, a slight modification of the reverse of the Seated Liberty dime was used, with a wreath of foliage and produce surrounding the words "One Dime".

It is uncertain when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, but this was most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a> and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00 a.m. By the end of the day, all three denominations had been coined.

All three denominations of the Barber coinage depict a head of Liberty, facing right. She wears a "pileus", a crown fashioned from an olive branch, and a small headband inscribed "Liberty". On the quarter and half dollar, the motto "In God We Trust" appears above her head; she is otherwise surrounded with 13 six-pointed stars and the date. On the dime, her head is surrounded with "United States of America" and the year. The reverse of the quarter and the half dollar depicts a <a href="Spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic eagle</a>, based on the Great Seal. The bird holds in its mouth a scroll inscribed "<a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>" and in its right claws an olive branch; in its left it holds 13 arrows. Above the eagle are 13 five-pointed stars; it is surrounded by the name of the country and by the coin's denomination. The reverse of the dime depicts a wreath of corn, wheat, maple and oak leaves surrounding the words "One Dime". Barber's monogram "B" is on the cutoff of Liberty's neck; the mint mark, on the dime, is placed beneath the wreath on the reverse and beneath the eagle on the larger denominations.

Barber's head of Liberty is purely classical, and is rendered in the Roman style. The head is modeled after the French "<a href="Ceres%20%28French%20coins%29">Ceres</a>" silver coinage of the late 19th century, but bears a resemblance to Morgan's design for the silver dollar. This did not escape numismatist <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> in his comprehensive guide to U.S. coins: "Barber must have been feeling unusually lazy. He left the [dime] rev[erse] design as it had been since 1860, with minor simplifications. His obv[erse] was a mirror image of the Morgan dollar head, with much of Miss <a href="Anna%20Willess%20Williams">Anna Willess Williams</a>'s back hair cropped off, the rest concealed ... within a disproportionately large cap." In his text introducing the Barber quarter, Breen states, "the whole composition is Germanically stolid, prosy, crowded (especially on rev[erse]), and without discernible merit aside from the technical one of low relief". Burdette terms Barber's designs, "typically mediocre imitations of the current French-style—hardly better than the arcane seated Liberty type they replaced".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his work on U.S. coins, took a more positive view of Barber's coinage: "the last word as to their aesthetic merits has yet to be written. Little admired or collected for more than three generations after their appearance [writing in 1971], these essentially conservative but most dignified coins have suddenly become extremely popular with collectors". Vermeule argued that "the designs of Barber's coins were more attuned to the times than he perhaps realized. The plumpish, matronly "gravitas" of Liberty had come to America seven years earlier in the person of <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bartholdi">Frédéric Bartholdi</a>'s giant statue [the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>] ... " He suggested that the features of <a href="Daniel%20Chester%20French">Daniel Chester French</a>'s huge statue "<a href="Statue%20of%20the%20Republic">Republic</a>", created for the <a href="World%20Columbian%20Exposition">World Columbian Exposition</a>, "were absolutely in harmony with what Charles Barber had created for the coinage in the year of the Fair's opening".

Leech released the new designs to the press about November 10, 1891. According to numismatist David Lange, the new coinage received mixed reviews: "while the general press and public seemed satisfied with the new dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar, numismatists were either mildly disappointed with the new coins or remained silent on the matter." Moran records a number of unfavorable reviews, without listing any favorable ones. Vermeule stated that "the initial comment on the new coinage concerned the novelty of a contest, its failure, and the inevitable result that the commission would go, as always, to the Chief Engraver [Barber] and his staff."

George Heath, editor of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", discussed the new pieces: "the mechanical work is all that could be desired, and it is probable that owing to the conventional rut in which our mint authorities seem obliged to keep, this is the best that could be done". W.T.R. Martin wrote in the "American Journal of Numismatics", "The general effect is pleasing, of the three the Dime is to many the most attractive piece. The head of Liberty is dignified, but although the silly story has been started that the profile is that of a 'reigning belle' of New York, she can hardly be called a beauty; there is a suggestion ... of the classic heads on some of the Roman coins, and a much stronger suggestion of the head on the French Francs of 1871 and onward ... these coins are an advance on what has hitherto been accomplished, but there is yet a long distance between them and the ideal National coin."

Other reactions were unfavorable. Artist <a href="Kenyon%20Cox">Kenyon Cox</a>, one of the invited artists to the 1891 competition, stated, "I think it disgraceful that this great country should have such a coin as this." "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" proclaimed, "The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse." Saint-Gaudens was also interviewed, and as author Moran put it, "injudiciously ranted": "This is inept; this looks like it had been designed by a young lady of sixteen, a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling. It is beneath criticism ... There are hundreds of artists in this country, any of whom, with the aid of a designer, could have made a very respectable coin, which this is not."

Soon after issuance of the new quarters, the Mint received complaints that they would not stack properly. Barber made adjustments in his design to remedy this problem. Accordingly, there are two versions of the 1892 quarter, dubbed "Type I" and "Type II", both for the version without mint mark struck at Philadelphia and for those struck at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans Mint</a> (1892-O) and the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> (1892-S). They may be distinguished by their reverses: Type I quarters have about half of the letter "E" in "UNITED" covered by the eagle's wing; with Type II quarters, the letter is almost entirely obscured. Type I quarters are rarer for each mint.

The <a href="1894-S%20Barber%20dime">1894-S Barber dime</a> is one of the great numismatic rarities, with a published mintage of 24 <a href="proof%20coinage">proof</a> pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for "The Numismatist", the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.

In 1900, Barber modified the dies. This change resulted in quarters that were thinner, so that 21 of the new coins would stack in the space occupied by 20 of the old. Barber again set to work on the dies. San Francisco Mint officials wanted permission to use the old dies, which was refused, as it was felt that all mints should be producing coins with the same specifications. There are small differences between quarters produced at the different mints.

Except for the 1894-S dime, there are no great rarities in the series, as mintages were generally adequate to high. Key dates for the dime include the 1895-O (with the lowest mintage), 1896-S, 1897-O, 1901-S and 1903-S. For the quarter, key dates are the very low mintage 1896-S, 1901-S, and 1913-S issues, with the 1901-S particularly scarce. The rarest half dollar is the 1892-O "Micro O", in which the mint mark "O" for New Orleans was impressed on the half dollar die with a puncheon intended for the quarter; other key dates are the regular 1892-O, 1892-S, 1893-S, 1897-O, 1897-S, 1913, 1914, and 1915. The last three dates have very low mintages but were preserved in substantial numbers. As half dollars were heavily circulated, prices tend to steeply rise for all coins in higher grades. "Condition rarities", relatively inexpensive in circulated condition but costly in high grades, include the 1901-S, 1904-S, and 1907-S half dollars. Thus, although most dates are obtainable, many are scarce in uncirculated grades. Note too that in 1909 a new half dollar hub was introduced. This made the headband word "Liberty" stronger, thus changing a grading diagnostic. Earlier Barber halves are frequently separately graded for their obverse and reverse characteristics, as the latter side tended to wear faster. Finally, large quantities of Barber coins were melted for bullion when silver prices rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

According to Burdette, "agitation to replace Barber's banal 1892 Liberty head began almost before the first coins were cold from the press." In 1894, the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Society">American Numismatic and Antiquarian Society</a>, in conjunction with various artistic and educational institutes, began to advocate for better designs for U.S. coins, but no change took place in the remainder of the 19th century.

In 1904, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> started to push for improvements to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for <a href="Saint-Gaudens%20double%20eagle">the double eagle</a> and <a href="Indian%20Head%20eagle">eagle</a>, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief before it could be released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the <a href="Indian%20Head%20gold%20pieces">smaller gold pieces</a>, <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>, and <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.

In 1915, a new Mint director, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Woolley">Robert W. Woolley</a>, took office. Woolley advocated the replacement of the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed <a href="Adolph%20Weinman">Adolph Weinman</a>, <a href="Hermon%20MacNeil">Hermon MacNeil</a>, and <a href="Albin%20Polasek">Albin Polasek</a> as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">half dollar</a>, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.

Woolley had hoped to begin production of the new coins on July 1, 1916. There was heavy demand for small change, and as delays in actual production stretched into the second half of the year, Woolley was forced to have Barber prepare dies for 1916-dated dimes and quarters bearing the chief engraver's 1892 design. According to numismatist David Lange, "Barber must have secretly smiled to himself as his familiar Roman bust of Liberty once again dropped from the presses by the thousands, and then by the millions." There were sufficient half dollars from 1915 available to meet demand; no Barber halves were struck in 1916. The production difficulties were eventually ironed out, and at least token quantities of each of the new coins were struck in 1916, putting an end to the Barber coinage series.

Billy Joe Tolliver (born February 7, 1966) is a former <a href="American%20football">American football</a> <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> who played in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) and <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> (CFL) for twelve seasons with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>, <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>, <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>, <a href="Shreveport%20Pirates">Shreveport Pirates</a>, <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, and <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>. Over the course of his NFL career, he played in 79 games, completed 891 of 1,707 <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23pass">passes</a> for 10,760 yards, threw 59 <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s and 64 <a href="interception">interception</a>s, and retired with a <a href="passer%20rating">passer rating</a> of 67.7.

A graduate of <a href="Boyd%20High%20School%20%28Texas%29">Boyd High School</a> and <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Tech University</a>, Tolliver was selected 51st in the <a href="1989%20NFL%20Draft">1989 NFL Draft</a> by the San Diego Chargers. He started 19 games in two seasons at San Diego before being traded to Atlanta, where he saw playing time as a backup for three seasons. In 1994, he became one of three starting quarterbacks for Houston and then served as quarterback of the Shreveport Pirates in the CFL during their final season of activity in 1995. After not competing in 1996, Tolliver played for both Atlanta and Kansas City in 1997. He then started 11 games for New Orleans in two seasons but did not take the field in 2000. A stint with the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the 2001 offseason concluded his professional career.

Tolliver was born in <a href="Boyd%2C%20Texas">Boyd, Texas</a>, where he attended local schools. He played <a href="high%20school%20football">high school football</a> at <a href="Boyd%20High%20School%20%28Texas%29">Boyd High School</a>. During his senior season, he led the Boyd Yellow Jackets to a 15–0–1 record and the 2–A state championship. He amassed more than 1,000 <a href="Carry%20%28gridiron%20football%29">rushing</a> and passing yards and was named Player of the Year by the "<a href="Fort%20Worth%20Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>". Tolliver was a three–sport athlete in high school, averaging 15 points and 17 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a> in basketball and throwing 14 <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>s in baseball.

After graduating from high school, Tolliver played <a href="college%20football">college football</a> at <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Tech University</a> and was a member of the <a href="Delta%20Tau%20Delta">Delta Tau Delta</a> Fraternity. His hard throwing style led Texas Tech head coach <a href="David%20McWilliams%20%28American%20football%29">David McWilliams</a> to say, "He throws the ball harder, and with more velocity, than anyone I've ever seen." He <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirted</a> his freshman season in 1984 and became the starting quarterback in 1985. On November 9, 1985, Tolliver had his first breakout performance for the <a href="Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20football">Red Raiders</a> as he threw for a record-setting 422 yards and five touchdowns in a 63–7 win over <a href="TCU%20Horned%20Frogs%20football">Texas Christian University</a> (TCU), a feat that helped him become a household name in Texas. As he began his sophomore season, he was considered the lone bright spot on Texas Tech's offense. Tolliver struggled at the start of the year; by the end of September he had only completed 54 of 123 passes. After throwing five interceptions in a game against <a href="Baylor%20Bears%20football">Baylor</a>, he shrugged off the bad game, saying, "even <a href="Betty%20Crocker">Betty Crocker</a> burns a cake every now and then." His fortunes continued to sink when in a game in late October against the <a href="Rice%20Owls%20football">Rice Owls</a>, he was benched, and backup quarterback Monte McGuire rallied the team to a victory. However, Tolliver regained his starting job and brought his team to the <a href="1986%20Independence%20Bowl">1986 Independence Bowl</a> as Texas Tech won six games for the first time since 1978. He finished the season with 1,802 passing yards and seven touchdowns.

Tolliver began his junior year facing <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football">Florida State</a>, a game in which he suffered a hairline fracture in his foot, leaving him doubtful for the match. He missed the first three games of the season but returned in Texas Tech's fourth game against Baylor, completing 14 of 25 passes for 189 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 36–22 loss. Tolliver's next big performance came against TCU, the same team he defeated 63–7 as a freshman. He threw a touchdown pass to <a href="Wayne%20Walker%20%28wide%20receiver%29">Wayne Walker</a> in the last minute to beat TCU 36–35. He finished the season having passed for 1,422 yards and seven touchdowns in eight games. The next season, his senior year, Tolliver and Texas Tech sought to win the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a>. He started the season strong, throwing an 85-yard pass against <a href="Arizona%20Wildcats%20football">Arizona</a>—it was the third-longest pass in school history—but the Red Raiders started with two losses. By the end of the season, Tolliver had set 16 school records and was awarded the Southwest Conference Sportsmanship Award by the league's officials. After four seasons with Texas Tech, he set the school record for career passing yards (6,756), career pass attempts (1,008), career pass completions (493), career touchdown passes (38), season passing yards in 1988 (2,869), and single game passing yards (446) against <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20football">Oklahoma State University</a> in 1988. Tolliver was inducted into Texas Tech's Hall of Honor in 2002.

Tolliver was selected by the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> in the second round of the <a href="1989%20NFL%20Draft">1989 NFL Draft</a>. The Chargers traded third, fourth, and seventh-round picks in exchange for the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a>' second-round pick in order to draft him. Tolliver was signed on July 31, 1989, after a short holdout. He was to compete with <a href="Mark%20Malone">Mark Malone</a> and <a href="David%20Archer%20%28quarterback%29">David Archer</a> for the starting job, a spot which eventually went to <a href="Jim%20McMahon">Jim McMahon</a> after the Chargers traded for him. As the 1989 season began with McMahon as the helm, Tolliver was slated to play the second half of the final preseason game against the <a href="Phoenix%20Cardinals">Phoenix Cardinals</a>. After 13 completions in 23 attempts, Tolliver ran the ball late in the game and broke his <a href="collarbone">collarbone</a>, sidelining him for at least six weeks. After spending the first seven games on the <a href="injured%20reserve%20list">injured reserve list</a>, Tolliver was taken off the list and named the starter for the game against the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> on October 29, replacing McMahon who had disappointed at quarterback. In Tolliver's first start, he played three quarters, throwing six completed passes in 17 attempts for 41 yards and throwing an interception in a 10–7 loss. Tolliver subsequently lost the starting job back to McMahon. However, in late November, Tolliver was given the starting job back, remaining the starting quarterback the rest of the season. Tolliver finished the season having played five games with 89 completions in 185 attempts, 1097 yards, five touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 57.9 quarterback rating.

As the 1990 season began, McMahon was released by the team, leaving Tolliver as the starting quarterback at <a href="training%20camp">training camp</a>. After training camp and a preseason in which Tolliver started and was relieved by quarterbacks <a href="Mark%20Vlasic">Mark Vlasic</a> and rookie <a href="John%20Friesz">John Friesz</a>, Chargers head coach <a href="Dan%20Henning">Dan Henning</a> named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> in the season opener, saying that he was "steadier" than Tolliver. After a loss against Dallas, Tolliver regained his starting job during the game two against the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>. Despite some shaky performances in the following weeks, the Chargers' coaching staff stuck by their quarterback, saying that "the last thing we need around here is more change." Tolliver played nearly the rest of the season as the starting quarterback but was replaced by Friesz for the final game of the season against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Raiders">Los Angeles Raiders</a>. The Chargers made this move because, according to Henning, "Tolliver has to work on his shortcomings." Tolliver finished the season having completed 216 of 410 passes, thrown for 2,574 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions, and posting a QB rating of 68.9.

Although Tolliver had the confidence of Dan Henning, Chargers general manager <a href="Bobby%20Beathard">Bobby Beathard</a> and owner <a href="Alex%20Spanos">Alex Spanos</a> were unsatisfied with his production during the 1990 season, and were looking towards Friesz as the future quarterback. Tolliver was the leading man for the starting quarterback position as training camp for the 1991 season began, with Friesz battling <a href="Bob%20Gagliano">Bob Gagliano</a> for the backup spot. However, after training camp ended, Friesz was named the starting quarterback for the 1991 season opener against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>.

Just a few days after losing the starting job, Tolliver was traded to the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> for a fifth-round draft pick. In Atlanta, Tolliver was the backup quarterback behind <a href="Chris%20Miller%20%28American%20football%29">Chris Miller</a> and alongside rookie <a href="Brett%20Favre">Brett Favre</a>, and played part of seven games throughout the season. Tolliver's breakthrough as a Falcon came against the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> on November 3. Miller was injured in the second quarter, and Tolliver was brought in for the rest of the game. With one second left, he threw a 44-yard <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">Hail Mary pass</a> to <a href="Michael%20Haynes%20%28wide%20receiver%29">Michael Haynes</a>, which was caught for a touchdown and sealing a 17–14 upset victory. Due to his performance and Miller's injury, Tolliver was given his first start the following week against the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. Tolliver's first start with the Falcons was a 56–17 blowout loss. Afterwards, Tolliver got his second and last start of the season against the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> as a result of Miller suddenly running a fever. Tolliver finished the regular season having completing 40 of 82 passes with four touchdowns, two interceptions, and a QB rating of 75.8.

After the Falcons traded Favre to the Packers, Miller and Tolliver were the only quarterbacks on the roster. Before the season started, <a href="Wade%20Wilson%20%28American%20football%29">Wade Wilson</a> signed with the team, and the two shared the role of backup to Miller. Tolliver played two of the first eight games, then was named the starting quarterback when the Falcons lost Miller for the season as a result of <a href="reconstructive%20surgery">reconstructive surgery</a> on his left knee. Tolliver's first start of the season came against the 49ers. He completed 16 of 25 passes, but threw three interceptions in a 41–3 loss. The next week against the Cardinals, Tolliver was benched for the final series as Wilson led the team to victory and Tolliver argued with coach <a href="Jerry%20Glanville">Jerry Glanville</a>. Despite the conflict and a shoulder injury, Glanville gave Tolliver the start the following week against the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a>. He played a few more games before being replaced by Wilson for the rest of the season, partially as a result of Wilson throwing five touchdown passes in his first start en route to a 35–7 Falcons victory. Tolliver finished the season with five touchdowns, five interceptions, a 55.7% completion percentage, and a 70.4 QB rating.

After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a restricted <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>. Wilson signed a contract with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed <a href="Bobby%20Hebert">Bobby Hebert</a>. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after holding out for a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured his left knee in late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed <a href="Chris%20Hakel">Chris Hakel</a> as a result of the injury. Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the course of the year, Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.

In early September 1994, Tolliver was signed to a contract by the <a href="Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a>. He was originally the third-string quarterback, but ineffectiveness by <a href="Bucky%20Richardson">Bucky Richardson</a> led Tolliver to relieve him in a game against the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>. Tolliver played well enough to be considered for the starting job the following week due to <a href="Cody%20Carlson">Cody Carlson</a> dealing with injuries. Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. After finishing the season, Tolliver became a free agent and left the NFL.

Tolliver signed a three-year contract worth about $1 million with the <a href="Shreveport%20Pirates">Shreveport Pirates</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> before the 1995 season began. Early in the season, Tolliver got to compete against former teammate David Archer in the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Texans">San Antonio Texans</a>' CFL debut. He finished the season having thrown for 3,767 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. After the team folded following a 5–13 season, Tolliver was again without a team. In October 1996, Tolliver rejoined the Falcons as the third-string quarterback, this time sitting behind <a href="Bobby%20Hebert">Bobby Hebert</a> and <a href="Browning%20Nagle">Browning Nagle</a>. He spent the 1996 season on the bench, and did not take a snap in a game. He was re-signed by Atlanta in April and given a one-year contract worth $325,000.

Tolliver was slated to compete with <a href="Tommy%20Maddox">Tommy Maddox</a> for the backup quarterback spot at Atlanta as training camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind <a href="Chris%20Chandler">Chris Chandler</a>. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, but instead came in late in the game. He was almost able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went down with an injury in late October, coach <a href="Dan%20Reeves">Dan Reeves</a> chose to start <a href="Tony%20Graziani">Tony Graziani</a>. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback <a href="Elvis%20Grbac">Elvis Grbac</a> was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.

After Saints quarterback <a href="Billy%20Joe%20Hobert">Billy Joe Hobert</a> was lost for the season with a ruptured <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a>, the Saints signed Tolliver to a two-year deal. After four starts by <a href="Danny%20Wuerffel">Danny Wuerffel</a>, Saints coach <a href="Mike%20Ditka">Mike Ditka</a> gave Tolliver the start against the Atlanta Falcons. After starting for four weeks and having a few impressive performances, Tolliver was benched in favor of <a href="Kerry%20Collins">Kerry Collins</a>, who finished the season as starting quarterback. Tolliver finished the year with one of his most statistically impressive seasons, completing 110 of 199 passes for 1,427 yards, eight touchdowns, four interceptions, and finishing with a QB rating of 83.1.

Tolliver started the 1999 season as Hobert's backup. Hobert started the first four games but was injured, leaving Tolliver to start against the <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> on October 17 and the Giants the week after. Hobert started the next game, but suffered a <a href="pinched%20nerve">pinched nerve</a> in his neck, resulting in Tolliver's third start of the season against the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. Against the 49ers, he scored the third and fourth rushing touchdowns of his career en route to a 24–6 win. However, the next week against the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, Tolliver suffered a torn <a href="medial%20collateral%20ligament">MCL</a>, and he was considered likely to miss the rest of the season. A couple of weeks later, Tolliver had bounced back from his injury by "treating himself with some <a href="WD-40">WD-40</a>" and was named the starter in the December 12 game against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>. Tolliver was again injured the following week against the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, putting an end to his season, which he finished with a 51.9 completion percentage, 1,916 yards, seven touchdowns, 16 interceptions, and a QB rating of 58.9.

Throughout the 1999 season, Tolliver remained a vocal supporter of coach Ditka despite the Saints' 3–13 record, saying "I think he's a heck of a football coach, a great motivator. We just got to start buying what he's selling." Ditka was fired by the Saints, but as training camp for the 2000 season began, Tolliver was the Saints' backup quarterback behind <a href="Jeff%20Blake">Jeff Blake</a>. On August 1, the Saints traded for quarterback <a href="Aaron%20Brooks%20%28American%20football%29">Aaron Brooks</a>, which left Tolliver to compete for the third-string spot alongside <a href="Jake%20Delhomme">Jake Delhomme</a>. The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut. When the Saints lost Jeff Blake for the season in mid-November due to a dislocated foot, Tolliver was re-signed by the Saints, though he did not play a game that season. In July 2001, Tolliver was signed by the Green Bay Packers. This briefly reunited him with Brett Favre, with whom he was teammates in Atlanta. However, he was cut on August 21, 2001 when <a href="Doug%20Pederson">Doug Pederson</a> won the backup job, and this stint marked the end of Tolliver's professional career.

Tolliver was named after his uncle Joe and aunt Billie. He and his wife, Sheila, have five children, Charles, Austin, Mackenzie, Bryce, and Brody.

Tolliver is an avid <a href="golf">golf</a>er and has played many celebrity tournaments. He is a four-time winner of the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship and won the $75,000 Isuzu Celebrity Golf Challenge in 1996. He is a regular competitor at the American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe, the annual competition to determine the best golfers among American sports and entertainment celebrities.

Afroyim v. Rusk

Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967), is a major <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case in which the Court ruled that <a href="citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">citizens of the United States</a> may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, because he had cast a vote in an <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i election after becoming a <a href="naturalization">naturalized</a> U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the <a href="Citizenship%20Clause">Citizenship Clause</a> of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution</a>. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own <a href="precedent">precedent</a>s, "<a href="Perez%20v.%20Brownell">Perez v. Brownell</a>" (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.

The "Afroyim" decision opened the way for a wider acceptance of <a href="multiple%20citizenship">dual (or multiple) citizenship</a> in United States law. The <a href="Bancroft%20Treaties">Bancroft Treaties</a>—a series of agreements between the United States and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization—were eventually abandoned after the <a href="Carter%20administration">Carter administration</a> concluded that "Afroyim" and other Supreme Court decisions had rendered them unenforceable.

The impact of "Afroyim v. Rusk" was narrowed by a later case, "<a href="Rogers%20v.%20Bellei">Rogers v. Bellei</a>" (1971), in which the Court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment safeguarded citizenship only when a person was born or naturalized in the United States, and that Congress retained authority to regulate the citizenship status of a person who was born outside the United States to an American parent. However, the specific law at issue in "Rogers v. Bellei"—a requirement for a minimum period of U.S. residence that Bellei had failed to satisfy—was repealed by Congress in 1978. As a consequence of revised policies adopted in 1990 by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a>, it is now (in the words of one expert) "virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it."

<a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">Citizenship in the United States</a> has historically been acquired in one of three ways: by birth in the United States ("<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>", "right of the soil"); by birth outside the United States to an American parent ("<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>", "right of the blood"); or by <a href="immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigration to the United States</a> followed by <a href="naturalization">naturalization</a>.

In 1857, the Supreme Court <a href="holding%20%28law%29">held</a> in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" that <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">African slaves</a>, former slaves, and their descendants were not eligible to be citizens. After the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> (1861–65) and the resulting abolition of slavery in the United States, steps were taken to grant citizenship to the freed slaves. Congress first enacted the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, which included a clause declaring "all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power" to be citizens. Even as the Civil Rights Act was being debated in Congress, its opponents argued that the citizenship provision was <a href="unconstitutional">unconstitutional</a>. In light of this concern, as well as to protect the new grant of citizenship for former slaves from being repealed by a later Congress, the drafters of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution</a> included a <a href="Citizenship%20Clause">Citizenship Clause</a>, which would entrench in the Constitution (and thereby set beyond the future reach of Congress or the courts) a guarantee of citizenship stating that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States". The Fourteenth Amendment—including the Citizenship Clause—was <a href="Article%20Five%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">ratified by state legislatures</a> and became a part of the Constitution in 1868.

The Constitution does not specifically deal with loss of citizenship. An amendment proposed by Congress in 1810—the <a href="Titles%20of%20Nobility%20Amendment">Titles of Nobility Amendment</a>—would, if ratified, have provided that any citizen who accepted any "present, pension, office or emolument" from a foreign country, without the consent of Congress, would "cease to be a citizen of the United States"; however, this amendment was never ratified by a sufficient number of state legislatures and, as a result, never became a part of the Constitution.
Ever since the affirmation by Congress, in the <a href="Expatriation%20Act%20of%201868">Expatriation Act of 1868</a>, that individuals had an inherent right to <a href="expatriation">expatriation</a> (giving up of citizenship), it has historically been accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship. This possibility was noted by the Supreme Court in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Wong%20Kim%20Ark">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a>", an 1898 case involving a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were legally <a href="Domicile%20%28law%29">domiciled</a> in the country. After ruling in this case that Wong was born a U.S. citizen despite his Chinese ancestry, the Court went on to state that his birthright citizenship "[had] not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth."

The <a href="Nationality%20Act%20of%201940">Nationality Act of 1940</a> provided for loss of citizenship based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for <a href="desertion">desertion</a> from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to <a href="draft%20evasion">evade military service</a> during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case ("<a href="Nishikawa%20v.%20Dulles">Nishikawa v. Dulles</a>"), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case ("<a href="Trop%20v.%20Dulles">Trop v. Dulles</a>").

However, in yet another 1958 case ("<a href="Perez%20v.%20Brownell">Perez v. Brownell</a>)," the Supreme Court affirmed the provision revoking the citizenship of any American who had voted in an election in a foreign country, as a legitimate exercise (under the Constitution's <a href="Necessary%20and%20Proper%20Clause">Necessary and Proper Clause</a>) of Congress' authority to regulate foreign affairs and avoid potentially embarrassing diplomatic situations. <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice</a> <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, the author of the opinion of the Court (supported by a 5–4 majority), wrote that:

In a dissenting opinion, <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> argued that "Citizenship is man's basic right, for it is nothing less than the right to have rights" and that "a government of the people cannot take away their citizenship simply because one branch of that government can be said to have a conceivably rational basis for wanting to do so." While Warren was willing to allow for loss of citizenship as a result of foreign naturalization or other actions "by which [an American] manifests allegiance to a foreign state [which] may be so inconsistent with the retention of [U.S.] citizenship as to result in loss of that status", he wrote that "In specifying that any act of voting in a foreign political election results in loss of citizenship, Congress has employed a classification so broad that it encompasses conduct that fails to show a voluntary abandonment of American citizenship."

Two Supreme Court decisions after "Perez" called into question the principle that loss of citizenship could occur even without the affected individual's intent. In "<a href="Kennedy%20v.%20Mendoza-Martinez">Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez</a>" (1963), the Court struck down a law revoking citizenship for remaining outside the United States in order to avoid conscription into the armed forces. Associate Justice <a href="William%20J.%20Brennan">William J. Brennan</a> (who had been in the majority in "Perez") wrote a separate opinion concurring with the majority in "Mendoza-Martinez" and expressing reservations about "Perez". In "<a href="Schneider%20v.%20Rusk">Schneider v. Rusk</a>" (1964), where the Court invalidated a provision revoking the citizenship of naturalized citizens who returned to live permanently in their countries of origin, Brennan <a href="recused">recused</a> himself and did not participate in the decision of the case.

Beys Afroyim (born Ephraim Bernstein, 1893?–1984) was an <a href="Painting">artist</a> and active <a href="communist">communist</a>. Various sources state that he was born in either 1893 or 1898, and either in Poland generally, specifically in the Polish town of <a href="Ryki">Ryki</a>, or in <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> (then part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>). In 1912, Afroyim immigrated to the United States, and on June 14, 1926, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He studied at the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, as well as the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Design">National Academy of Design</a> in New York City, and he was commissioned to paint portraits of <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>, and <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>. In 1949, Afroyim left the United States and settled in Israel, together with his wife and former student <a href="Soshana%20Afroyim">Soshana</a> (an Austrian artist).

In 1960, following the breakdown of his marriage, Afroyim decided to return to the United States, but the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> refused to renew his U.S. passport, ruling that because Afroyim had voted in the <a href="Israeli%20legislative%20election%2C%201951">1951 Israeli legislative election</a>, he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. A letter certifying Afroyim's loss of citizenship was issued by the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> (INS) on January 13, 1961.

Afroyim challenged the revocation of his citizenship. Initially, he claimed that he had not in fact voted in Israel's 1951 election, but had entered the <a href="polling%20place">polling place</a> solely in order to draw sketches of voters casting their ballots. Afroyim's initial challenge was rejected in administrative proceedings in 1965. He then sued in <a href="federal%20district%20court">federal district court</a>, with his lawyer agreeing to a <a href="stipulation">stipulation</a> that Afroyim had in fact voted in Israel, but arguing that the statute under which this action had resulted in his losing his citizenship was unconstitutional. A federal judge of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> rejected Afroyim's claim on February 25, 1966, concluding that "in the opinion of Congress voting in a foreign political election could import 'allegiance to another country' in some measure 'inconsistent with American citizenship'" and that the question of this law's validity had been settled by the Supreme Court's 1958 "Perez" decision.

Afroyim appealed the district court's ruling against him to the <a href="Second%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, which upheld the lower court's reasoning and decision on May 24, 1966. Two of the three judges who heard Afroyim's appeal found the district court's analysis and affirmation of "Perez" to be "exhaustive and most penetrating". The third judge expressed serious reservations regarding the viability of "Perez" and suggested that Afroyim might have obtained a different result if he had framed his case differently, but decided to concur (albeit reluctantly) in the majority's ruling.

After losing his appeal to the Second Circuit, Afroyim asked the Supreme Court to overrule the <a href="precedent">precedent</a> it had established in "Perez", strike down the foreign voting provision of the Nationality Act as unconstitutional, and decide that he was still a United States citizen. Afroyim's counsel argued that since "neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to take away [U.S.] citizenship once it has been acquired ... the only way [Afroyim] could lose his citizenship was by his own voluntary renunciation of it." The Supreme Court <a href="certiorari">agreed to consider</a> Afroyim's case on October 24, 1966 and held oral arguments on February 20, 1967.
The official <a href="respondent">respondent</a> (defendant) in Afroyim's case on behalf of the U.S. government was <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> during the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy</a> and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Johnson</a> administrations (1961–1969). The <a href="legal%20brief">legal brief</a> laying out Afroyim's arguments was written by Nanette Dembitz, <a href="general%20counsel">general counsel</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">New York Civil Liberties Union</a>; the government's brief was written by <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">United States Solicitor General</a> (and future Supreme Court Associate Justice) <a href="Thurgood%20Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a>. The oral arguments in the case were presented by attorneys <a href="Edward%20Ennis">Edward Ennis</a>—chairman of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU)—for Afroyim, and Charles Gordon—general counsel for the INS—for the government. Afroyim was in New York City at this time, having been granted a visitor's visa in 1965 while his case went through the courts.

Before heading the ACLU, Ennis had served as general counsel for the INS. In his oral argument supporting Afroyim, Ennis asserted that Congress lacked the power to prescribe forfeiture of citizenship, and he sharply criticized the foreign-relations argument under which the "Perez" court had upheld loss of citizenship for voting in a foreign election—pointing out, for example, that when a <a href="Saar%20status%20referendum%2C%201935">referendum was held in 1935</a> on the status of the <a href="Saar%20%28League%20of%20Nations%29">Saar</a> (a region of Germany occupied after World War I by the United Kingdom and France), Americans had participated in the voting without raising any concerns within the State Department at the time.

Gordon did not make a good showing in the "Afroyim" oral arguments despite his skill and experience in the field of immigration law, according to a 2005 article on the "Afroyim" case by law professor <a href="Peter%20J.%20Spiro">Peter J. Spiro</a>. Gordon mentioned Israeli elections in 1955 and 1959 in which Afroyim had voted—facts which had not previously been presented to the Supreme Court in the attorneys' briefs or the written record of the case—and much of the remaining questioning from the justices involved criticism of Gordon for confusing matters through the last-minute introduction of this new material.

Afroyim's earlier stipulation that he had voted in the 1951 Israeli election—together with an accompanying concession by the government that this was the sole ground upon which it had acted to revoke Afroyim's citizenship—allowed the potential issue of diluted <a href="allegiance">allegiance</a> through dual citizenship to be sidestepped. Indeed, in 1951 there was no <a href="Israeli%20nationality%20law">Israeli nationality law</a>; eligibility to vote in the election that year had been based on residence rather than any concept of citizenship. Although Afroyim had later acquired Israeli citizenship and voted in at least two other elections in his new country, his lawyers were able to avoid discussing this matter and instead focus entirely on whether foreign voting was a sufficient cause for loss of one's U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court ruled in Afroyim's favor in a 5–4 decision issued on May 29, 1967. The opinion of the Court—written by Associate Justice <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a>, and joined by Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> and <a href="Abe%20Fortas">Abe Fortas</a>—as well as Associate Justice Brennan, who had been part of the majority in "Perez"—was grounded in the reasoning Warren had used nine years earlier in his "Perez" dissent. The court's majority now held that "Congress has no power under the Constitution to divest a person of his United States citizenship absent his voluntary renunciation thereof." Specifically repudiating "Perez", the majority of the justices rejected the claim that Congress had any power to revoke citizenship and said that "no such power can be sustained as an implied attribute of sovereignty". Instead, quoting from the Citizenship Clause, Black wrote:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States..." There is no indication in these words of a fleeting citizenship, good at the moment it is acquired but subject to destruction by the Government at any time. Rather the Amendment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it. Once acquired, this Fourteenth Amendment citizenship was not to be shifted, canceled, or diluted at the will of the Federal Government, the States, or any other governmental unit.

The Court found support for its position in the history of the unratified <a href="Titles%20of%20Nobility%20Amendment">Titles of Nobility Amendment</a>. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.

Afroyim's counsel had addressed only the foreign voting question and had carefully avoided any direct challenge to the idea that foreign naturalization might legitimately lead to loss of citizenship (a concept which Warren had been willing to accept in his "Perez" dissent). Nevertheless, the Court's "Afroyim" ruling went beyond even Warren's earlier position—holding instead that "The very nature of our government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship."

The minority—in a dissent written by Associate Justice <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan%20II">John Marshall Harlan II</a> and joined by Associate Justices <a href="Tom%20C.%20Clark">Tom C. Clark</a>, <a href="Potter%20Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>, and <a href="Byron%20White">Byron White</a>—argued that "Perez" had been correctly decided, that nothing in the Constitution deprived Congress of the power to revoke a person's citizenship for good cause, and that Congress was within its rights to decide that allowing Americans to vote in foreign elections ran contrary to the foreign policy interests of the nation and ought to result in loss of citizenship. Harlan wrote:

Responding to the assertion that Congress did not have power to revoke a person's citizenship without his or her assent, Harlan predicted that "Until the Court indicates with greater precision what it means by 'assent', today's opinion will surely cause still greater confusion in this area of the law."

The "Afroyim" decision stated that no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court <a href="distinguish">distinguish</a>ed a 1971 case, "<a href="Rogers%20v.%20Bellei">Rogers v. Bellei</a>", holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via "jus sanguinis", through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) was the result of federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since "Afroyim", was repealed at the same time.

Although "Afroyim" appeared to rule out any involuntary revocation of a person's citizenship, the government continued for the most part to pursue loss-of-citizenship cases when an American had acted in a way believed to imply an intent to give up citizenship—especially when an American had become a naturalized citizen of another country. In a 1980 case, however—"<a href="Vance%20v.%20Terrazas">Vance v. Terrazas</a>"—the Supreme Court ruled that intent to relinquish citizenship needed to be proved by itself, and not simply inferred from an individual's having voluntarily performed an action designated by Congress as being incompatible with an intent to keep one's citizenship.

The concept of dual citizenship, which previously had been strongly opposed by the U.S. government, has become more accepted in the years since "Afroyim". In 1980, the administration of President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> concluded that the <a href="Bancroft%20Treaties">Bancroft Treaties</a>—a series of bilateral agreements, formulated between 1868 and 1937, which provided for automatic loss of citizenship upon foreign naturalization of a U.S. citizen—were no longer enforceable, due in part to "Afroyim", and gave notice terminating these treaties. In 1990, the State Department adopted new guidelines for evaluating potential loss-of-citizenship cases, under which the government now assumes in almost all situations that Americans do not in fact intend to give up their citizenship unless they explicitly indicate to U.S. officials that this is their intention. As explained by Peter J. Spiro, "In the long run, "Afroyim"'s vision of an absolute right to retain citizenship has been largely, if quietly, vindicated. As a matter of practice, it is now virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it."

While acknowledging that "American citizenship enjoys strong protection against loss under "Afroyim" and "Terrazas"", retired journalist Henry S. Matteo suggested, "It would have been more equitable ... had the Supreme Court relied on the <a href="Eighth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighth Amendment</a>, which adds a moral tone as well as a firmer constitutional basis, than the Fourteenth." Matteo also said, "Under "Afroyim" there is a lack of balance between rights and protections on one hand, and obligations and responsibilities on the other, all four elements of which have been an integral part of the concept of citizenship, as history shows." Political scientist <a href="P.%20Allan%20Dionisopoulos">P. Allan Dionisopoulos</a> wrote that "it is doubtful that any [Supreme Court decision] created a more complex problem for the United States than "Afroyim v. Rusk"", a decision which he believed had "since become a source of embarrassment for the United States in its relationships with the Arab world" because of the way it facilitated dual U.S.–Israeli citizenship and participation by Americans in Israel's armed forces.

After his Supreme Court victory, Afroyim divided his time between <a href="West%20Brighton">West Brighton</a> (<a href="Staten%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Staten Island</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>) and the Israeli city of <a href="Safed">Safed</a> until his death on May 19, 1984, in West Brighton.

Rex Ryan

Rex Ashley Ryan (born December 13, 1962) is a former <a href="American%20football">American football</a> coach and current <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> analyst. Ryan was formerly the head coach of the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> and <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL), and also held various coaching positions with eight other NFL and college teams.

Ryan is the son of former head coach <a href="Buddy%20Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a> and is the fraternal twin brother of <a href="Rob%20Ryan">Rob Ryan</a>. From a young age, Ryan aspired to follow in his father's footsteps and become a professional football coach. After spending the majority of his youth in Canada, Ryan returned to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> as a teenager where he attended college at <a href="Southwestern%20Oklahoma%20State%20University">Southwestern Oklahoma State University</a>. Upon graduating, Ryan spent the next 22 years serving as an assistant coach on different teams at both the college and professional level.

At the behest of their head coach <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a>, Ryan joined the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> in 1999 and spent nine years there. In 2005, he became the defensive coordinator, and later was promoted to be the team's assistant head coach in 2008. Ryan later accepted a contract offer from the Jets for their vacant head coaching position for the <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2009 season</a>. During his tenure, Ryan became well known throughout the league for his outspoken manner, boisterous attitude, and initial success with the Jets. In his first two seasons as the Jets' head coach, he led the team to back-to-back <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">AFC Championship Game</a> appearances. Ryan's subsequent tenure was a period of struggles, as the Jets were unable to finish with a record above a .500 winning percentage. After a career worst 4–12 record at the conclusion of the <a href="2014%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2014 season</a>, Ryan was fired as the team's head coach. Shortly after his firing from the Jets, Ryan was hired to be the Bills' head coach, where he lasted two years with the team before being fired at the end of the <a href="2016%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2016 season</a>.

Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, <a href="Rob%20Ryan">Rob</a>, were born in <a href="Ardmore%2C%20Oklahoma">Ardmore, Oklahoma</a>, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and <a href="Buddy%20Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a>. When the boys were aged two, their parents amicably divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, where she secured an administrative position at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>. During the course of his upbringing, Rex wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, a defensive pioneer in the NFL known for developing the <a href="46%20defense">46 defense</a>, and by the age of six, Rex and Rob knew they wanted to pursue coaching careers.

In Canada, there was little emphasis on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided it was in the best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the <a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a> coach for the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.

In 1978, when Buddy was hired by the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a> as their <a href="defensive%20coordinator">defensive coordinator</a>, Rex, Rob, and Jim followed their father to <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> where the family settled in <a href="Prairie%20View%2C%20Illinois">Prairie View</a>. The brothers attended <a href="Stevenson%20High%20School%20%28Lincolnshire%2C%20Illinois%29">Stevenson High School</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire%2C%20Illinois">Lincolnshire</a>.

Rex went on to attend <a href="Southwestern%20Oklahoma%20State%20University">Southwestern Oklahoma State University</a> in <a href="Weatherford%2C%20Oklahoma">Weatherford, Oklahoma</a>, alongside Rob, and played for the football team as a <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a>. He graduated from Southwestern Oklahoma in 1986, and in 2011 was inducted into the university's Hall of Fame.

Upon graduating from Southwestern in 1986, with the help of his father, Ryan secured a job as a <a href="graduate%20assistant">graduate assistant</a> on the <a href="Division%20I-AA">Division I-AA</a> (now <a href="List%20of%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FCS%20football%20programs">Division I FCS</a>) <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20Colonels%20football">Eastern Kentucky Colonels football team</a>. At Eastern Kentucky, he had a multitude of responsibilities which ranged from making copies of game plans to picking players up at the airport. The Colonels won the <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Valley%20Conference%20football%20champions">Ohio Valley Conference title</a> in the two years Ryan served as an assistant. At the age of 26, Ryan became the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator at <a href="NCAA%20Division%20II">Division II</a> <a href="New%20Mexico%20Highlands">New Mexico Highlands</a> for a year, during which the team led the league in defensive turnovers. After his stint with New Mexico Highlands, Ryan joined Division I <a href="Morehead%20State">Morehead State</a> as the defensive coordinator, where he remained for four years. During his tenure, the defense was ranked among the highest in the nation.

After working for his father for two years with the NFL's <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Ryan returned to college coaching as the defensive coordinator for the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football">Cincinnati Bearcats</a>. The Bearcats won the first <a href="Humanitarian%20Bowl">Humanitarian Bowl</a> over <a href="Utah%20State%20Aggies%20football">Utah State</a> in Ryan's final year, marking the team's first bowl appearance in fifty years. Ryan was the <a href="Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football">Oklahoma Sooners</a>' defensive coordinator for a year in which the defense was ranked sixth in the nation. However, head coach <a href="John%20Blake%20%28American%20football%29">John Blake</a> failed to achieve a winning record for a third straight year and subsequently, the entire staff was fired. Ryan served as <a href="defensive%20coordinator">defensive coordinator</a> at <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State</a> for a month in 1999 under head coach <a href="Bill%20Snyder">Bill Snyder</a>.

When his father was hired as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals in 1994, he offered Rex his first job in the NFL as a defensive assistant, working with the team's <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a>s and <a href="Lineman%20%28American%20football%29">defensive linemen</a>. After nine straight losing seasons prior to Buddy's arrival, the Cardinals produced an 8–8 record in Buddy's first year as head coach. However, in his second season, the team went 4–12 and subsequently, the entire staff was fired despite the positive performance of the defense.

Ryan went on to coach at three different colleges following his tenure with the Cardinals, though by the time he joined <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State</a> in <a href="1999%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team">1999</a>, he was hopeful of a return to the NFL. Ryan received a call from newly named head coach <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a> of the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, who wanted to interview him for the defensive line coaching position. Having visited a class Ryan was teaching earlier in his career, Billick had been so impressed by Ryan's passion for the game of football that he decided to hire Ryan if he ever attained a head coaching position. When offered the position, Ryan accepted.

In his first year, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL and second in <a href="Carry%20%28American%20football%29">rushing yards</a> allowed. By his second year, in 2000, the Ravens' defense set NFL records for fewest <a href="American%20football%20rules%23Scoring">points</a> allowed and fewest rushing yards allowed. The defense allowed a combined 23 points in four playoff games en route to a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXV">Super Bowl XXXV</a> victory, Ryan's only <a href="Super%20Bowl%20ring">Super Bowl ring</a>, over the <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a>. The defense consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2005 following the departure of <a href="Mike%20Nolan">Mike Nolan</a>, who became the head coach of the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>. In 2006, Ryan received Assistant Coach of the Year awards from "<a href="Pro%20Football%20Weekly">Pro Football Weekly</a>" and the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Writers%20Association">Pro Football Writers Association</a>.

Upon the conclusion of the Ravens' 5–11 performance in <a href="2007%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">2007</a>, the entire staff was dismissed on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>. Ryan was one of the candidates interviewed by the Ravens for their head coaching vacancy;<ref name="Miami/Baltimore"></ref> however, the Ravens chose to name <a href="John%20Harbaugh">John Harbaugh</a> as the team's new head coach. Ryan also interviewed with <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami</a> and <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta</a> about filling their head coaching vacancies, but the offers went to <a href="Tony%20Sparano">Tony Sparano</a> and <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a> respectively.

Ryan was disappointed by his failure to obtain a head coaching job, but he agreed to return to Baltimore under the direction of Harbaugh, who retained Ryan as defensive coordinator and promoted him to assistant head coach. In 2008, Ryan's final year with the team, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL. The Ravens lost by a score of 23–14 in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NFL%20playoffs">AFC Championship Game</a> against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, during which the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL, concluded an hour later when he accepted the head coaching position with the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>.

Following a <a href="2008%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">late season collapse</a> in which the Jets missed the playoffs after losing four of their final five games, the team fired head coach <a href="Eric%20Mangini">Eric Mangini</a> on December 29, 2008. The team interviewed a host of candidates, including Ryan, <a href="Jeff%20Jagodzinski">Jeff Jagodzinski</a>, <a href="Russ%20Grimm">Russ Grimm</a>, <a href="Bill%20Callahan%20%28American%20football%29">Bill Callahan</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Schottenheimer">Brian Schottenheimer</a>; however, the contract, which was valued at approximately $11.5 million over the course of four years, was ultimately offered to Ryan.

Accepting the offer on January 19, 2009, Ryan immediately began to carry out a plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions on and off the field and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of <a href="SUNY%20Cortland">SUNY Cortland</a>, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager <a href="Mike%20Tannenbaum">Mike Tannenbaum</a> were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select <a href="Mark%20Sanchez">Mark Sanchez</a> of <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">USC</a> in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the <a href="2009%20NFL%20Draft">2009 NFL Draft</a>.

The Jets <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">opened their season</a> against the <a href="2009%20Houston%20Texans%20season">Houston Texans</a>. Ryan began his head coaching career with a 24–7 victory over the Texans in which the Jets' defense shut out their opponents' offense. Houston's lone score came on a fumble return for a touchdown. The following week, the defense did not allow a touchdown against the <a href="2009%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">New England Patriots</a> in a 16–9 victory at home, marking the Jets' first home victory over New England since <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2000</a>. Ryan and the Jets went on to defeat the <a href="2009%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season">Tennessee Titans</a> in Week 3, marking the first time the Jets opened the season at 3–0 since 2004. The victory also allowed Ryan to become the Jets' first rookie head coach to win his first three games since <a href="Al%20Groh">Al Groh</a> did so in 2000. Despite their hot start, New York went on to lose six of their next seven games save for a shutout victory over the <a href="2009%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season">Oakland Raiders</a>, 38–0.

The team eventually recovered and won five of their final six games despite Ryan mistakenly stating the Jets had been eliminated from playoff contention following a loss to the <a href="2009%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">Atlanta Falcons</a>. The Jets defeated a previously unbeaten <a href="2009%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season">Indianapolis Colts</a>—a game not without controversy following <a href="Jim%20Caldwell%20%28American%20football%29">Jim Caldwell</a>'s decision to pull Indianapolis' starters with the Colts leading. The Colts, who had already clinched a playoff berth, had little to play for aside from a <a href="Perfect%20season">perfect record</a>. In the final game of the season, the Jets defeated the <a href="2009%20Cincinnati%20Bengals%20season">Cincinnati Bengals</a> 37–0 at <a href="Giants%20Stadium">Giants Stadium</a>, the final sporting event to be held at the venue, as the defense held Cincinnati to 72 total rushing yards, and 0 total yards passing. The victory secured the Jets' playoff berth as a wild card team. Under Ryan, the Jets finished the regular season ranked first overall in the NFL in rushing yards and total defense. New York defeated Cincinnati again the following week, this time at <a href="Paul%20Brown%20Stadium">Paul Brown Stadium</a>, in the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%202009%E2%80%9310">AFC Wild Card playoff round</a> by a score of 24-14. On January 17, 2010, Ryan coached the Jets in an upset over the <a href="2009%20San%20Diego%20Chargers%20season">San Diego Chargers</a>, 17–14, on their way to the AFC Championship Game. The Jets subsequently lost to the Colts, 30–17, after leading in the first half of the game. Ryan became embroiled in controversy a few days later when he made an <a href="Finger%20%28gesture%29">obscene gesture</a> towards heckling <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Dolphins</a> fans who spat on him during a <a href="Strikeforce%20%28mixed%20martial%20arts%29">Strikeforce</a> <a href="mixed%20martial%20arts">mixed martial arts</a> event at <a href="BankAtlantic%20Center">BankAtlantic Center</a> in <a href="Sunrise%2C%20Florida">Sunrise, Florida</a>. Ryan apologized for his action, stating that it was "stupid and inappropriate." Ryan was fined $50,000 by the Jets.

As Ryan headed into his second year as the team's head coach, the club announced he had been given a two-year contract extension. Ryan continued to exude confidence in the team, writing on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s training camp tour bus "Soon To Be Champs" in August, referencing that the Jets would make it to the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> and become the eventual champions. Ryan had been asked to sign the Jets' logo on the back of the bus but included the message with his signature. The prediction was met with some criticism while others praised his brashness, something that was felt to be lacking in the NFL at the time. When the team appeared on the television series "<a href="Hard%20Knocks%20%28TV%20series%29">Hard Knocks</a>" that same month, Ryan was criticized, particularly by former head coach <a href="Tony%20Dungy">Tony Dungy</a>, for his use of <a href="foul%20language">foul language</a>. Dungy and Ryan later met in person to reconcile their differences. Ryan's championship claims were nearly proven correct as the Jets opened the season with the best record in the NFL at 9–2. This set the stage for a "<a href="Monday%20Night%20Football">Monday Night Football</a>" matchup with their <a href="AFC%20East">division</a> rival, the <a href="2010%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">Patriots</a>, who were also 9–2. The Patriots, behind the strong performance of quarterback <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a>, defeated the Jets 45–3. However, the Jets finished the season with an 11–5 record and qualified as a wild card team in the playoffs. The Jets were one win short of tying the franchise record in wins set by the <a href="1998%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">1998 team</a> led by <a href="Bill%20Parcells">Bill Parcells</a>.

In the Wild Card Round, the sixth-seeded Jets beat the <a href="AFC%20South">AFC South</a> champion and third-seeded <a href="2010%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season">Colts</a> 17–16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' <a href="Home%20%28sports%29">home field</a>, <a href="Lucas%20Oil%20Stadium">Lucas Oil Stadium</a>, to qualify for the Divisional Playoffs. The following week, on January 16, they defeated the AFC East champion and first-seeded Patriots 28–21, ending New England's eight-game winning streak. The victory made the Jets the first team to win back-to-back road playoff games in consecutive seasons, and qualified them to advance to the AFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season, where they lost on the road to the <a href="AFC%20North">AFC North</a> champion <a href="2010%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> 24–19.

The Jets opened their <a href="2011%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2011 campaign</a> with a 2–3 record, leading to discontent within their clubhouse. The team had begun to stray from its philosophy of consistently running the ball and began to pass more often, but the offense struggled with this adjustment. Wide receivers <a href="Plaxico%20Burress">Plaxico Burress</a>, <a href="Santonio%20Holmes">Santonio Holmes</a>, and <a href="Derrick%20Mason">Derrick Mason</a> reportedly approached coach Ryan to question offensive coordinator <a href="Brian%20Schottenheimer">Brian Schottenheimer</a>'s system. Ryan, meanwhile, had begun to isolate himself from the rest of the team as he became less "hands-on" and opted to have his assistants coach the players at their respective positions. Ryan attracted further attention to the team during a "Sunday Night Football" game against the <a href="2011%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">New England Patriots</a> when he responded to a heckling fan with an obscene remark and was fined $75,000 by the league. Despite struggling to an 8–7 record, the Jets still had the ability to attain a playoff berth if they won their regular season finale against the <a href="2011%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season">Miami Dolphins</a> in combination with the outcome of three other games played that day.

However, the discontent within the locker room and the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing and arguing with teammates in the <a href="huddle">huddle</a> against Miami. Holmes was <a href="benched">benched</a> in the fourth quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back <a href="LaDainian%20Tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a> remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on the locker room by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded this point and announced that he would refrain from making such statements publicly in the future.

Through 11 weeks in <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2012</a>, the Jets struggled to a 4–7 record. The presence of quarterback <a href="Tim%20Tebow">Tim Tebow</a> created a controversy as the media and fans called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow. Ryan was criticized for his decision to keep Tebow activated during the Jets' <a href="Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day</a> contest against the <a href="2012%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">New England Patriots</a> despite Tebow playing with two broken ribs, leading to questions about his job security. With Tebow inactive for the Jets' following contest against the <a href="2012%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Ryan made the decision to bench Sanchez, who threw three interceptions, in favor of <a href="Greg%20McElroy">Greg McElroy</a>. McElroy threw a touchdown pass to tight end <a href="Jeff%20Cumberland">Jeff Cumberland</a> to score the team's only points in a 7–6 victory over Arizona.

Ryan renamed Sanchez the starting quarterback the following Wednesday after seeking out multiple opinions within the organization. In a must win game against the <a href="2012%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season">Tennessee Titans</a> to remain in playoff contention, Sanchez struggled; he completed 13 of his 28 passes for 131 yards while throwing four interceptions and fumbling the ball in Titans territory in the closing minutes of the Jets' 14–10 defeat. A day later, Ryan announced McElroy would start. Sanchez started the final game of the season after McElroy suffered a concussion in his lone start. Sanchez's struggles continued as the Jets fell to the <a href="2012%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">Buffalo Bills</a> and ended their year with a 6–10 record, their first losing season under Rex Ryan. On December 31, 2012, the Jets fired general manager <a href="Mike%20Tannenbaum">Mike Tannenbaum</a>, but announced that Ryan would return for the 2013 season.

For the <a href="2013%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2013 campaign</a>, Ryan overhauled his coaching staff, promoting <a href="Dennis%20Thurman">Dennis Thurman</a> to defensive coordinator while adding several new coaches including offensive coordinator <a href="Marty%20Mornhinweg">Marty Mornhinweg</a>. Newly hired general manager <a href="John%20Idzik%2C%20Jr.">John Idzik</a> emphasized there would be competition at all positions including quarterback. The Jets drafted <a href="Geno%20Smith">Geno Smith</a> in the second round of the <a href="2013%20NFL%20Draft">2013 NFL Draft</a> to compete with Sanchez. Ryan was widely criticized for his decision to insert Sanchez late in a preseason game against the <a href="2013%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a> after Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury which led to Smith being named the starter.

Through their first nine games of the year, the Jets went 5–4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year consideration. The team proceeded to lose their next three contests as the rookie Smith committed eight turnovers while failing to score during that stretch. This prompted speculation by analysts as to whether or not Ryan would be fired. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37–27 win over the <a href="2013%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season">Raiders</a> that kept them in playoff contention. The following week, the Jets played the <a href="2013%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">Carolina Panthers</a> and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter. In the span of five minutes, the Panthers scored twice and the Jets were unable to complete a comeback attempt, losing 20–30. The loss eliminated the Jets from playoff contention.

New York played the <a href="2013%20Cleveland%20Browns%20season">Cleveland Browns</a> a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he expected to be fired at the end of the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in high spirits. Several players including <a href="Antonio%20Cromartie">Antonio Cromartie</a>, <a href="Calvin%20Pace">Calvin Pace</a>, and <a href="Willie%20Colon%20%28American%20football%29">Willie Colon</a> went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the <a href="2013%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season">Miami Dolphins</a> 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. In the locker room after the game, owner <a href="Woody%20Johnson">Woody Johnson</a> and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff contention and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.

The Jets opened the <a href="2014%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">2014 season</a> with a 19–14 win over the <a href="2014%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season">Oakland Raiders</a> but proceeded to lose their next eight games. <a href="Geno%20Smith">Geno Smith</a>, who started the year at quarterback, was replaced by veteran <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a> midway through the season. Vick helped to snap the losing streak in a Week 9 win over the <a href="2014%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. Despite the victory, Ryan was seen cursing at an unidentified person and was subsequently fined $100,000 by the league. The team continued to struggle with Smith eventually being reinserted into the lineup. The Jets went on to win two of their last three games to finish with a 4–12 record, their worst finish under Ryan. Despite players again expressing their desire for Ryan to remain the coach, he was dismissed on December 29, 2014.

Ryan was hired as the <a href="List%20of%20Buffalo%20Bills%20head%20coaches">18th head coach</a> of the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> on January 12, 2015, agreeing to a five-year, $27.5 million contract.

The Bills opened the <a href="2015%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2015 season</a> with a 27–14 win over the <a href="2015%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season">Indianapolis Colts</a>. Frustrated by the Bills leading the NFL in penalties heading into their Week 5 game against the <a href="2015%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season">Tennessee Titans</a>, Ryan gave the entire team wristbands with the message "Yes sir". These were the only words he wanted his players to use with officials if they were flagged. After being flagged 17 times in Week 4 loss against the <a href="2015%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a>, the Bills were penalized only seven times in their 14-13 victory over the Titans. The Bills entered their bye week with a 3–4 record after losing in <a href="London">London</a> to the <a href="2015%20Jacksonville%20Jaguars%20season">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>.

Ryan gave the whole team the week off during the bye, and he himself found a secluded beach to "get away and focus". The Bills came out of their bye week and defeated the <a href="2015%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season">Miami Dolphins</a> by a score of 33–17, improving their season record to 4–4. Ryan is now 2–5 all time following a bye week. Ryan returned to <a href="MetLife%20Stadium">MetLife Stadium</a> in Week 10 for a much anticipated "<a href="Thursday%20Night%20Football">Thursday Night Football</a>" game against the <a href="2015%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">Jets</a>. The Bills won the game by a score of 22–17, and improved to 5–4 on the season. Ryan faced questions before and after the game about his decision to name <a href="IK%20Enemkpali">IK Enemkpali</a>, who had been released by the Jets in preseason after breaking quarterback <a href="Geno%20Smith">Geno Smith</a>'s jaw in an altercation, as Buffalo's captain for the game.

The Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as coach, as they were eliminated in Week 15 with a 35–25 loss to the <a href="2015%20Washington%20Redskins%20season">Washington Redskins</a> on December 20, extending their drought to 16 seasons, the NFL's longest active drought. They finished the season with an 8–8 record.

On January 10, 2016, it was announced that Ryan had hired his twin brother. <a href="Rob%20Ryan">Rob</a>, to the Bills coaching staff. Rob served as an assistant head coach and also worked with the defense. Three days later, Ryan hired former NFL standout <a href="Ed%20Reed">Ed Reed</a> to be an assistant <a href="defensive%20back">defensive back</a>s coach.

The Bills opened the 2016 season with a 13–7 loss against the <a href="2016%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season">Baltimore Ravens</a>. On September 16, 2016, less than 24 hours after losing 37–31 to the <a href="2016%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">Jets</a> in their home opener and falling to 0–2, Ryan fired offensive coordinator <a href="Greg%20Roman">Greg Roman</a> and promoted running backs coach <a href="Anthony%20Lynn">Anthony Lynn</a> to offensive coordinator.

On December 27, after a <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> loss to the <a href="2016%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season">Miami Dolphins</a> in Week 16 that eliminated the team from playoff contention, Ryan was relieved of his duties as head coach, and offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn was named as interim head coach for the final game of the season. Rob Ryan was dismissed as well. Many players were unable to thrive under Ryan's defensive scheme, which was described as complicated. The Buffalo Bills' defense finished the 2016 season 15th in points allowed and 24th in rushing yards allowed. Following the season, Ryan went on a profane tirade against the team for allegedly quitting on him.

Following his dismissal from the Bills, Ryan signed an agreement with <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> to provide analysis for the network's <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a> pregame and postgame shows. The one-game agreement, in which ESPN beat out game rightsholder Fox (as well as CBS and NFL Network), left the possibility open for Ryan to continue with ESPN through the 2017 season. In April, it was announced that Ryan would officially join ESPN's "<a href="Sunday%20NFL%20Countdown">Sunday NFL Countdown</a>" as an analyst.

Ryan stresses that coaches are essentially supposed to be open and communicative with the players and management, who in turn will reciprocate the same attitude. By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's "valuable when it comes to figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." <a href="Fullback%20%28gridiron%20football%29">Fullback</a> <a href="Tony%20Richardson%20%28American%20football%29">Tony Richardson</a>, in an interview, stated Ryan "loves his football team, loves his players" and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to "[put] it on himself" so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, particularly when it comes to providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing."

With extensive knowledge regarding the intricacies of the defense, Ryan has been criticized for not devoting similar time and effort into coaching the offense. Ryan refuted this, stating his goal is to implement a proficient running game, citing a desire to "get after" the opponent through running the ball. Ryan has also stated that passing the ball is important but should not be used incessantly as there should be a balance between both aspects of the offense. In 2009 and 2010, the Jets were ranked first and fourth overall in the league in rushing which coincided with their two playoff appearances. In 2011, the Jets attempted to convert to a more pass-oriented offense, which have become more widely used in the NFL, however, the team struggled with this adjustment and reverted to their former run-oriented offense by the middle of the season. His defensive strategy, in contrast, tends to be more elaborate taking into consideration his experience in the field. There are six different defensive formations utilized in football, but the two commonly used formations are the <a href="3-4%20defense">3–4 formation</a>, with three defensive lineman and four linebackers, and the <a href="4-3%20defense">4–3 formation</a>, with four defensive lineman and three linebackers. The Jets utilized the former of the two popular formations; however, Ryan tended to employ all six formations in varying forms. Furthermore, he often calls <a href="Audible%20%28American%20football%29">audibles</a> that have the defense line up in one formation and switch to another so as to cloak their intentions and confuse and pressure the opponent.

As a testament to this philosophy, Ryan is often willing to defer the <a href="American%20football%23Start%20of%20halves">coin toss</a> to the opponent so his team can begin the game playing on defense in order to "set the tone" and generate <a href="Turnover%20%28gridiron%20football%29">turnovers</a>. This concept has been criticized by <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> reporter <a href="John%20Clayton%20%28sportscaster%29">John Clayton</a>, who has found the method to be ineffective league-wide. Mark Kriegel, an analyst for the <a href="NFL%20Network">NFL Network</a>, found that between 2005 and 2012, during his tenure with both the Ravens and Jets, Ryan's defenses have never been ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL and have allowed an average of 281 yards per game from <a href="Line%20of%20scrimmage">scrimmage</a>, second to <a href="Dick%20LeBeau">Dick LeBeau</a>'s 277.4 yards per game. LeBeau is generally regarded as one of the best defensive coordinators in the history of the NFL.

Ryan and his wife, Michelle, met at Southwestern Oklahoma State. When Rex accepted his position as a graduate assistant at Eastern Kentucky, he proposed to Michelle by phone; she accepted and they were married in 1987. They have two sons, <a href="Seth%20Ryan">Seth</a>, an assistant for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, and Payton. Ryan earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> and a <a href="Master%27s%20degree">Master's degree</a> in physical education from <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20University">Eastern Kentucky University</a>. He resided in <a href="Summit%2C%20New%20Jersey">Summit, New Jersey</a>, during his tenure with the Jets. As of 2017, he plans on residing in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.

Ryan publicly announced in 2009 that he had been battling <a href="dyslexia">dyslexia</a> for his entire life. During his early years, Ryan struggled to read and write in school; however, he was not formally diagnosed until testing confirmed he had the disorder in 2007. Ryan utilizes color-coded playbooks and game plans when coaching on the sidelines to aid his comprehension.

Ryan underwent <a href="Adjustable%20gastric%20band">lap-band surgery</a> at <a href="NYU%20Langone%20Medical%20Center">NYU Medical Center</a> in March 2010 in an effort to battle his <a href="obesity">obesity</a>. Ryan also had a <a href="hernia">hernia</a> repaired during the procedure. He was able to return to his home that same day to recover. Following a three-week period, he had lost 40 pounds and as of July 2012, Ryan had lost 106 pounds.

On September 13, 2016, it was revealed that Ryan underwent a procedure to remove the lap band. He lost a total of 120 pounds during the 6-year span since he had the surgery.

Ryan was involved in a <a href="traffic%20collision">three-car crash</a> in eastern <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> on January 14, 2013. A witness said Ryan ran his <a href="Ford%20Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> through a red light and collided with another driver which caused the unidentified driver to hit a third car. Ryan was issued a warning, but no citation.

Ryan released "Play Like You Mean It", an <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> and a conversational about football strategy. The book, which was published by <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday</a> in the spring of 2011, was co-written by Don Yaeger, a former "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" editor who has co-authored the autobiographies of former NFL players <a href="Walter%20Payton">Walter Payton</a> and <a href="Warren%20Moon">Warren Moon</a>.

Ryan made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> in the <a href="Adam%20Sandler">Adam Sandler</a> film "<a href="That%27s%20My%20Boy%20%282012%20film%29">That's My Boy</a>", which was released on June 15, 2012. Ironically, his character was a fan of the Jets' rival, the New England Patriots.

In late 2010 as the Jets were preparing for the playoffs, a <a href="foot%20fetish">foot fetish</a> video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having her bare feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named "ihaveprettyfeet" on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of him sitting at his desk with a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.

Ryan is an avid <a href="hockey">hockey</a> fan and developed a notoriety of being a <a href="bandwagon%20fan">bandwagon jumper</a>. Ryan admitted to being a fan of the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, as a result of growing up in the city, but upon taking the Jets head coaching job, he was often seen cheering for all three of the New York metropolitan area franchises. During the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> run to the <a href="2012%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">2012 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, Ryan was seen sporting the team's attire, and he was seen donning the attire of the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> two years later, during their run to the <a href="2014%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Final</a>. Outside of the playoff runs, Ryan performed a ceremonial puck drop at <a href="Nassau%20Veterans%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> on October 9, 2010, wearing a vintage <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> <a href="Billy%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Billy Smith</a> jersey.

Ryan was known for a notorious incident at a <a href="Carolina%20Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> game, as he attended the matchup with the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a> sporting a throwback <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> jersey on. Upon being recognized by the fans at the arena, the team's cheerleaders approached him with a Hurricanes alternate jersey sported by the team. The incident was noted as he was seen taking off the jersey and baring his chest for the crowd to see.

Upon taking the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> head coaching job, Ryan changed his allegiance to the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>, and he was often seen at the team's home games and sporting the team's attire. Months after being fired by the Bills, Ryan would later be seen during the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a> run to the <a href="2017%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">2017 Stanley Cup Final</a>, wearing the team's jersey.

On April 18, 2016, Ryan introduced <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202016">Republican presidential candidate</a> front-runner <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> at one of his rallies held at the <a href="First%20Niagara%20Center">First Niagara Center</a> in Buffalo, NY. Ryan told <a href="The%20Associated%20Press">The Associated Press</a> he was supporting <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a> for the nomination, but he dropped out of the race and has since endorsed Trump. During the rally, Ryan praised Trump's 'courage' to "say what's on his mind."

Sentence spacing

Sentence spacing is the <a href="Space%20%28punctuation%29">space</a> between sentences in <a href="typeset">typeset</a> <a href="Written%20language">text</a>. It is a matter of typographical <a href="convention%20%28norm%29">convention</a>. Since the introduction of <a href="movable%20type">movable-type</a> printing in Europe, various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a <a href="Latin%20script">Latin alphabet</a>. These include a normal <a href="word%20space">word space</a> (as between the words in a sentence), a single enlarged <a href="Space%20%28punctuation%29">space</a>, and two full spaces.

Until the 20th century, publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences. There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method—some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing. This was "<a href="History%20of%20sentence%20spacing%23French%20and%20English%20spacing">French spacing</a>"—a term synonymous with single-space sentence spacing until the late 20th century. With the introduction of the <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a> in the late 19th century, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters. While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid-20th century, the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers. Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter.

The desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable. From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers, and the majority of style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. The debate continues. Many people prefer double sentence spacing because that was how they were taught to type. There is a debate on which convention is more <a href="readability">readable</a>; the few recent direct <a href="%23Studies">studies</a> conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results. 

Shortly after the invention of movable type, highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even <a href="Justification%20%28typesetting%29">justification</a>. Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as "printers' rules") specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890) and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.—indicated that sentences should be <a href="Em%20%28typography%29">em</a>-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced. The relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs. For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses (notably in France) that used a standard word space between sentences—a technique called French spacing.

Mechanical type systems introduced near the end of the 19th century, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition. Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. But the typewriters' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing—typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar. Typists in some English-speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces, a practice that continued throughout the 20th century. This became known as English spacing, and marked a divergence from French typists, who continued to use French spacing.

In the early 20th century, some printers began using one and a half interword spaces (an "<a href="en%20quad">en quad</a>") to separate sentences. This standard continued in use, to some extent, into the 1990s.

Magazines, newspapers, and books began to adopt the single space convention in the United States in the 1940s and in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. Typists did not move to single spacing simultaneously. The average writer still relied on the typewriter to create text—with its mechanical spacing limitations.

Technological advances began affecting sentence spacing methods. In 1941, <a href="IBM">IBM</a> introduced the <a href="IBM%20Electric%20typewriter%23Executive">Executive</a>, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing—which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>, as <a href="HTML">HTML</a> normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the <a href="Cascading%20Style%20Sheets">CSS</a> 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools. By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing.

Early positions on <a href="typography">typography</a> (the "arrangement and appearance of text") supported traditional spacing techniques in English publications. In 1954, Geoffrey Dowding's book, "Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type", underscored the widespread shift from a single enlarged em space to a standard word space between sentences.

With the advent of the computer age, typographers began <a href="Deprecation">deprecating</a> double spacing, even in monospaced text. In 1989, "Desktop Publishing by Design" stated that "<a href="typesetting">typesetting</a> requires only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons", and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention. "Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works" (1993) and "Designing with Type: The Essential Guide to Typography" (2006) both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words, including between sentences.

More recent works on typography weigh in strongly. Ilene Strizver, founder of the Type Studio, says, "Forget about tolerating differences of opinion: typographically speaking, typing two spaces before the start of a new sentence is absolutely, unequivocally wrong." The "Complete Manual on Typography" (2003) states that "The typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting" and the single space is "standard typographic practice". The "Elements of Typographic Style" (2004) advocates a single space between sentences, noting that "your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint [double spacing] Victorian habit".

David Jury's book, "About Face: Reviving the Rules of Typography" (2004)—published in Switzerland—clarifies the contemporary typographic position on sentence spacing:

Word spaces, preceding or following punctuation, should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space. If a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type. This is because these punctuation marks carry space "above" them, which, when added to the adjacent standard word spaces, combines to create a visually larger space. Some argue that the "additional" space after a comma and full point serves as a "pause signal" for the reader. But this is unnecessary (and visually disruptive) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself.

Early <a href="style%20guide">style guide</a>s for typesetting used a wider space between sentences than between words—"traditional spacing", as shown in the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten <a href="manuscripts">manuscripts</a>, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. The 1969 edition of the "Chicago Manual of Style" used em spaces between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's "Hart's Rules" (1983) had shifted to single sentence spacing. Other style guides followed suit in the 1990s. Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences.

Modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language. These works are important to writers since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication". Late editions of comprehensive style guides, such as the <a href="Style%20guide%23United%20Kingdom">"Oxford Style Manual"</a> (2003) in the United Kingdom and "<a href="the%20Chicago%20Manual%20of%20Style">the Chicago Manual of Style</a>" (2010) in the United States, provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics, including sentence spacing. The majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications. A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the "Gregg Reference Manual" makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences. Web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as "HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether". These works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing.

The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s "Interinstitutional Style Guide" (2008) indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all European Union publications—encompassing <a href="Languages%20of%20the%20European%20Union%23Official%20EU%20languages">23 languages</a>. For the English language, the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>'s "English Style Guide" (2010) states that sentences are always single-spaced. The "Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers" (2007), first published in 1966 by the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth</a> Government Printing Office of Australia, stipulates that only one space is used after "sentence-closing punctuation" and that "Programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated, variable spacing, so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page."

National languages not covered by an authoritative <a href="List%20of%20language%20regulators">language academy</a> typically have multiple style guides—only some of which may discuss sentence spacing. This is the case in the United Kingdom. The "Oxford Style Manual" (2003) and the <a href="Modern%20Humanities%20Research%20Association">Modern Humanities Research Association</a>'s "MHRA Style Guide" (2002) state that only single spacing should be used. In Canada, both the English and French language sections of the "Canadian Style, A Guide to Writing and Editing" (1997), prescribe single sentence spacing. In the United States, many style guides—such as the "Chicago Manual of Style" (2003)—allow only single sentence spacing. The most important style guide in Italy, "Il Nuovo Manuale di Stile" (2009), does not address sentence spacing, but the "Guida di Stile Italiano" (2010), the official guide for Microsoft translation, tells users to use single sentence spacing "instead of the double spacing used in the United States".

Some languages, such as <a href="French%20language">French</a> and <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, have academies that set language rules. Their publications typically address <a href="orthography">orthography</a> and grammar as opposed to matters of typography. Style guides are less relevant for such <a href="Standard%20language">languages</a>, as their academies set <a href="Linguistic%20prescription">prescriptive rules</a>. For example, the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a> publishes the "<a href="Dictionnaire%20de%20l%27Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Dictionnaire de l'Académie française</a>" for French speakers worldwide. The 1992 edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing, but is single-sentence-spaced throughout—consistent with historical French spacing. The Spanish language is similar. The most important body within the <a href="Association%20of%20Spanish%20Language%20Academies">Association of Spanish Language Academies</a>, the <a href="Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Real Academia Española</a>, publishes the "<a href="Diccionario%20de%20la%20lengua%20espa%C3%B1ola%20de%20la%20Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Diccionario de la Lengua Española</a>", which is viewed as prescriptive for the Spanish language worldwide. The 2001 edition does not provide sentence spacing guidance, but is itself single sentence spaced. The German language manual "<a href="Rat%20f%C3%BCr%20deutsche%20Rechtschreibung">Empfehlungen des Rats für Deutsche Rechtschreibung</a>" ("Recommendations of the Council for German Orthography") (2006) does not address sentence spacing. The manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation. Additionally, the "<a href="Duden">Duden</a>", the German language dictionary most commonly used in Germany, indicates that double sentence spacing is an error.

A few reference grammars address sentence spacing, as increased spacing between words is punctuation in itself. Most do not. Grammar guides typically cover <a href="terminal%20punctuation">terminal punctuation</a> and the proper construction of sentences—but not the spacing between sentences. Moreover, many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference and refer users to comprehensive <a href="style%20guide">style guide</a>s for additional matters of writing style. For example, the "Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation" (2005) points users to style guides such as the "<a href="The%20MLA%20Style%20Manual">MLA Style Manual</a>" for consistency in formatting work and for all other "editorial concerns". The "Grammar Bible" (2004) states that "The modern system of English punctuation is by no means simple. A book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and anyone interested in such a resource is advised to consult the "Chicago Manual of Style"."

In the computer era, spacing between sentences is handled in several different ways by various software packages. Some systems accept whatever the user types, while others attempt to alter the spacing, or use the user input as a method of detecting sentences. Computer-based word processors, and <a href="typesetting">typesetting</a> <a href="software">software</a> such as <a href="troff">troff</a> and <a href="TeX">TeX</a>, allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters.

The text editing environment in <a href="Emacs">Emacs</a> uses a double space following a period to identify the end of sentences unambiguously; the double space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations. How Emacs recognizes the end of a sentence is controlled by the settings "sentence-end-double-space" and "sentence-end". The <a href="vi">vi</a> editor also follows this convention; thus, it is relatively easy to manipulate (jump over, copy, delete) whole sentences in both <a href="emacs">emacs</a> and <a href="vi">vi</a>.

The Unix typesetter program <a href="troff">troff</a> uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence. This allows the typesetter to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations and to typeset them differently. Early versions of troff, which only typeset in fixed width fonts, would automatically add a second space between sentences, which were detected based on the combination of terminal punctuation and a line feed.

<a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a> does not treat sentences differently by default, but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences.

<a href="TeX">TeX</a> typesets an "intersentence space" after a period unless the period follows a capital letter (as in initials) or it is instructed otherwise. This is a variable space that is normally wider than an "interword space".

On some modern touch-screen platforms, including Android and iOS, typing two spaces in a row is automatically interpreted to mean the end of a sentence, and a period is automatically inserted. However, only one space is retained.

Multiple spaces are eliminated by default in most World Wide Web content, whether or not they are associated with sentences. There are options for preserving spacing, such as the CSS white-space property, and the <pre> tag. Twitter retains extra spaces in user input on its website. HTML also includes several other space entities which are not collapsed, such as an em space, an en space, and a non-breaking space. Some <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> space characters are also not collapsed on the web.

James Felici, author of the "Complete Manual of Typography", says that the topic of sentence spacing is "the debate that refuses to die ... In all my years of writing about type, it's still the question I hear most often, and a search of the web will find threads galore on the subject." This subject is still widely debated today.

Many people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons. Some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change. Others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text. Proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double-spaced manuscript submissions from authors. A key example noted is the screenwriting industry's monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts, <a href="Courier%20%28typeface%29">Courier</a>, 12-point font, although some works on screenwriting indicate that Courier is merely preferred—proportional fonts may be used. Some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide, but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers' guidance takes precedence, including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts.

One of the most popular arguments against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter, and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.
However, proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter, and remained for decades after its invention. When the typewriter was first introduced, typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences. This gradually shifted to two spaces, while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em-spaced sentences. Some sources now state it is acceptable for monospaced fonts to be single spaced today, although other references continue to specify double spacing for monospaced fonts. The double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes, and that remains the practice in many cases. Some voice concern that students will later be forced to relearn how to type.

Most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today, and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication—single sentence spaced. Writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts, although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication.

In academic publications, <a href="Elsevier">Elsevier</a> uses French spacing but <a href="Springer%20Publishing">Springer</a> uses a wider space between sentences than between words.

Claims abound regarding the <a href="Typography%23Readability%20and%20legibility">legibility</a> and <a href="readability">readability</a> of the single and double sentence spacing methods—by proponents on both sides. Supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books, magazines, and the Web enhances readability, that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts, and that the "<a href="river%20%28typography%29">rivers</a>" and "holes" caused by double spacing impair readability. Proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible, particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma.

However, typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence. "Opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print", and when direct studies are conducted, anecdotal opinions—even those of experts—can turn out to be false. Text that seems legible (visually pleasing at first glance) may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study.

Direct studies on sentence spacing include those by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, and Ali (2002); Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, and Shewanown (2003); and Ni, Branch, and Chen (2004), with results favoring neither single, double, nor triple spacing. The 2002 study tested participants' reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on-screen text. The authors stated that "the 'double space group' consistently took longer time to finish than the 'single space' group" but concluded that "there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists". The 2003 and 2004 studies analyzed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. In both cases, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. Ni, Branch, Chen, and Clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables. The authors concluded that the "results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences". A 2018 study of 60 students found that those who used two word spaces between sentences read the same text 3 percent faster with a <a href="monospaced%20font">monospaced font</a> (<a href="Courier%20New">Courier New</a>).

The X-10 Graphite Reactor at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a> (after <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>'s <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>), and the first designed and built for continuous operation. It was built during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>.

While Chicago Pile-1 demonstrated the feasibility of nuclear reactors, the Manhattan Project's goal of producing enough <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> for <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s required reactors a thousand times as powerful, along with facilities to chemically separate the plutonium bred in the reactors from <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a>. An intermediate step was considered prudent. The next step for the plutonium project, codenamed X-10, was the construction of a <a href="wikt%3Asemi-works">semiworks</a> where techniques and procedures could be developed and training conducted. The centerpiece of this was the X-10 Graphite Reactor. It was air-cooled, used <a href="nuclear%20graphite">nuclear graphite</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>, and pure <a href="natural%20uranium">natural uranium</a> in metal form for fuel.

<a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> commenced construction of the plutonium semiworks at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor "went <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">critical</a>" on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the <a href="Hanford%20site">Hanford site</a>. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963 and was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1965.

The discovery of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> by German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a>, opened up the possibility of a controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> with <a href="uranium">uranium</a>. At <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> began exploring how this might be done. Szilard drafted a <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard%20letter">confidential letter</a> to the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, explaining the possibility of <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s, and warning of the danger of a <a href="German%20nuclear%20weapon%20project">German nuclear weapon project</a>. He convinced his old friend and collaborator <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into nuclear fission, which became the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>.

In April 1941, the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) asked <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, a <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel-Prize-winning</a> physics professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, to report on the uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing <a href="radiological%20weapon">radiological weapon</a>s, <a href="nuclear%20propulsion">nuclear propulsion</a> for ships, and <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> using <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> or the recently discovered <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a> had theorized that heavy isotopes with even <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s and odd number of neutrons were <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. If so, then <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> was likely to be.

<a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the <a href="thermal%20neutron">thermal neutron</a> capture <a href="Neutron%20cross%20section">cross section</a> of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but it was not possible to produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> how plutonium might be produced in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, and with <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.

The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, which was codenamed X-10. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated the work at the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> at the University of Chicago.

By June 1942, the Manhattan Project had reached the stage where the construction of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) <a href="S-1%20Executive%20Committee">S-1 Executive Committee</a> deliberated on where they should be located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>.

Compton selected a site in the <a href="Red%20Gate%20Woods">Argonne Forest</a>, part of the <a href="Forest%20Preserve%20District%20of%20Cook%20County">Forest Preserve District of Cook County</a>, about southwest of Chicago. The full-scale production facilities would be co-located with other Manhattan Project facilities at a still more remote location in Tennessee. Some of land was leased from <a href="Cook%20County">Cook County</a> for the pilot facilities, while an site for the production facilities was selected at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>. By the S-1 Executive Committee meeting on September 13 and 14, it had become apparent that the pilot facilities would be too extensive for the Argonne site, so instead a research reactor would be built at Argonne, while the plutonium pilot facilities (a <a href="wikt%3Asemi-works">semiworks</a>) would be built at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in Tennessee.

This site was selected on the basis of several criteria. The plutonium pilot facilities needed to be from the site boundary and any other installation, in case radioactive <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a> escaped. While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The <a href="stratum">substratum</a> needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It needed large amounts of electrical power (available from the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>) and cooling water. Finally, a <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra</a> or <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>s, east of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>, or within of the Canadian or Mexican borders.

In December, it was decided that the plutonium production facilities would not be built at Oak Ridge after all, but at the even more remote <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> in <a href="Washington%20state">Washington state</a>. Compton and the staff at the Metallurgical Laboratory then reopened the question of building the plutonium semiworks at Argonne, but the engineers and management of <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a>, particularly <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28chemist%29">Roger Williams</a>, the head of its TNX Division, which was responsible for the company's role in the Manhattan Project, did not support this proposal. They felt that there would be insufficient space at Argonne, and that there were disadvantages in having a site that was so accessible, as they were afraid that it would permit the research staff from the Metallurgical Laboratory to interfere unduly with the design and construction, which they considered their prerogative. A better location, they felt, would be with the remote production facilities at Hanford. In the end a compromise was reached. On January 12, 1943, Compton, Williams, and <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project, agreed that the semiworks would be built at the Clinton Engineer Works.

Both Compton and Groves proposed that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-proposed that the semiworks be operated by the Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to be found at the Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university would be operating an industrial facility from its main campus. <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a> told him that <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President <a href="Robert%20Maynard%20Hutchins">Robert Hutchins</a> returned, he greeted Compton with "I see, Arthur, that while I was gone you doubled the size of my university".

The fundamental design decisions in building a reactor are the choice of fuel, coolant and <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. The choice of fuel was straightforward; only natural uranium was available. The decision that the reactor would use <a href="graphite">graphite</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a> caused little debate. Although with <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> as moderator the number of neutrons produced for every one absorbed (known as "k") was 10 percent more than in the purest graphite, heavy water would be unavailable in sufficient quantities for at least a year. This left the choice of coolant, over which there was much discussion. A limiting factor was that the fuel slugs would be clad in aluminum, so the operating temperature of the reactor could not exceed . The theoretical physicists in Wigner's group at the Metallurgical Laboratory developed several designs. In November 1942, the DuPont engineers chose <a href="helium">helium</a> gas as the coolant for the production plant, mainly on the basis that it did not absorb neutrons, but also because it was inert, which removed the issue of corrosion.

Not everyone agreed with the decision to use helium. Szilard, in particular, was an early proponent of using liquid <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>; but the major opponent was Wigner, who argued forcefully in favor of a water-cooled reactor design. He realized that since water absorbed neutrons, "k" would be reduced by about 3 percent, but had sufficient confidence in his calculations that the water-cooled reactor would still be able to achieve criticality. From an engineering perspective, a water-cooled design was straightforward to design and build, while helium posed technological problems. Wigner's team produced a preliminary report on water cooling, designated CE-140 in April 1942, followed by a more detailed one, CE-197, titled "On a Plant with Water Cooling", in July 1942.

Fermi's <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a> reactor, constructed under the west viewing stands of the original <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a> at the University of Chicago, "went <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">critical</a>" on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that "k" was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified other aspects of the design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.

Although the design of the reactor was not yet complete, DuPont began construction of the plutonium semiworks on February 2, 1943, on an isolated site in the Bethel Valley about southwest of Oak Ridge officially known as the X-10 area. The site included research laboratories, a chemical separation plant, a waste storage area, a training facility for Hanford staff, and administrative and support facilities that included a laundry, cafeteria, first aid center, and fire station. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot. The semiworks eventually became known as the Clinton Laboratories, and was operated by the University of Chicago as part of the Metallurgical Project.
Construction work on the reactor had to wait until DuPont had completed the design. Excavation commenced on April 27, 1943. A large pocket of soft clay was soon discovered, necessitating additional foundations. Further delays occurred due to wartime difficulties in procuring building materials. There was an acute shortage of both common and skilled labor; the contractor had only three-quarters of the required workforce, and there was high turnover and absenteeism, mainly the result of poor accommodations and difficulties in commuting. The township of Oak Ridge was still under construction, and barracks were built to house workers. Special arrangements with individual workers increased their morale and reduced turnover. Finally, there was unusually heavy rainfall, with falling in July 1943, more than twice the average of .

Some of graphite blocks were purchased from <a href="National%20Carbon%20Company">National Carbon</a>. The construction crews began stacking them in September 1943. Cast uranium <a href="Semi-finished%20casting%20products">billets</a> came from Metal Hydrides, <a href="Mallinckrodt">Mallinckrodt</a> and other suppliers. These were extruded into cylindrical slugs, and then canned. The fuel slugs were canned to protect the uranium metal from <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> that would occur if it came into contact with water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen as it transmitted heat well but did not absorb too many neutrons. <a href="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> started canning on June 14, 1943. <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new welding technique to seal the cans airtight, and the equipment for this was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943.

Construction commenced on the pilot separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. Not until May 1943 would DuPont managers decide to use the <a href="bismuth%20phosphate%20process">bismuth phosphate process</a> in preference to one using lanthanum fluoride. The bismuth phosphate process was devised by <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Thompson">Stanley G. Thompson</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a>. Plutonium had two oxidation states; a <a href="tetravalent">tetravalent</a> (+4) state, and <a href="hexavalent">hexavalent</a> (+6) state, with different chemical properties. Bismuth phosphate () was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate, and plutonium would be carried with bismuth phosphate in a solution while other elements, including uranium, would be precipitated. The plutonium could be switched from being in solution to being precipitated by toggling its oxidation state. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated from the control room by remote control due to the radioactivity produced by <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a>. Work was completed on November 26, 1943, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs.

The X-10 Graphite Reactor was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor after Chicago Pile-1, and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. It consisted of a huge block, long on each side, of <a href="nuclear%20graphite">nuclear graphite</a> cubes, weighing around , that acted as a moderator. They were surrounded by of high-density concrete as a radiation shield. In all, the reactor was wide, deep and high. There were 36 horizontal rows of 35 holes. Behind each was a metal channel into which uranium fuel slugs could be inserted. An elevator provided access to those higher up. Only 800 (~64%) of the channels were ever used.

The reactor used <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>-clad steel <a href="control%20rods">control rods</a>. Made from neutron-absorbing cadmium, these could restrict or halt the reaction. Three rods penetrated the reactor vertically, held in place by a clutch to form the <a href="scram">scram</a> system. They were suspended from steel cables that were wound around a drum, and held in place by an electromagnetic <a href="clutch">clutch</a>. If power was lost, they would drop into the reactor, halting it. The other four rods were made of <a href="boron">boron</a> steel and horizontally penetrated the reactor from the north side. Two of them, known as "shim" rods, were hydraulically controlled. Sand-filled <a href="hydraulic%20accumulator">hydraulic accumulator</a>s could be used in the event of a power failure. The other two rods were driven by electric motors.

The cooling system consisted of three electric fans running at . Because it was cooled using outside air, the reactor could be run at a higher power level on cold days. After going through the reactor, the air was filtered to remove radioactive particles larger than in diameter. This took care of over 99 percent of the radioactive particles. It was then vented through a chimney. The reactor was operated from a control room in the southeast corner on the second floor.

In September 1942, Compton asked a physicist, <a href="Martin%20D.%20Whitaker">Martin D. Whitaker</a>, to form a skeleton operating staff for X-10. Whitaker became the inaugural director of the Clinton Laboratories, as the semiworks became officially known in April 1943. The first permanent operating staff arrived from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1943, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site. They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Army's <a href="Special%20Engineer%20Detachment">Special Engineer Detachment</a>. By March 1944, there were some 1,500 people working at X-10.
Supervised by Compton, Whitaker, and Fermi, the reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, with about of uranium. A week later the load was increased to , raising its power generation to 500 kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created. The reactor normally operated around the clock, with 10-hour weekly shutdowns for refueling. During startup, the safety rods and one shim rod were completely removed. The other shim rod was inserted at a predetermined position. When the desired power level was reached, the reactor was controlled by adjusting the partly inserted shim rod.

The first batch of canned slugs to be irradiated was received on December 20, 1943, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. The slugs used pure metallic <a href="natural%20uranium">natural uranium</a>, in air-tight aluminum cans long and in diameter. Each channel was loaded with between 24 and 54 fuel slugs. The reactor went critical with of slugs, but in its later life was operated with as much as . To load a channel, the radiation-absorbing shield plug was removed, and the slugs inserted manually in the front (east) end with long rods. To unload them, they were pushed all the way through to the far (west) end, where they fell onto a <a href="neoprene">neoprene</a> slab and fell down a chute into a pool of water that acted as a radiation shield. Following weeks of underwater storage to allow for <a href="Radioactive%20decay">decay in radioactivity</a>, the slugs were delivered to the chemical separation building.
By February 1944, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000 kW in July 1944. The effect of the <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a> <a href="xenon-135">xenon-135</a>, one of many <a href="fission%20product">fission product</a>s produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused problems with the startup of the Hanford <a href="B%20reactor">B reactor</a> that nearly halted the plutonium project.

The X-10 semiworks operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed. A radioisotope building, a steam plant, and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December 1946, adding another $1,009,000 to the cost of construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000.

X-10 supplied the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> with the first significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by <a href="Emilio%20G.%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio G. Segrè</a> and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities in the form of the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>, which has a far higher <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium <a href="gun-type%20nuclear%20weapon">gun-type nuclear weapon</a> would <a href="predetonation">predetonate</a> and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an <a href="implosion-type%20nuclear%20weapon">implosion-type nuclear weapon</a>—a far more difficult feat.

The X-10 chemical separation plant also verified the bismuth-phosphate process that was used in the full-scale separation facilities at Hanford. Finally, the reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the <a href="Hanford%20site">Hanford site</a>.

After the war ended, the graphite reactor became the first facility in the world to produce radioactive isotopes for peacetime use. On August 2, 1946, <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> director Eugene Wigner presented a small container of <a href="carbon-14">carbon-14</a> to the director of the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, for medical use at the hospital in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Subsequent shipments of radioisotopes, primarily <a href="iodine-131">iodine-131</a>, <a href="phosphorus-32">phosphorus-32</a>, carbon-14, and molybdenum-99/<a href="technetium-99m">technetium-99m</a>, were for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.

The X-10 Graphite Reactor was shut down on November 4, 1963, after twenty years of use. It was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on December 21, 1965, and added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on October 15, 1966. In 1969 the <a href="American%20Society%20for%20Metals">American Society for Metals</a> listed it as a landmark for its contributions to the advancement of <a href="materials%20science">materials science</a> and technology, and in 2008 it was designated as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Chemical%20Landmark">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> by the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a>. The control room and reactor face are accessible to the public during scheduled tours offered through the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Energy">American Museum of Science and Energy</a>.

The <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> (BNL) Graphite Research Reactor was the first nuclear reactor to be constructed in the United States following World War II. Led by <a href="Lyle%20Benjamin%20Borst">Lyle Benjamin Borst</a>, the reactor construction began in 1947 and reached criticality for the first time on August 22, 1950. The reactor consisted of a , cube of graphite fueled by natural uranium. Its primary mission was applied nuclear research in medicine, biology, chemistry, physics and nuclear engineering. One of the most significant discoveries at this facility was the development of production of <a href="molybdenum-99">molybdenum-99</a>/technetium-99m, used today in tens of millions of medical diagnostic procedures annually, making it the most commonly used medical radioisotope. The BNL Graphite Research Reactor was shut down in 1969 and fully decommissioned in 2012.

When Britain began planning to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, it was decided to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at <a href="Windscale">Windscale</a>. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly, graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because <a href="beryllia">beryllia</a> was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic <a href="nuclear%20meltdown">nuclear meltdown</a> in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 <a href="McMahon%20Act">McMahon Act</a>, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous <a href="Windscale%20fire">Windscale fire</a> in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on <a href="Magnox">Magnox</a> and <a href="Advanced%20gas-cooled%20reactor">AGR</a> designs used <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> instead.

Scarlet myzomela

The scarlet myzomela or scarlet honeyeater ("Myzomela sanguinolenta") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the honeyeater family <a href="Meliphagidae">Meliphagidae</a> native to Australia. It was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801. At long, it is the smallest honeyeater in Australia. It has a short tail and relatively long down-curved bill. It is <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>; the male is a striking bright red with black wings, while the female is entirely brown. It is more vocal than most honeyeaters, and a variety of calls have been recorded, including a bell-like tinkling.

The scarlet myzomela is found along most of the eastern coastline, from <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York</a> in the far north to <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> in the southern parts of its range, with populations moving north in the winter. Its natural <a href="habitat">habitat</a> is forest, where it forages mainly in the upper <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">tree canopy</a>. It is <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a>, feeding on insects as well as nectar. Up to three broods may be raised over the course of a breeding season. The female lays two or rarely three flecked white eggs in a diameter cup-shaped nest high in a tree. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed it as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a> on account of its large range and apparently stable population.

The scarlet myzomela was depicted in three paintings in a set of early illustrations known as the Watling drawings, done in the first years of European settlement of Sydney between 1788 and 1794. Based on these, English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> described it as three separate species in 1801. He based the description of "Certhia sanguinolenta" on an immature male <a href="Moulting%23In%20birds">moulting</a> into adult plumage with incomplete red colouration, calling it the sanguineous creeper. In the same publication he described "Certhia dibapha", the cochineal creeper, and "C. erythropygia", the red-rumped creeper. English naturalist <a href="James%20Francis%20Stephens">James Francis Stephens</a> called it "Meliphaga sanguinea" in 1826 as a replacement name for Latham's "Certhia sanguinolenta". <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> determined Latham's three names to be the one species in 1843, adopting the first-written binomial name as the valid one and relegating the others to synonymy, though the name "Myzomela dibapha" was occasionally used, particularly in <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>. In 1990, Ian McAllan proposed that the first drawing did not confirm the species identity and proposed the name "Myzomela dibapha" to hence be the oldest validly published name, however <a href="Richard%20Schodde">Richard Schodde</a> countered in 1992 that the drawing of an immature male could not be of any other species, meaning that "M. sanguinolenta" should stand. He added that the alternative proposed name had not been in use since the 1850s. The <a href="Wakolo%20myzomela">Wakolo myzomela</a>, <a href="Sulawesi%20myzomela">Sulawesi myzomela</a>, <a href="Banda%20myzomela">Banda myzomela</a>, and <a href="New%20Caledonian%20myzomela">New Caledonian myzomela</a> were all previously considered to be <a href="Biological%20specificity">conspecific</a> with the scarlet myzomela. There are no recognized subspecies nor regional variations; differences in observed plumage are due to wear after moulting.

This species is commonly known as the scarlet honeyeater in Australia and scarlet myzomela elsewhere, the latter name being adopted as the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (<a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">IOC</a>). Gould used Latham's name of sanguineous honeyeater in the 19th century, which persisted into the early 20th century. Other common names are soldier-bird (as the male appears to wear a red coat) and blood-bird. An early colonial name was little soldier.

A 2004 <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> study of <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of honeyeaters found the scarlet myzomela to be most closely related to the <a href="cardinal%20myzomela">cardinal myzomela</a>, with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that led to the <a href="red-headed%20myzomela">red-headed myzomela</a>, although only five of the thirty members of the genus "Myzomela" were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the scarlet myzomela diverged from that of the Banda myzomela around 2 million years ago, but the relationships of many species within the genus are uncertain. <a href="Molecule">Molecular</a> analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the <a href="Pardalotidae">Pardalotidae</a> (pardalotes), <a href="Acanthizidae">Acanthizidae</a> (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the <a href="Maluridae">Maluridae</a> (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large <a href="superfamily%20%28zoology%29">superfamily</a>, the <a href="Meliphagoidea">Meliphagoidea</a>.

The smallest honeyeater native to Australia, the scarlet myzomela is a distinctive bird with a compact body, short tail and relatively long down-curved black bill and dark brown iris. It is between long, with an average <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> of and a weight of . It has relatively long wings for its size; when the wings are folded, the longest primary feathers reach over half the length of the tail. It exhibits <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, with the male much more brightly coloured than the female. The adult male has a bright red (scarlet) head, nape and upper breast, with a narrow black stripe from beak to eye and a thin black eye-ring. The red plumage extends as a central stripe down the back and rump. On its breast, the red becomes more mottled with grey towards the belly and flanks, which are grey-white. The sides of the breast are brown-black. The <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a> and <a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20in%20bird%20topography%23Plumage%20features">scapulars</a> are black and the upperwing a dull black, with white edges to the secondary <a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s. The tail is black above and dark grey below. The underwing is white with a dark grey trailing edge and tip. The female has a brown head and neck, darker on top and lighter and greyer on the sides, with a pale grey-brown throat and chin. It sometimes has pinkish or reddish patches on the forehead, throat and cheeks. The upperparts are brown, sometimes with scarlet patches on the uppertail coverts. The tail is blackish-brown with yellow fringes to all but the central pair of <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">retrices</a>. The wings are blackish-brown. The female has a yellowish or brownish base to its black bill. Moulting takes place over spring and summer.

Young birds have juvenile plumage when they leave the nest; they are similar to females though with more reddish brown upperparts, light brown rumps and uppertail coverts. Immature males, after moulting from juvenile plumage, have patches of red feathers coming through the juvenile brown plumage. Immature females are very difficult to distinguish from juveniles or adult females. Both sexes attain adult plumage after two moults. It is unknown whether its plumage changes with moults after the scarlet myzomela attains adulthood.

The scarlet myzomela is more commonly heard than seen, and has a wider repertoire of notes in its calls than most honeyeaters. The male is more vocal than the female. The main call is a tuneful tinkling call made up of sets of six notes that rise or fall in tone. It has been likened to cork being rubbed on glass. The female chirps as it hops around and upon meeting and playing with the male, and it can also make a squeaking call. Both sexes make a short "chiew-chiew" as a contact call.

Males could be mistaken for the similar looking red-headed myzomela in eastern <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> in northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> where their ranges overlap, though the latter's red colouration is restricted to the head and is sharply demarcated. The latter species also lives in mangroves rather than woodlands. The <a href="dusky%20myzomela">dusky myzomela</a> resembles the female scarlet myzomela, but is larger with a longer bill and tail, has much darker brown plumage, and lacks the pink tinge to the face and throat.

The scarlet myzomela is found from <a href="Cooktown%2C%20Queensland">Cooktown</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a> down the east coast to <a href="Mitchell%20River%20National%20Park%20%28Victoria%29">Mitchell River National Park</a> in <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a>, Victoria. It is rarer south of the <a href="Hacking%20River">Hacking River</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. Its range extends inland to <a href="Charters%20Towers">Charters Towers</a>, <a href="Carnarvon%20Gorge">Carnarvon Gorge</a> and <a href="Inglewood%2C%20Queensland">Inglewood</a> in Queensland, and the <a href="Warrumbungles">Warrumbungles</a> in New South Wales. It is a rare vagrant to Melbourne.

The species' movements are not well known, but it appears to be <a href="Bird%20migration">migratory</a> in the southern part of its range and more sedentary in the north. Populations of scarlet myzomelas move northwards up a portion of the Australian east coast for winter. Nomadic movements of populations, generally following the flowering of preferred food plants, also occur. Population numbers have been reported as fluctuating in some areas, with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred food plants. Local <a href="Irruptive%20growth">irruptions</a> have occurred in Sydney in 1902 (during a drought), 1981, 1991 (both in northwestern Sydney), and 1994 (centred on Lane Cove River valley), in <a href="Nowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nowra</a> in 1980, across southern Victoria in 1985, and in the <a href="Eurobodalla%20Shire">Eurobodalla</a> district in 1991 and 1993. A field study in <a href="Mangerton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mangerton</a> over 18 years found that scarlet myzomelas arrived in the area in early Spring (August) and left by November, though were entirely absent in three separate years. The maximum age recorded from <a href="Bird%20ringing">banding</a> has been just over 10 years, in a bird caught south of <a href="Mount%20Cotton%2C%20Queensland">Mount Cotton</a> in Queensland.

Its habitat is dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and woodland, generally with <a href="eucalypts">eucalypts</a> as the dominant trees and where there is little <a href="understory">understory</a>. Scarlet myzomelas are encountered alone, in pairs, or in small troops, sometimes with other honeyeaters in the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of trees in flower.

The scarlet myzomela is territorial, with males advertising their territories by singing from the tops of trees. They compete with members of the same species, and are usually driven away from some feeding areas by hungry larger honeyeaters, such as <a href="Lewin%27s%20honeyeater">Lewin's</a>, <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland</a>, <a href="White-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped</a>, and <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown</a> honeyeaters, as well as <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a>s and <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a>s. Breeding New Holland honeyeaters drive off scarlet myzomelas.

The species breeds from winter through to summer, generally beginning around July or August and winding up in January. There have been odd records of nesting in April or May. A pair generally raises one or two broods a year. Nest failures may lead to a third brood, with females able to lay eggs around three weeks after the previous young have <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d. The nest consists of a tiny cup of shredded bark with spider web as binding, high up in tree canopy, or even in <a href="Loranthaceae">mistletoe</a>. Trees with dense foliage, such as lillypilly ("<a href="Syzygium%20smithii">Syzygium smithii</a>"), "<a href="Pittosporum">Pittosporum</a>" species, turpentine ("Syncarpia glomulifera"), mangroves, species of paperbark, eucalypts or wattles ("<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" spp.) are more often chosen as nesting sites.

The nest is around in diameter, and takes around 8 days to build before eggs are laid in it. Both sexes build the nest, though some observations have the male doing the bulk of construction and others the female. <a href="Alfred%20John%20North">Alfred J. North</a> observed that the females alone collected nesting material, such as spiderwebs and bark, tearing bark off such trees as the rough-barked apple ("<a href="Angophora%20floribunda">Angophora floribunda</a>"). The clutch size is mostly two but occasionally three eggs. Measuring long and wide, the small eggs are white with the larger end flecked with dull red-brown or grey-purple. Eggs are laid a day apart, and the female is thought to <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs alone. The young are born naked, but are soon covered in down. They spend 11–12 days in the nest before fledging. Both parents feed their young.

The scarlet myzomela is <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>, foraging in the crowns of trees, darting from flower to flower, probing for nectar with its long curved bill. It sometimes hovers in front of flowers while feeding. Trees visited include turpentine ("<a href="Syncarpia%20glomulifera">Syncarpia glomulifera</a>"), paperbarks ("<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>" spp.), and <a href="banksias">banksias</a>. The scarlet myzomela is <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a>, and also feeds on insects as well as nectar, <a href="Hawking%20%28birds%29">sallying</a> for flying insects in the canopy. Insects eaten include beetles, flies, bugs, and caterpillars.

The scarlet myzomela is listed as being a <a href="least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, on account of its large range (1,960,000 square km) and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline.

Scarlet myzomelas are rarely seen in aviculture, though have been kept by enthusiasts in Sydney. As all honeyeaters are territorial, they tend to be aggressive in mixed-species aviaries. Various state regulations govern the keeping of the species; in South Australia, for instance, a Specialist Licence is required, while in New South Wales a Class B2 (Advanced Bird) licence is required. Applicants for the New South Wales B2 licence must have at least 2 years' experience keeping birds, and be able to demonstrate that they can provide the appropriate care and housing for the species they wish to obtain.

Yellow-faced honeyeater

The yellow-faced honeyeater ("Caligavis chrysops") is a medium-small bird in the <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, Meliphagidae. It takes both its common name and scientific name from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and south eastern Australia, in open <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude <a href="Subalpine%20zone">subalpine areas</a>, and <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants such as "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" and "<a href="Grevillea">Grevillea</a>", and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleaning</a> them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.

While some yellow-faced honeyeaters are <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a>, hundreds of thousands <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and return in July and August to breed in southern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. They form <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">socially monogamous</a> pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate <a href="cup%20nest">cup-shaped nest</a>. While the success rate can be low, the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.

Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land clearing, grazing, and weeds. However, as it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) to be of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.

The yellow-faced honeyeater was first <a href="species%20description">described</a>, and placed in the genus "<a href="Typical%20warbler">Sylvia</a>", by ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in his 1801 work "Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae". French ornithologist <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> described it as "Melithreptus gilvicapillus" in 1817, and English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> as "Ptilotis trivirgata" in 1869. The specific name "chrysops" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words meaning "gold" and "face", in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.

The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera "<a href="Meliphaga">Meliphaga</a>" and then "<a href="Lichenostomus">Lichenostomus</a>" until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense <a href="taxon">taxon</a> and <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> sampling confirmed previous findings that "Lichenostomus" is not <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>. While five species have previously been described as comprising the "Caligavis" subgroup, studies using the <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the <a href="black-throated%20honeyeater">black-throated honeyeater</a> ("C. subfrenatus") and the <a href="obscure%20honeyeater">obscure honeyeater</a> ("C. obscurus") of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus "<a href="Caligavis">Caligavis</a>". The <a href="bridled%20honeyeater">bridled honeyeater</a> ("B. frenatus") and the <a href="Eungella%20honeyeater">Eungella honeyeater</a> ("B. hindwoodi") were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as "<a href="Bolemoreus">Bolemoreus</a>". A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two "Caligavis" species around seven million years ago.

There are three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, two described by <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> in 1912. There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and "C. c. samueli" found in the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and "C. c. barroni" from <a href="Clarke%20Range">Clarke Range</a> and the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly not worthy of recognition" by the "<a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">Handbook of the Birds of the World</a>".

Surgeon-General to the <a href="First%20Fleet">First Fleet</a> <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">John White</a> caught a specimen in May 1788, calling it a yellow-faced flycatcher in his "Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales", which was published in 1790. Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler. <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848, which has become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.

The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head. Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the <a href="Beak%23Gape">gape</a>, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the <a href="Covert%20feather%23Ear%20coverts">ear coverts</a>. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive green outer edges on the <a href="Flight%20feather">remiges</a> combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages in length, with a wingspan of and a weight of between (average ).

One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like "chick-up, chick-up", from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long "preet" with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a>s, are animated two-note calls variously described as "terric, terric", "cr-rook, cr-rook" or "put-put, put-put".

Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats—in open <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian</a> woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum ("<a href="Corymbia%20maculata">Corymbia maculata</a>") with <a href="ironbark">ironbark</a>s and <a href="stringybark">stringybark</a>s such as narrow-leaved ironbark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20crebra">Eucalyptus crebra</a>") and silver-leaved ironbark (<a href="Eucalyptus%20melanophloia">"E. melanophloia"</a>), with a light shrubby <a href="understorey">understorey</a>, and less often in dry open forests and <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s dominated by "<a href="Angophora">Angophora</a>", "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>", "<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>" or "<a href="Callitris">Callitris</a>", or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20delegatensis">Eucalyptus delegatensis</a>") and woodlands dominated by snow gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pauciflora">E. pauciflora</a>") or white box ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20albens">E. albens</a>"). It has been recorded in coastal <a href="heath">heath</a> when banksias are blooming, and among flowering <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom ("<a href="Cytisus%20scoparius">Cytisus scoparius</a>") and <a href="Blackberry">blackberries</a>, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">fire</a> or <a href="logging">logging</a>, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an <a href="understory">understory</a> of sclerophyll plants.

The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc from near <a href="Cooktown">Cooktown</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a>, south west between a line from <a href="Charters%20Towers">Charters Towers</a> to <a href="Albury">Albury</a> and the coast, and then west to the <a href="Fleurieu%20Peninsula">Fleurieu Peninsula</a> and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near <a href="Armidale">Armidale</a> in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at <a href="Tarnagulla%2C%20Victoria">Tarnagulla, Victoria</a>. During the winter months of June and July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following northward migration.

While there are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, it is for the most part a <a href="season">season</a>al, <a href="Latitude">latitudinal</a>, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May) it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1,000 or more birds. The groups can include other species such as the <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped honeyeater</a>, <a href="fuscous%20honeyeater">fuscous honeyeater</a>, <a href="noisy%20friarbird">noisy friarbird</a> and <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a>. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales over the course of a single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">geomagnetic fields</a> and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments where the vertical component of the <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> was reversed indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the <a href="Magnet">field lines</a> and not on <a href="Magnet">polarity</a>, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and poles, rather than north and south. While their flight is in one general direction, it is not in a straight line as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges and detour around cities.

The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.

The yellow-faced honeyeater is usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds, and during migration in larger groups. They sometimes feed in large <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s composed predominately of insectivorous birds.

Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater is thought to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet consists of <a href="nectar">nectar</a>, <a href="pollen">pollen</a>, fruit, seeds, <a href="Honeydew%20%28secretion%29">honeydew</a>, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a>s, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleaning</a>, and by <a href="Hawking%20%28birds%29">sallying</a> or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily <a href="Diptera">Diptera</a> (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="spider">spider</a>s. A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20marginata">Banksia marginata</a>"), 61% from heath-leaved banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">Banksia ericifolia</a>"), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">Banksia oblongifolia</a>"), mountain devil ("<a href="Lambertia%20formosa">Lambertia formosa</a>") and green spider flower ("<a href="Grevillea%20mucronulata">Grevillea mucronulata</a>").

In April and May, before the autumn migration, the yellow-faced honeyeater increases its nectar consumption, which increases its body mass. The average body mass in late autumn of is 13% higher than the average recorded between January and April, and the yellow-faced honeyeater begins the migration with healthy fat reserves.

The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> pairs in a breeding season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> that both parents defend against conspecifics and other species including <a href="Acanthiza">thornbill</a>s, <a href="spinebill">spinebill</a>s, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within a breeding season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. <a href="Bird%20ringing">Banded</a> birds have been identified in the same territory for periods of up to five years.

The nest is built in the understorey shrubs, relatively close to the ground. Nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma ("<a href="Coprosma%20quadrifida">Coprosma quadrifida</a>"), "<a href="Cassinia">Cassinia</a>", tea-trees ("<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>"), <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>s, and <a href="acacia">acacia</a>s, as well as in garden shrubs. The nest is a fragile, cup-shaped structure, swollen at the sides and narrower at the rim. The female builds the nest, but is often accompanied by the male as she gathers nesting material. Most nests are built of greenish material which varies with the location; in coastal areas grass is the primary material, while in mountain forests the nest is often covered with moss. One bird was recorded repeatedly flying between the nest and a <a href="koala">koala</a> away and plucking the long hair near its ears to incorporate in the nest. The nests are very fine, with the eggs visible through the gauze-like walls, and they sometimes fall apart. They have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings falling through the bottom.

The female undertakes the <a href="avian%20incubation">incubation</a> alone. Eggs are oval, approximately long and wide, and pinkish white in colour with spots and blotches of dark reddish brown. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size varies from one to three eggs, and eggs take around two weeks to hatch. Upon hatching, both parents feed the nestlings and remove <a href="Feces">faecal pellets</a>. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> after thirteen days, and leave the parental territory after a further two weeks. The success rate can be as low as 16% of eggs developing into fledged young, with nest failure, hot weather, heavy rain, human activity (including fungicide spraying and nest damage), egg destruction by <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>s, and <a href="predation">predation</a> by <a href="Pseudonaja">brown snake</a>s, cats and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s all recorded as contributing to brood failure. Among the species that parasitize the nests of yellow-faced honeyeaters are <a href="fan-tailed%20cuckoo">fan-tailed cuckoo</a>s, <a href="brush%20cuckoo">brush cuckoo</a>s, <a href="pallid%20cuckoo">pallid cuckoo</a>s, <a href="shining%20bronze%20cuckoo">shining bronze cuckoo</a>s, and <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">Horsfield's bronze cuckoo</a>s. The yellow-faced honeyeater promptly nests again after both successful and failed breeding attempts.

A paternity analysis of yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity in the case of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a> is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and to sexual <a href="Monomorphism%20%28biology%29">monomorphism</a>; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.

Several <a href="Parasitism">ectoparasites</a> which can affect both survival and reproductive fitness have been found on the yellow-faced honeyeater; the mites <a href="Rhinonyssidae">"Ptilonyssus meliphagae"</a> and "Ptilonyssus thymanzae" and "<a href="Ixodes">Ixodes</a>" species ticks.

In general, honeyeaters require extensive <a href="Wildlife%20corridor">corridors</a> of mature trees along their migratory routes, and flowering woodlands for nesting, so they are vulnerable to the effects of land clearing, grazing and weed infestation. The woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community. However, as it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> to be of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> for conservation. A field experiment to determine whether yellow-faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper within the forest. While the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants, experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no increase in the number of avian predators at the forest edge. The experiment results do not support the "<a href="ecological%20trap">ecological trap</a>" and "predator influx" theories and contribute to a belief that <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">fragmented habitats</a> may not be as problematic as previously thought. In some areas the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit.

George Andrew Davis Jr.

George Andrew Davis Jr. (December 1, 1920 – February 10, 1952) was a highly decorated <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a> and <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and later of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Davis rose to the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>, and was promoted posthumously to <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> and awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his actions in "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>" during the latter war. He was the only flying ace of the United States to be <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> in Korea.

Born in <a href="Dublin%2C%20Texas">Dublin, Texas</a>, Davis joined the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> in early 1942. He was sent to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific Theatre</a> after pilot training and flew in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea</a> and <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%931945%29">Philippine campaigns</a>, scoring seven victories over <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> aircraft. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled pilot and accurate gunner whose "daredevil" flying style contrasted with his reserved personality.

Davis did not see action in Korea until late 1951. In spite of this, he achieved considerable success flying the <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre fighter jet</a>, quickly rising to become the war's <a href="List%20of%20aces%20of%20aces">ace of aces</a> and downing fourteen <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n, <a href="China">Chinese</a>, and <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> aircraft before his death in February 1952. During his final combat mission in northwest Korea, Davis surprised and attacked twelve Chinese <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15 fighter jets</a> about to attack friendly aircraft in "MiG Alley", downing two of the MiG-15's before he was shot down and killed. Controversies arose surrounding the circumstances of his death.

Davis is the fourth-highest US scoring ace of the Korean War with a total of 21 victories. He is one of seven US military pilots to become an ace in two wars, and one of 31 US pilots to be credited with more than 20 victories.

Davis was born in <a href="Dublin%2C%20Texas">Dublin, Texas</a>, on December 1, 1920. He was the seventh of nine children born to George Davis Sr. and Pearl Love Davis. In his childhood, Davis briefly lived in <a href="Maple%2C%20Bailey%20County%2C%20Texas">Maple, Texas</a>. Davis attended <a href="Morton%20High%20School%20%28Texas%29">Morton High School</a> in <a href="Morton%2C%20Texas">Morton, Texas</a>. Davis then attended <a href="Harding%20College">Harding College</a> in <a href="Searcy%2C%20Arkansas">Searcy, Arkansas</a>. After completing a degree, he returned to Texas. He took up farming for a time with his family before eventually deciding to join the military.

Friends and colleagues would later describe Davis as quiet, calm, and reserved as well as a natural leader. When flying, he would become "cool and calculating" in combat. He did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco, unlike many other pilots, and he had a subdued personality in spite of his "daredevil" flying style.

Davis married Doris Lynn Forgason, and was survived by three children, Mary Margaret Davis (born 1944) and George Davis III (born 1952). His wife was six months pregnant with their third child, Charles Lynn Davis, at the time of his death in 1952.

On March 21, 1942, Davis enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in <a href="Lubbock%2C%20Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a>, just after the US entry into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. On June 3, he was appointed an <a href="US%20Army%20Aviation">aviation</a> <a href="cadet">cadet</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a>. He was moved to <a href="Kelly%20Field">Kelly Field</a> in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a> for pre-flight training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to <a href="Jones%20Field">Jones Field</a> in <a href="Bonham%2C%20Texas">Bonham, Texas</a> for primary flight training. During this training, he got his first 60 hours of flight time aboard a <a href="Fairchild%20PT-19">Fairchild PT-19</a> <a href="trainer%20aircraft">trainer aircraft</a>. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco, Texas</a> and a final stint of training aboard the <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">T-6 Texan</a> at <a href="Aloe%20Field">Aloe Field</a> in <a href="Victoria%2C%20Texas">Victoria, Texas</a>. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was <a href="commissioned%20officer">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="US%20Army%20Reserve">US Army Reserve</a>, and immediately ordered to <a href="active%20duty">active duty</a> with the Army Air Forces. By this time he had accrued 314 hours of flight time.

Davis' first assignment was the <a href="312th%20Bombardment%20Group">312th Bombardment Group</a> based at <a href="Bowman%20Field%20%28airport%29">Bowman Field</a> in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>. There, he was qualified to fly the <a href="P-40">P-40 Warhawk fighter plane</a>. He was trained there until August 1943 when the group was ordered to the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater of Operations</a>.

Davis was flown to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> where he was quickly reassigned to the <a href="142d%20Airlift%20Squadron">342nd Fighter Squadron</a>, <a href="348th%20Fighter%20Group">348th Fighter Group</a> of the <a href="Fifth%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Fifth United States Air Force</a>. The group flew the <a href="P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane</a>. By December, his unit moved to <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>, where it could operate over the <a href="Solomon%20Sea">Solomon Sea</a> against air forces of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>, and he quickly earned the nickname "Curly" because of his straight black hair. Davis was also known among the pilots to be very confident of himself. Davis served under the command of <a href="Colonel%20%28US%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Neel%20E.%20Kearby">Neel E. Kearby</a>, who himself would later receive the Medal of Honor. Many of the other pilots in the unit would become aces quickly in the conflict.

In Davis' first combat experience, his unit was sent on a patrol to <a href="Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a> on December 31, 1943, in support of the <a href="New%20Britain%20campaign">New Britain campaign</a> as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Gloucester">Battle of Cape Gloucester</a> began. However, the 15 aircraft were diverted to <a href="Arawe">Arawe</a> to the southwest. There, they were to <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> Japanese aircraft which were targeting Allied convoys during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">Battle of Arawe</a>. En route, they encountered 11 Japanese <a href="Aichi%20D3A">D3A Val</a> and <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a> aircraft attacking an Allied convoy from to . They immediately ambushed the Japanese planes, catching them by surprise. Davis quickly attacked a disorganized formation of the aircraft, downing a D3A Val as it completed a bombing run. By the end of the short battle, eight Japanese aircraft had been shot down and only one American plane had been damaged.

The next combat mission came on February 3, 1944. Sixteen P-47s were on a mission escorting a flight of <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a>s on a bombing mission over <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>. When they were west of the target area, they were ambushed by a flight of <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-43">Nakajima Ki-43 Oscar</a>s and <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-61">Kawasaki Ki-61 Tony</a> aircraft at . As the American aircraft rushed to the defense of the bombers, Davis managed to attack and shoot down a Ki-61 which had been attacking another P-47. In all, seven Japanese aircraft were destroyed in the attack. The next day, Davis was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a>.

For the next several months, Davis' unit undertook patrol and escort missions in the Cape Gloucester area and around the islands of <a href="Landing%20at%20Saidor">Saidor</a>, <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus</a>, and <a href="Momote">Momote</a>. Through May, these actions were relatively uneventful, except for one fighter sweep mission from Wewak. Davis flew 69 missions from May to August, including several dive-bombing attacks on Japanese positions on <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a>. Davis then flew another 40 missions from September to November, including six patrols between <a href="Wakde%20Island">Wakde Island</a> and <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>. On November 14, Davis was promoted to the <a href="temporary%20rank">temporary rank</a> of <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a>.

Around December 1944, the unit began supporting missions in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and was moved to <a href="Tacloban%20Airport">Tacloban Airport</a> on <a href="Leyte%20Island">Leyte Island</a>. On December 10, after five uneventful weather-probing missions, Davis and the unit were assigned an escort mission. The aircraft were to cover a flotilla of <a href="troop%20transports">troop transports</a> moving from <a href="Baybay">Baybay</a> to <a href="Ormoc">Oromoc Bay</a>. En route, they were attacked by four Ki-61 Tony aircraft at . After a quick series of maneuvers, Davis climbed to and used the glare of the sun to ambush two of the aircraft below him. He pursued them as far as <a href="Cebu%20Island">Cebu Island</a>. He closed to within of the pair before destroying the first with his <a href="machine%20guns">machine guns</a>, and then the second near <a href="Negros%20%28island%29">Negros Island</a> as it attempted to dive for cover in a cloud.

The unit undertook eight more patrol missions over <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>, covering Allied convoys.

On December 20, Davis was in one of twelve Thunderbolts patrolling Mindoro when eight A6M Zeroes were spotted attempting to ambush the flight from behind. Davis managed to rake the cockpit of one Zero and kill the pilot, earning him his fifth victory to become a <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>. Immediately after this, however, Davis' P-47 was struck by machine-gun fire from another aircraft, damaging the <a href="propeller">propeller</a> and left wing components. On December 24, on a mission to escort several B-24s on a bombing mission of the Japanese-held <a href="Clark%20Field">Clark Field</a> at <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, Davis shot down two more Zeroes, part of a group of Japanese aircraft attempting to harass the bombers. Davis was awarded a <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for this action.

Between this action and February 19, 1945, Davis flew another 47 missions, most escorting bombers or ships, in addition to a few ground-attack missions, but saw little or no aerial combat in that time. On February 19, he was withdrawn from the front to begin certification on the <a href="P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>, logging 45 hours of training time on the aircraft through the end of March. He returned to combat duty only briefly in April, flying in three combat missions as a <a href="copilot">copilot</a> aboard a <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bomber. On May 3, 1945, he was reassigned to <a href="Goodfellow%20Field">Goodfellow Field</a> at <a href="San%20Angelo%2C%20Texas">San Angelo, Texas</a>, helping to train new pilots and serving as an <a href="operations%20officer">operations officer</a> for the base until the end of the war.

During his World War II service, Davis flew 266 missions, accruing a total of 705 combat hours and destroying seven Japanese aircraft. For these exploits, he was awarded the Silver Star, two <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Crosses</a> and nine <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>s. By the end of this war, Davis had over 2,200 hours of flight time.

After the end of the war, Davis served in a number of administrative positions in the United States. On August 10, 1945, he was assigned to the 556th Air Base Unit at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military in spite of the <a href="demobilization">demobilization</a> and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air Base Unit in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps <a href="aerobatic">aerobatic</a> demonstration teams, the predecessors to the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds">United States Air Force Thunderbirds</a>.

Davis returned to front line units on January 6, 1947, when he was moved to the <a href="71st%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a>, <a href="1st%20Fighter%20Group">1st Fighter Group</a>. He remained with this formation for most of the year. On September 18, 1947, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> was created as a separate branch from the US Army. Davis was commissioned as a captain in the new branch. During his time with the 71st Squadron, Davis attended <a href="Air%20Tactical%20School">Air Tactical School</a> and <a href="Tyndall%20Air%20Force%20Base">Tyndall Air Force Base</a>. He was also a flight commander and air inspector while with the unit.

Upon the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Davis continued to serve in the 71st Squadron and did not see combat in the initial phase of the war. As it progressed, however, Davis began training on the <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a> (Sabrejet), the latest <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>-powered fighter. On February 15, 1951, he was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28US%29">major</a> and in October 1951 he was assigned to the headquarters of the <a href="4th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Wing">4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a>, which was based in Japan and operating aircraft throughout Korea. As such, Davis was sent to the conflict as a fighter pilot.

During a patrol on November 4, 1951, Davis was credited with a "probable" victory over a Russian-made <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a> fighter jet of the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a> or <a href="PLAAF">Chinese Air Force</a>, giving him his first victory of the Korean War. On November 10, Davis was given command of the <a href="334th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a>, a unit of the 4th Wing. Davis and his squadron were relocated to <a href="Kimpo%20Airfield">Kimpo Airfield</a> to allow them the best access to "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>" in North Korea, where much of the air-to-air combat took place. Of his leadership, subordinates often praised the quality of his training; Davis spent a great deal of time training new and younger pilots in tactics during his command. Commanders noted he often led by example, and Davis was known to be greatly respected, even among his rival ace pilots. He gained the nickname "One Burst Davis" for his extremely accurate shooting.

From November 1 to 26, he flew 17 missions in the <a href="Sinanju">Sinanju</a> and <a href="Uiju">Uiju</a> areas, most resulting in no combat. On November 27, Davis was leading a formation of eight F-86s on a patrol near Sinanju, when they spotted and attacked six MiG-15s. He immediately downed one of the MiGs, striking its fuselage and forcing the pilot to bail out. He pursued a second MiG-15 to <a href="Koch%27ong-ni">Koch'ong-ni</a> and damaged it, forcing its pilot to bail out, as well. In all, four of the MiG-15s were destroyed by Davis' patrol.
For several more days, Davis led relatively quiet patrols, until November 30, Davis' 22nd combat mission in Korea. Around 16:00, Davis' flight of eight F-86s spotted a large group of nine <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-2">Tupolev Tu-2</a> bombers from the Chinese <a href="8th%20Bomber%20Division%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">8th Bomber Division</a>, escorted by 16 <a href="Lavochkin%20La-11">Lavochkin La-11</a> fighters from the Chinese <a href="2nd%20Fighter%20Division%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">2nd Fighter Division</a> near <a href="Sahol">Sahol</a> along the <a href="Yalu%20River">Yalu River</a>. The force was en route to a bombing mission on <a href="Taehwado%20Island">Taehwado Island</a> in the <a href="Pansong%20archipelago">Pansong archipelago</a>. Davis maneuvered the patrol into position for a firing pass on the bombers. He completed four attack runs on the formation, being continuously attacked by the La-11 fighters, which were unable to hit his aircraft. In spite of being separated from his wingmen, he managed to destroy two of the bombers and cause the crew of a third to bail out. By this time, another group of F-86s arrived to continue the fight, as Davis' aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. As the flight attempted to withdraw, one of Davis' pilots, Raymond O. Barton, called for help. Davis flew to Barton's aid and found Barton's damaged aircraft under attack from 24 MiG-15s of the Chinese <a href="3rd%20Fighter%20Aviation%20Division%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">3rd Fighter Division</a> arriving as reinforcement. As two MiG-15s prepared a final attack on Barton, Davis swooped through their pass and scored direct hits on one, killing the Chinese flight leader who commanded the MiG pack. The second broke off its attack. Davis then escorted Barton's damaged aircraft back to base, landing with only of fuel left in his tanks. For the day's actions, Davis was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28US%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. The Taehwado bombing mission forced the Chinese Air Force to end all bombing missions for the rest of the war, while the "<a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>" of downing four Chinese aircraft in the fight resulted in raising Davis' confirmed victory count in Korea to six, making him the fifth jet ace of the war and the first ace in the history of the US military to become an ace in two wars. At this point, Davis wrote to his family that he expected to be home by Christmas, but then the Air Force extended his tour of duty.

On December 5, Davis flew his next combat mission, his 23rd of the war. While on a <a href="search-and-destroy">search-and-destroy</a> patrol over <a href="Rinko-do">Rinko-do</a>, Davis spotted two MiG-15s, shooting one down and forcing the other to withdraw. Ten minutes later, he spotted another MiG-15 preparing to attack near <a href="Haech%27ang">Haech'ang</a> and destroyed it as well.

On December 13, another group of MiG-15s attacked Davis during a morning patrol near <a href="Yongwon">Yongwon</a>. Davis destroyed one MiG, and as a second MiG attempted to target his wingman, Davis outmaneuvered it and shot it down. At the end of the patrol, Davis had amassed 10 victories, making him the first double ace of the war. During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the <a href="Sunchun">Sunchun</a>, South Korea area heading further south towards the <a href="Taechon">Taechon</a> area. He surprised and destroyed one MiG, and then turned on another in an aggressive attack which forced the MiG pilot to bail out. After 30 combat missions in Korea, Davis had 12 victories.

After this successful series of patrols, Davis was ordered to conduct only one patrol a day in order to minimize the risk to him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis had apparently ignored it. Both the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.

In January, Davis wrote home, expressing frustration at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions. He also began to express contempt for the F-86, feeling at times it was being outperformed by the MiG and that "something will have to be done" to give the UN pilots more of an advantage in combat. He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. "They're trying to make a hero of me and I find it rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.

In late January 1951, the Air Force told Davis it wanted to rotate him back to the United States. By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, including most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft. Other pilots indicated they wanted him to stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.

On February 10, 1952, Davis flew his 59th and last combat mission of the war in an F-86E Sabre (<a href="United%20States%20military%20aircraft%20serials">tail number</a> 51-2752). That day, he led a flight of four F-86s on a patrol near the Yalu River, near the <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>n border. Davis' group was part of a larger UN force of 18 F-86s operating in the area. As Davis' patrol reached the border, one of his F-86 pilots reported he was out of oxygen causing Davis to order him to return to base with his wingman. As Davis continued patrolling with one wingman, Second Lieutenant William W. Littlefield, and cruising at an altitude of , they spotted a flight of 12 MiG-15s of the Chinese <a href="4th%20Fighter%20Division%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">4th Fighter Division</a> heading in the direction of a group of US <a href="F-84%20Thunderjet">F-84 Thunderjet</a>s conducting a low-level bombing mission on North Korean communication lines.

The MiGs were below Davis and Littlefield and had not noticed them. Without hesitating, Davis immediately flew behind the MiG-15 formation and attacked them from the rear. His surprise attack destroyed one of the MiG-15s, and he quickly turned to the next closest MiG and destroyed it before it could outmaneuver him. By this time, Davis and Littlefield passed many of the MiGs and some that were behind them began firing. Davis then moved to target a third MiG at the front of the formation, but as he was lining up his shot a MiG scored a direct hit on Davis' fuselage, causing his aircraft to spin out of control. Littlefield said later, that he spotted Davis' landing gear open, indicating hydraulic failure, and that he attempted to defend Davis' aircraft as it lost altitude until Davis crashed and died. Littlefield reported he did not see Davis bail out of his aircraft. Davis was declared <a href="missing%20in%20action">missing in action</a> and presumed killed. Intense aerial searches of the area later revealed no evidence that Davis had survived the crash. In fact, a week after the incident, the Chinese military searched the region and recovered Davis' body, still in the crashed aircraft. Despite the Chinese discovery of Davis' remains, his body was never returned to the United States.

In four months in Korea, Davis had scored 14 confirmed victories, 1 probable victory and 2 aircraft damaged, bringing his career total victory count to 21. By the end of the war, he was ranked fourth among pilots, surpassed by <a href="Joseph%20C.%20McConnell">Joseph C. McConnell</a>, <a href="James%20Jabara">James Jabara</a>, and <a href="Manuel%20J.%20Fernandez">Manuel J. Fernandez</a>, after his death. Immediately following word of the mission, fellow ace <a href="Colonel%20%28US%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Harrison%20Thyng">Harrison Thyng</a>, commander of the 4th Wing, recommended Davis for the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. On April 15, 1953, Davis was posthumously promoted to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28US%29">lieutenant colonel</a>. Davis' <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> is located in the <a href="City%20of%20Lubbock%20Cemetery">City of Lubbock Cemetery</a> in <a href="Lubbock%2C%20Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a>. Also buried at this cemetery is musician <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a> and Medal of Honor recipient <a href="Herman%20C.%20Wallace">Herman C. Wallace</a>. In April 1953, Davis' wife and family received his Medal of Honor from <a href="Air%20Force%20Chief%20of%20Staff">Air Force Chief of Staff</a>, <a href="General%20%28US%29">General</a> <a href="Nathan%20F.%20Twining">Nathan F. Twining</a>, at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock.

A number of controversies have since emerged surrounding the circumstances leading to Davis' death in North Korea. His presence in Korea at the time, the necessity of his actions, and the identity of his assailant have all been in dispute.

After Davis' death, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">US Representative</a> <a href="George%20H.%20Mahon">George H. Mahon</a> (<a href="Texas%27s%2019th%20congressional%20district">D-19</a>) ordered an investigation into why Davis had remained in Korea after he became a fighter ace. US military policy was to rotate pilots to stateside duty once they became aces, both so that they could train other pilots and so that they would not be killed in action. Mahon had been requesting Davis be rotated back to the US up to a month before his death.

Davis' wife, Doris Davis, expressed anger toward the Air Force after his death, claiming that he had wanted to return to the United States after he became an ace but was not allowed to. She also claimed, he was forced against his will into combat duty in Korea. Her complaints prompted media attention of the <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28United%20States%29">Far East Air Force</a> and its policies regarding the rotation of troops and pilots into and out of duty in Korea. She became an outspoken critic of the entire war and publicly denounced it, something rarely done by widows of American soldiers during the war. She had been a vocal opponent of the war since its beginning, however.

Subsequent to Davis' death, some historians have questioned if his actions were necessary given the situation. <a href="Barrett%20Tillman">Barrett Tillman</a> (author, military aviation) contended Davis' Medal of Honor was merely a public relations move brought on by the US military to quell questions surrounding his death and draw attention away from his wife's vocal opposition to the war. The Medal of Honor citation credited Davis with saving the F-84 formation, but the formation of F-86s that Davis was leading actually outnumbered the MiG-15s and Davis could easily have drawn them into the battle. Still, fellow pilots attested to Davis' bravery. Fellow ace <a href="William%20T.%20Whisner">William T. Whisner</a> said, "George Davis was the best fighter pilot I ever knew. The only thing he didn't have was concern of his own life."

As the Korean War progressed, other pilots began to describe Davis as "more brazen, more aggressive, and more willing to take risks in Korea than he was during World War II." He became increasingly contemptuous of the Soviet and Chinese MiG pilots he faced as time went on, leading to other pilots thinking he may have underestimated the skills of his opponents, contributing to his death.

Davis' death generated controversy between China and Russia, in which both Chinese MiG pilot <a href="Zhang%20Jihui">Zhang Jihui</a> and Soviet pilot Mikhail A. Averin () claimed credit for his downing. Although Zhang was credited by the Chinese for shooting down Davis' F-86, Russian sources disputed his claim 40 years later by raising the possibility that Averin was the MiG pilot responsible. Davis was the highest ranking American Korean War ace at the time and the only American ace killed in action during the war. His death would have been a huge propaganda victory for the nation whose pilot was responsible for shooting him down. Davis' death at the hands of a Chinese pilot would also avenge the losses inflicted by him over Taehwado Island on November 30, 1951. About 36 MiG-15s from the Chinese 4th Fighter Division were involved in the February 10 engagement in which Davis was killed, and Zhang was among the group. According to Zhang's own report after the battle, while the MiGs were en route to intercept Davis' group, he and his wingman became separated from the main element. As Zhang was trying to rejoin his formation, he spotted a group of eight F-86s in the area between <a href="Taechon">Taechon</a> and <a href="Chongye">Chongye</a> at 07:40. Zhang and his wingman then swung down onto the tails of two Sabres and opened fire. Zhang claimed that he shot down both Sabres, but reinforcements soon destroyed his MiG while killing his wingman.

The publicity of Davis' death soon caught Chinese attention. To determine whether Davis was killed by Zhang in the absence of <a href="gun%20camera">gun camera</a> footage, the 4th Fighter Division sent two search teams on February 16 and 18. They recovered the wreckage of an F-86E, along with Davis' body and his belongings. His <a href="Dog%20tag%20%28military%29">dog tag</a> is currently on display at the <a href="Dandong">Dandong</a> Korean War Museum. The search team also discovered that the crash site was within of where Zhang had ejected from his own aircraft, and Zhang's 12th Regiment was the only unit that operated near the area. In light of these findings and the testimonies from ground troops that had witnessed the battle, Zhang was credited by the Chinese military for shooting down Davis' F-86.

However, according to the recollections of the pilots of the <a href="64th%20Fighter%20Aviation%20Corps">Soviet 64th Aviation Corps</a>, both Zhang and his wingman were probably shot down by Davis, who was in turn surprised and shot down by Averin, who had been scrambling to save the Chinese MiGs. <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> Georgeii Lobov (), commander of the 64th Aviation Corps, also noted in his memoir that Davis was killed by a Soviet pilot.

Both China and Russia have taken credit over Davis' death, with no conclusive evidence for either side. Regardless of the controversy surrounding Davis' death, Zhang became a household name in China, and the victory was one of the few proud moments in the Chinese Air Force's poor performance in Korea. The Chinese military later awarded Zhang the title <a href="Hero%27s%20Medal">Combat Hero, 1st Class</a> for this action.

Throughout his career, Davis was credited with 21 confirmed victories, 1 probable victory and 2 aircraft damaged. This made him one of only 30 US pilots to gain more than 20 confirmed victories over their careers. He had been known to be an extremely talented pilot and was especially accurate at <a href="deflection%20shooting">deflection shooting</a>, even from long distances against moving targets. Davis was one of 1,297 <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20aces%20from%20the%20United%20States">World War II aces from the United States</a>, with seven confirmed kills during that war. He later became one of 41 <a href="List%20of%20Korean%20War%20flying%20aces">Korean War aces from the United States</a>, with 14 confirmed victories during that war. At the time of his death, he was the top-scoring ace from the US, making him the <a href="List%20of%20aces%20of%20aces">ace of aces</a>. By the end of the war, he was the fourth-highest scoring ace.

During the Korean War, Davis' accomplishments were particularly noteworthy. He was the only F-86 pilot to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and he was one of very few pilots who were able to score multiple kills on a single patrol. This was an extremely rare feat, which Davis accomplished on four occasions and which was rivaled only by fellow ace <a href="James%20Jabara">James Jabara</a> who also scored a notable number of double victories. In shooting down four Chinese aircraft on November 30, 1951, Davis scored the most kills in a single day of any pilot in the war. Davis also took the shortest time to become a double ace; just 17 days in Korea. The next best pilot achieved the feat in 51 days.

Davis is one of six US Air Force pilots and seven US pilots overall who achieved ace status as both a piston-engined pilot in World War II and as a jet pilot in a later conflict. The others are <a href="Francis%20S.%20Gabreski">Francis S. Gabreski</a>, <a href="James%20P.%20Hagerstrom">James P. Hagerstrom</a>, <a href="William%20T.%20Whisner">William T.

Bolt</a> of the <a href="US%20Marine%20Corps">US Marine Corps</a>.

Davis' military decorations and awards include:

Davis was the third of four members of the US Air Force to be awarded the Medal of Honor in the Korean War, after <a href="Louis%20J.%20Sebille">Louis J. Sebille</a>, <a href="John%20S.%20Walmsley%20Jr.">John S. Walmsley Jr.</a> and before <a href="Charles%20J.%20Loring%20Jr.">Charles J. Loring Jr.</a> All four Air Force recipients of the MOH were pilots who were killed in action and the only USAF members to be awarded the Army version of the medal.

Hydnum repandum

Hydnum repandum, commonly known as the sweet tooth, wood hedgehog or hedgehog mushroom, is a <a href="Basidiomycota">basidiomycete</a> fungus of the family <a href="Hydnaceae">Hydnaceae</a>. First <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1753, it is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Hydnum">Hydnum</a>". The fungus produces <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (mushrooms) that are characterized by their <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing structures—in the form of spines rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>—which hang down from the underside of the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>. The cap is dry, colored yellow to light orange to brown, and often develops an irregular shape, especially when it has grown closely crowded with adjacent fruit bodies. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">mushroom tissue</a> is white with a pleasant odor and a spicy or bitter taste. All parts of the mushroom stain orange with age or when bruised.

A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus, "Hydnum repandum" is broadly distributed in Europe, Asia and western North America, where it fruits singly or in close groups in <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> or <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland. This is a choice <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species, although mature specimens can develop a bitter taste. It has no poisonous lookalikes. Mushrooms are collected and sold in local markets of Europe and Canada.

First officially <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1753 "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", "Hydnum repandum" was <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> by Swedish mycologist <a href="Elias%20Fries">Elias Fries</a> in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: "Hypothele" by French naturalist <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Paulet">Jean-Jacques Paulet</a> in 1812; "Dentinum" by British botanist <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> in 1821; "Tyrodon" by Finnish mycologist <a href="Petter%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> in 1881; "<a href="Sarcodon">Sarcodon</a>" by French naturalist <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1886. After a 1977 <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> proposal by American mycologist <a href="Ron%20Petersen">Ronald H. Petersen</a> was accepted, "Hydnum repandum" became the official <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Hydnum". Previously, supporting arguments for making "H. repandum" the type were made by Dutch taxonomist <a href="Marinus%20Anton%20Donk">Marinus Anton Donk</a> (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Czech mycologist <a href="Zden%C4%9Bk%20Pouzar">Zdeněk Pouzar</a> (1958) and Canadian mycologist <a href="Kenneth%20A.%20Harrison">Kenneth Harrison</a> (1971) thought that "<a href="Sarcodon%20imbricatus">H. imbricatum</a>" should be the type.

Several <a href="form%20%28botany%29">forms</a> and <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> of "H. repandum" have been described. Forms "albidum" and "rufescens", found in Russia, were published by T.L. Nikolajeva in 1961; the latter <a href="taxon">taxon</a> is <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonymous</a> with "<a href="Hydnum%20rufescens">H. rufescens</a>". Form "amarum", published from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988, is illegitimate as per article 36.1 of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</a>, as it was not given a sufficiently comprehensive description. French botanist <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Barla">Jean-Baptiste Barla</a> described "H. repandum" var. "rufescens" in 1859. English naturalist <a href="Carleton%20Rea">Carleton Rea</a> described the white-fruit bodied version as a variety—"H. repandum" var. "album"—in 1922.

<a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> studies have shown that the current <a href="species%20concept">species concept</a> for "H. repandum" needed revision as there was a poor overlap between <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and molecular species concepts. A 2009 <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of European specimens, based on <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicated that "H. repandum" specimens form two distinct <a href="clade">clade</a>s, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences foreshadowed the presence of undescribed <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a>, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive <a href="speciation">speciation</a>. A comprehensive genetic study published in 2016 of members of the genus worldwide found that there are at least four species in the broad concept of "H. repandum": two species from southern China, one from Europe and eastern North America, and "H. repandum" itself from Europe, western North America, and northern (and alpine southwestern) China and Japan. Although it is missing from Central America, genetic material has been recovered from Venezuela from the tree "<a href="Pakaraimaea">Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea</a>", suggesting it somehow migrated there and had changed hosts.

The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> "repandum" means "bent back", referring to the wavy cap margin. The varietal epithet "album" means "white as an egg". "Hydnum repandum" has been given several <a href="common%20name">vernacular names</a>: "sweet tooth", "yellow tooth fungus", "wood urchin", "spreading hedgehog", "hedgehog mushroom", or "pig's trotter". The variety "album" is known as "white wood".

The orange-, yellow- or tan-colored <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">pileus</a> (cap) is up to wide, although specimens measuring have been documented. It is generally somewhat irregular in shape (it may be convex or concave at maturity), with a wavy margin that is rolled inward when young. Caps grow in a distorted shape when fruit bodies are closely clustered. The cap surface is generally dry and smooth, although mature specimens may show cracking. Viewed from above, the caps of mature specimens resemble somewhat those of chanterelles. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thick, white, firm, brittle, and bruises yellow to orange-brown. The underside is densely covered with small, slender whitish spines measuring long. These spines sometimes run down at least one side of the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. The stipe, typically long and thick, is either white or the same color as the cap, and is sometimes off-center. It is easy to overlook the mushrooms when they are situated amongst <a href="agaric">gilled mushrooms</a> and <a href="bolete">bolete</a>s, because the cap and stipe are fairly nondescript and the mushrooms must be turned over to reveal their spines. The pure white variety of this species, "H. repandum" var. "album", is smaller than the main variety, with a cap measuring wide and a stipe that is long.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is pale <a href="cream%20%28colour%29">cream</a>. <a href="Basidiospore">Spores</a> are smooth, thin-walled and <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), roughly spherical to broadly egg-shaped, and measure 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5 <a href="micrometer">µm</a>. They usually contain a single, large <a href="refraction">refractive</a> oil droplet. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 6–10 µm. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is a trichodermium (where the outermost <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface) of narrow, club-shaped cells that are 2.5–4 µm wide. Underneath this tissue is the subhymenial layer of interwoven hyphae measuring 10–20 µm in diameter. The spine tissue is made of narrow (2–5 µm diameter), thin-walled hyphae with <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s.

North American lookalikes include the white hedgehog ("<a href="Hydnum%20albidum">Hydnum albidum</a>") and the giant hedgehog ("<a href="Hydnum%20albomagnum">Hydnum albomagnum</a>"). "H. albidum" has a white to pale yellowish grey fruit body that bruises yellow to orange. "H. albomagnum" is large and paler than "H. repandum". "<a href="Hydnum%20umbilicatum">Hydnum umbilicatum</a>" is smaller, with caps measuring in diameter, and thinner stipes that are wide. Its caps are umbilicate (with a navel-like cavity), sometimes with a hole in the center of the cap, unlike the flattened or slightly depressed caps of "H. repandum". Microscopically, "H. umbilicatum" has spores that are larger and more elliptical than those of "H. repandum", measuring 7.5–9 by 6–7.5 µm. A European lookalike, "<a href="Hydnum%20rufescens">Hydnum rufescens</a>", is also smaller than "H. repandum", and has a deeper <a href="apricot%20%28color%29">apricot</a> to orange color. "<a href="Hydnum%20ellipsosporum">Hydnum ellipsosporum</a>", described as a new species from Germany in 2004, differs from "H. repandum" by the shape and length of its spores, which are <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> and measure 9–11 by 6–7.5 µm. Compared to "H. repandum", it has smaller fruit bodies, with cap diameters ranging from wide.

"H. repandum" is a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus. The fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground or in <a href="leaf%20litter">leaf litter</a> in both <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s. They can also grow in <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. Fruiting occurs from summer to autumn. The species is widely distributed in the northern <a href="temperate">temperate</a> zone, and is one of the most common of the tooth fungi. It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America. In Europe, it has been listed as a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> in the <a href="Red%20Data%20List">Red Data List</a>s of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden lists it as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

"H. repandum" is considered to be a good <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it the culinary equivalent of the <a href="chanterelle">chanterelle</a>. Author Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of "great" and notes that there are no <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> lookalikes, and that "H. repandum" mushrooms are unlikely to be infested with maggots. Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. "H. repandum" mushrooms can be cooked by <a href="pickling">pickling</a>, <a href="simmering">simmering</a> in milk or <a href="stock%20%28food%29">stock</a>, and <a href="saut%C3%A9eing">sautéeing</a>, which creates a "tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor." The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes the flavors of added ingredients. The firm texture of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural flavor is reportedly similar to the peppery taste of <a href="watercress">watercress</a>, or <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s. Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness. Specimens found under conifers can taste "unpleasantly strong". The form "amarum", locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages.

"Hydnum repandum" is frequently sold with chanterelles in Italy, and in France, it is one of the officially recognized edible species sold in markets. In Europe, it is usually sold under its French name "Pied-de-Mouton" (Sheep's Foot). It is also collected and sold in local markets of Mexico, Spain and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada. "H. repandum" mushrooms are also used as a food source by the <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> ("Sciurus vulgaris").

As a widespread edible species, "H. repandum" has been the subject of several scientific studies determining its nutritional and chemical composition. "H. repandum" fruit bodies contain 10.7% <a href="water%20content">moisture</a> and 9.2% <a href="Ash%20%28analytical%20chemistry%29">ash</a>. The <a href="organic%20acid">organic acid</a> composition includes <a href="malic%20acid">malic acid</a> (0.31 grams per 100 g of mushroom, dry weight) and <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a> (0.65%). One study assessed the proportion of <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s (value expressed as a percentage of the total amino acids): <a href="valine">valine</a>, 3.9%; <a href="leucine">leucine</a>, 14.5%; <a href="isoleucine">isoleucine</a>, 3.2%; <a href="threonine">threonine</a>, 4.4%; <a href="methionine">methionine</a>, 1%; <a href="lysine">lysine</a>, 4.2%; <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, 3.4%; <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, 1.4%. Lipid content is 4.7% (expressed as a percent of <a href="dry%20matter">dry matter</a>). Major <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s include <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitate</a> (15.7%), <a href="stearic%20acid">stearate</a> (0.9%), <a href="oleic%20acid">oleate</a> (26.4%), <a href="linoleic%20acid">lineoleate</a> (47.5%), and <a href="linolenic%20acid">linolenate</a> (20.3%). The <a href="plant%20sterol">mycosterol</a> content has been recorded as 628 milligrams of <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> and 85 mg of <a href="fungisterol">fungisterol</a> (both values per 100 grams of dry matter).

Both "H. repandum" and the variety "album" contain the <a href="epoxide">diepoxide</a> compound <a href="repandiol">repandiol</a> (2"R",3"R",8"R",9"R")-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which was shown to have potent <a href="cytoxicity">cytotoxic</a> activity against various tumor <a href="cell%20line">cells</a> in laboratory culture. At the molecular level, repandiol is an <a href="alkylating%20agent">alkylating agent</a>. It inserts <a href="crosslinking%20of%20DNA">crosslinks</a> between strands of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, making it difficult for the genetic material to be <a href="gene%20expression">expressed</a> or <a href="DNA%20replication">replicated</a>. The <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> chemicals responsible for the fruity aroma of the mushroom are known. The 12 compounds include eight-<a href="carbon">carbon</a> derivatives such as <a href="1-octen-3-ol">1-octen-3-ol</a>, ("E")-2-<a href="octenol">octenol</a>, and ("E")-1,3-<a href="octadiene">octadiene</a>. European studies conducted after the 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> have shown that the fruit bodies have a high rate of <a href="bioaccumulation">accumulation</a> of the radioactive isotope <a href="cesium">cesium</a>.
