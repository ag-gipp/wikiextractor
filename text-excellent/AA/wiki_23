Jerome, Arizona

Jerome is a town in the <a href="Black%20Hills%20%28Yavapai%20County%29">Black Hills</a> of <a href="Yavapai%20County%2C%20Arizona">Yavapai County</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the <a href="Verde%20Valley">Verde Valley</a>, it is more than above sea level. It is about north of <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> along <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%2089A">State Route 89A</a> between <a href="Sedona%2C%20Arizona">Sedona</a> and <a href="Prescott%2C%20Arizona">Prescott</a>. Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines, it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s. As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a>, its population was 444.

The town owes its existence mainly to two <a href="ore">ore</a> bodies that formed about 1.75 billion years ago along a <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Ring%20fault">ring fault</a> in the <a href="caldera">caldera</a> of an undersea volcano. <a href="Tectonic%20plate">Tectonic plate</a> movements, plate collisions, <a href="Tectonic%20uplift">uplift</a>, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface, both near Jerome. In the late 19th century, the United Verde Mine, developed by <a href="William%20A.%20Clark">William A. Clark</a>, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension <a href="UVX%20Mining%20Co.">UVX</a> Mine, owned by <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%20Jr.">James Douglas, Jr.</a>, depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found.

Jerome made news in 1917, when strikes involving the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again during and after the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1967. By the early 21st century, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.

Jerome is about north of <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and southwest of <a href="Flagstaff%2C%20Arizona">Flagstaff</a> along <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%2089A">Arizona State Route 89A</a> between <a href="Sedona%2C%20Arizona">Sedona</a> to the east and <a href="Prescott%2C%20Arizona">Prescott</a> to the west. The town is in Arizona's <a href="Black%20Hills%20%28Yavapai%20County%29">Black Hills</a>, which trend north–south. The town lies within the <a href="Prescott%20National%20Forest">Prescott National Forest</a> at an elevation of more than . <a href="Woodchute%20Wilderness">Woodchute Wilderness</a> is about west of Jerome, and <a href="Mingus%20Mountain">Mingus Mountain</a>, at above sea level, is about south of town. <a href="Jerome%20State%20Historic%20Park">Jerome State Historic Park</a> is in the town itself. Bitter Creek, a tributary of the <a href="Verde%20River">Verde River</a>, flows intermittently through Jerome. East of Jerome at the base of the hills are the <a href="Verde%20Valley">Verde Valley</a> and the communities of <a href="Clarkdale%2C%20Arizona">Clarkdale</a> and <a href="Cottonwood%2C%20Arizona">Cottonwood</a>, site of the nearest airport.

 Most of Cleopatra Hill, the rock formation upon which Jerome was built, is 1.75 billion (1,750 million) years old. Created by a massive <a href="caldera">caldera</a> eruption in <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a>—elsewhere more narrowly identified as <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a>—seas south of what later became northern Arizona, the Cleopatra <a href="tuff">tuff</a> was then part of a small <a href="tectonic">tectonic</a> plate that was moving toward the proto-North American continent. After the eruption, cold sea water entered Earth's crust through cracks caused by the eruption. Heated by rising <a href="magma">magma</a> to or more, the water was forced upward again, chemically altering the rocks it encountered and becoming rich in dissolved minerals. When the hot solution emerged from a <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a> at the bottom of the ocean, its dissolved minerals solidified and fell to the sea floor. The accumulating <a href="Volcanogenic%20massive%20sulfide%20ore%20deposit">sulfide deposits</a> from two such vents formed the <a href="ore">ore</a> bodies, the United Verde and the UVX, most important to Jerome 1.75 billion years later.

These ore bodies formed in different places along a <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Ring%20fault">ring fault</a> in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate and then with the proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff in such a way that the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome <a href="anticline">anticline</a>.

No record exists for the next 1.2 billion years of Jerome's geologic history. Evidence from the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>, further north in Arizona, suggests that thick layers of sediment may have been laid down atop the ore bodies and later eroded away. The gap in the rock record has been called the <a href="Great%20Unconformity">Great Unconformity</a>.

About 525 million years ago, when northern Arizona was at the bottom of a shallow sea, a thin layer of sediment called the <a href="Tapeats%20Sandstone">Tapeats Sandstone</a> was deposited over the Cleopatra tuff. Limestones and other sediments accumulated above the sandstone until about 70 million years ago when the <a href="Laramide%20Orogeny">Laramide Orogeny</a> created new mountains and new faults in the region. One of these faults, the Verde Fault, runs directly under Jerome along the Jerome anticline. Crustal stretching beginning about 15 million years ago created <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a> topography in central and southern Arizona, caused volcanic activity near Jerome, and induced movement along the Verde Fault. This movement exposed the tip of the United Verde ore body at one place on Cleopatra Hill and moved the UVX ore body to below the surface. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>, laid down between 15 and 10 million years ago, covers the surface beneath the UVX <a href="headframe">headframe</a>s and Jerome State Historic Park. The basalt, the top layer of the <a href="Hickey%20Formation">Hickey Formation</a>, caps layers of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>.

The natural rock features in and around Jerome were greatly altered by mining. The town is underlain by of mine shafts. These may have contributed to the <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> that destroyed some of Jerome's buildings, which slid slowly downhill during the first half of the 20th century. The United Verde open pit, about deep, is on the edge of town next to Cleopatra Hill. The side of the pit consists of Precambrian <a href="gabbro">gabbro</a>. Mine shafts beneath the pit extend to below the surface.

The <a href="Hohokam">Hohokam</a> were the first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>. Later, long before the arrival of Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the colorful copper-bearing minerals <a href="malachite">malachite</a> and <a href="azurite">azurite</a>. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface.

The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spanish <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a>s. At the time the area was part of "New Mexico", and the Spaniards often organized silver and gold prospecting expeditions in the area. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold and silver, not copper.

The area became part of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> when Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, and part of the United States by terms of the <a href="1848%20Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>, which concluded the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. The war's major consequence was the <a href="Mexican%20Cession">Mexican Cession</a> of the northern territories of <a href="Alta%20California">Alta California</a> and <a href="Santa%20Fe%20de%20Nuevo%20M%C3%A9xico">Santa Fe de Nuevo México</a> to the United States.
Angus McKinnon and Morris A. Ruffner filed the first copper mining claims at this location in 1876. In 1880, <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20Tritle">Frederick A. Tritle</a>, the governor of the <a href="Arizona%20Territory">Arizona Territory</a>, and Frederick F. Thomas, a mining engineer from San Francisco, bought these claims from the original owners. In 1883, with the aid of eastern financiers including James A. MacDonald and Eugene Jerome of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, they created the United Verde Copper Company. The small adjacent mining camp on Cleopatra Hill was named "Jerome" in honor of Eugene Jerome, who became the company secretary. United Verde built a small <a href="smelter">smelter</a> at Jerome and constructed wagon roads from it to Prescott, the Verde Valley, and the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad">Atlantic and Pacific Railroad</a> depot at <a href="Ash%20Fork%2C%20Arizona">Ash Fork</a>. However, transport by wagon was expensive, and in late 1884 after the price of copper had fallen by 50 percent, the company ceased all operations at the site.

Four years later, <a href="William%20A.%20Clark">William A. Clark</a>, who had made a fortune in mining and commercial ventures in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, bought the United Verde properties and, among other improvements, enlarged the smelter. He ordered construction of a <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge railway</a>, the <a href="United%20Verde%20%26amp%3B%20Pacific%20Railway">United Verde & Pacific</a>, to <a href="Jerome%20Junction%2C%20Arizona">Jerome Junction</a>, a railway transfer point to the west. As mining of the ore expanded, Jerome's population grew from 250 in 1890 to more than 2,500 by 1900. By then the United Verde Mine had become the leading copper producer in the Arizona Territory, employing about 800 men, and was one of the largest mines in the world. Over its 77-year life (1876 to 1953), this mine produced nearly 33 million tons of copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc ore. The metals produced by United Verde and UVX, the other big mine in Jerome, were said to be worth more than $1 billion. According to geologists Lon Abbott and Terri Cook, the combined copper deposits of Jerome were among the richest ever found.

Jerome had a post office by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 destroyed much of the business district and half of the community's homes, Jerome was <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> as a town in 1899. Incorporation made it possible to collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting system and to establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.

By 1900, Jerome had churches, fraternal organizations, and a downtown with brick buildings, telephone service, and electric lights. Among the thriving businesses were those associated with alcohol, gambling, and <a href="prostitution">prostitution</a> serving a population that was 78 percent male. In 1903, the "<a href="New%20York%20Sun%20%28historical%29">New York Sun</a>" proclaimed Jerome to be "the wickedest town in the West".

Jerome, which was legally separate from United Verde and supported many independent businesses, did not meet the definition of a <a href="company%20town">company town</a> even though it depended for decades largely on a single company. In 1914, a separate company, the United Verde Extension Mining Company (UVX), led by <a href="James%20S.%20Douglas%2C%20Jr.">James S. Douglas, Jr.</a> (nicknamed Rawhide Jimmy), discovered a second ore body near Jerome that produced a <a href="%3Awikt%3Abonanza">bonanza</a>. The UVX Mine, also known as the "Little Daisy Mine", became spectacularly profitable: during 1916 alone, it produced $10 million worth of copper, silver and gold, of which $7.4 million was profit. This mine eventually produced more than $125 million worth of ore and paid more than $50 million in dividends. Total production amounted to four million tons, much less than the United Verde total but from uncommonly rich ore averaging more than 10 percent copper and in places rising to 45 percent.
Starting in 1914, <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> greatly increased the demand for copper, and by 1916 the number of companies involved in mining near Jerome reached 22. These companies employed about 3,000 miners in the district. Meanwhile, United Verde was building a large smelter complex and company town, Clarkdale, and a <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> railway, the Verde Tunnel and Smelter Railroad, to haul ore from its mine to the new smelter. After the new railway opened in 1915, the company dismantled the Jerome smelter and converted the mine to an open-pit operation by 1919. The switch from underground to open-pit mining stemmed from a series of fires, some burning for decades, in the mine's high-<a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> ores. Removing the <a href="overburden">overburden</a> and pouring a mixture of water, waste ore, and sand into rock fissures helped control the fires. By 1918, UVX also had its own smelter in its own company town near Cottonwood; the company town was named Clemenceau in 1920. In 1929, a company named Verde Central opened what at first appeared to be another "great mine" about a mile southwest of Jerome.

The labor situation in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions—the <a href="Western%20Federation%20of%20Miners">International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers</a> (MMSW), the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners—had members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners' <a href="strike%20action">strikes</a> involving the IWW, which had been organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests as well as other labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not recognize it as legitimate. In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for less than they wanted.

In July, the IWW called for a strike against all the mines in the district. In this case, the MMSW voted 470 to 194 "against" striking. Three days later, about 250 armed <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a>s rounded up at least 60 suspected IWW members, loaded them onto a railroad <a href="Stock%20car%20%28rail%29">cattle car</a>, and shipped them out of town in what has been called the Jerome Deportation. Nine IWW members, thought by the Prescott sheriff's department to be leaders, were arrested and jailed temporarily in Prescott though never charged with a crime; others were taken to <a href="Needles%2C%20California">Needles, California</a>, then to <a href="Kingman%2C%20Arizona">Kingman, Arizona</a>, where they were released after promising to desist from "further agitation".

Following a brief post-war downturn, boom times returned to Jerome in the 1920s. Copper prices rose to 24 cents a pound in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at near capacity. Wages rose, consumers spent, and the town's businesses—including five automobile dealerships—prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town's schools, churches, and hospitals.

In 1930, after the start of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the price of copper fell to 14 cents a pound. In response, United Verde began reducing its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to <a href="Phelps%20Dodge">Phelps Dodge</a>, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.

Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a> in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke. 

Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.

To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21st century include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.

July is typically the warmest month in Jerome, when highs average and lows average . January is coldest, when the high temperatures average and the lows average . The highest recorded temperature through 2005 was in 2003, and the lowest was in 1963. August, averaging about of rain, is the wettest month, while the spring months of April to June generally do not have significant rainfall.

Although most precipitation arrives in the town as rain, snow and fog sometimes occur. On average, about of snow falls in January and lesser amounts in February, March, April, November, and December. Even so, the "average" depth of snow on the ground between 1897 and 2005 was so close to zero that it is reported as zero. Jerome is often windy, especially in spring and fall. Summer thunderstorms can be violent.

The makeup of early Jerome differed greatly from the 21st-century version of the town. The original mining claims were filed by North American ranchers and prospectors, but as the mines were developed, workers of varied ethnic groups and nationalities arrived. Among these were people of Irish, Chinese, Italian, and Slavic origin who came to Jerome in the late 19th century. By the time of World War I, Mexican nationals were arriving in large numbers, and census figures suggest that in 1930 about 60 percent of the town's residents were <a href="Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29">Latino</a>. This statistic is supported by mining company records showing that about 57 percent of the UVX workers were Mexican nationals in 1931 and that foreign-born and Spanish-surnamed workers accounted for about 77 percent of the UVX work force.

The ratio of females to males also varied greatly over time in Jerome. Census data from 1900 through 1950 show a gradual rise in the percentage of female residents, who accounted for only 22 percent of the population at the turn of the century but about 50 percent by mid-century.

As of the <a href="census">census</a> of 2010, Jerome was home to 444 people comprising 253 households, 93 of which were families made up of a householder and one or more people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The other 160 were non-family. The residents had a racial makeup that was nearly 94 percent white, and the remainder was listed in the census as black or African American, Native American, Asian, other, or combinations thereof. About 6 percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population, nearly evenly split along gender lines, consisted of 226 women with a median age of 54 and 218 men with a median age of 55. The estimated population in 2015 was 456.

As of 2014, the median income for a household in the town was about $32,000. About 10 percent of families in Jerome had incomes below the <a href="poverty%20line">poverty line</a> in 2014.

Jerome has a <a href="mayor%E2%80%93council">mayor–council</a> government. The five seats on the council are filled by public election once every two years, and the council member receiving the most votes in that election becomes the mayor. Frank Vander Horst, elected in 2016, is the mayor through 2018.

Yavapai County typically elects <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> to state and federal offices. About 64 percent of its participating voters chose Republican <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> for president in 2012, and about 63 percent chose Republican <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> in 2016. At the state level, <a href="Walter%20Blackman">Walter Blackman</a> and <a href="Bob%20Thorpe%20%28politician%29">Bob Thorpe</a>, both Republicans, represent Jerome as part of the Sixth Legislative District of the <a href="Arizona%20Legislature">Arizona Legislature</a>. Republican <a href="Sylvia%20Allen">Sylvia Allen</a> represents the Sixth District in the <a href="Arizona%20Senate">Arizona Senate</a>. At the federal level, Republican <a href="Paul%20Gosar">Paul Gosar</a> represents Jerome and the rest of Arizona's Fourth Congressional District in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. Republican <a href="Martha%20McSally">Martha McSally</a> and <a href="Kyrsten%20Sinema">Kyrsten Sinema</a>, a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>, represent Arizona in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>.

The town is patrolled by its own police department and is also served by the Eastern Area Command of the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. About two dozen men and women comprise Jerome's volunteer fire department, which serves an area of more than including nearby rural and mountainous terrain as well as the town itself. Firefighting, emergency medical service, and wilderness rescues are its specialties. Jerome is in the Verde Valley Precinct of the Yavapai County Justice Court system.

In 2013, Jerome was the third municipality in Arizona to recognize <a href="civil%20union">civil union</a>s between same-sex partners, after <a href="Bisbee%2C%20Arizona">Bisbee</a> and <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a>.

Jerome's economy is centered mainly on recreation and tourism. Figures published in 2015 showed that more than 50 percent of the labor force worked in arts, entertainment, retail, food and recreation services, while manufacturing and construction employed just over 10 percent. Between 1990 and 2006 the value of taxable sales increased from $4.8 million to $15.5 million, and between 1990 and 2014 the <a href="Unemployment%20in%20the%20United%20States">unemployment rate</a> fell from 4.2 percent to 1.4 percent. Formerly vacant buildings house boutiques, gift shops, antique and craft shops; the town also has five art galleries, a library, three parks and two museums, including the Mine Museum run by the Jerome Historical Society, and a former church building that houses the society's offices and archives. Annual events include a home tour ("Paso de Casas") in May, a reunion for former mining families in October, and a Festival of Lights in December.
Gulch Radio KZRJ broadcasts from Jerome at 100.5 FM and <a href="Streaming%20media">streams</a> online. The Town of Jerome publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, "Point of View".

 Children from Jerome in <a href="Kindergarten%23United%20States">kindergarten</a> through eighth grade attend the Clarkdale–Jerome School in Clarkdale. Older students from Jerome are enrolled at <a href="Mingus%20Union%20High%20School">Mingus Union High School</a> in Cottonwood. Each of these communities had its own schools during the first half of the 20th century, but declining populations and shrinking tax revenues led to consolidation. The former Jerome High School complex is home in the 21st century to many artists' galleries.

In March 2017, the Jerome Historical Society acquired the former jail, now known as the Sliding Jail, from the Town of Jerome. Rendered unusable but not completely destroyed by earth movements since the 1930s, the jail is about downhill from where it was originally built. The society plans to rehabilitate the jail, which has become a popular tourist attraction. The project, including improvements to a sliding parking area nearby, is expected to be completed later in 2017.

Jerome manages its own water system, sourced by 10 mountain <a href="spring%20%28hydrology%29">springs</a>. The town's annual water report for 2016 assured residents that Jerome's water met all state and federal requirements and was safe to drink. Jerome administers its own sewer system, trash collection, and recycling services. Its public works department maintains the equipment and infrastructure associated with these systems as well the water system, streets, parks, and other city property.

<a href="Arizona%20Public%20Service">Arizona Public Service</a> provides electricity to Jerome, and <a href="UniSource%20Energy%20Services">UniSource Energy Services</a> is the supplier of natural gas. <a href="Century%20Link">Century Link</a> (<a href="DSL">DSL</a>), <a href="HughesNet">HughesNet</a> (satellite), Speed Connect (fixed wireless), and <a href="mobile%20Web">mobile Web</a> providers offer Internet access. <a href="Satellite%20television">Satellite television</a> is available via <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> and the <a href="Dish%20Network">Dish Network</a>. <a href="Mobile%20phone">Mobile phone</a> companies and Century Link offer telephone services.


The novel "Muckers" (2013) by Sandra Neil Wallace, a former sportscaster for <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, is a historical novel for young adults that is based on the Jerome High School football team of 1950. The team went undefeated that year, shortly before the copper mine closed and Jerome's population dwindled.

Stereolab

Stereolab were an English-French <a href="avant-pop">avant-pop</a> band formed in London in 1990. Led by the songwriting team of <a href="Tim%20Gane">Tim Gane</a> and <a href="L%C3%A6titia%20Sadier">Lætitia Sadier</a>, the group's music combined influences from <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a>, <a href="lounge%20music">lounge</a> and 1960s <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>, often incorporating a repetitive <a href="motorik">motorik</a> beat with heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French. On stage, they played in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. The band also drew from <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="Brazilian%20music">Brazilian music</a>, and were one of the first artists to be dubbed "<a href="post-rock">post-rock</a>". They are regarded among the most innovative and influential groups of the 1990s.

Stereolab was formed by Gane (guitar/keyboards) and Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar) after the break-up of <a href="McCarthy%20%28band%29">McCarthy</a>. The two were romantically involved for several years and were the group's only consistent members. Drawing from <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a> and <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist</a> movements, their songs were politically and philosophically charged, leading some critics to describe the group as <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>s, an accusation that Gane and Sadier denied. Other longtime members included 1992 addition <a href="Mary%20Hansen">Mary Hansen</a> (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who remained in the line-up until her accidental death in 2002, and 1993 addition Andy Ramsay (drums), who was still with the band as of 2009. <a href="The%20High%20Llamas">The High Llamas</a>' leader <a href="Sean%20O%27Hagan">Sean O'Hagan</a> (guitar/keyboards) was also a member from 1993 to 1994 and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances.

Although Stereolab found success in the underground music scene and were influential enough to spark a renewed interest in older <a href="analog%20synthesizer">analogue instruments</a>, they never had a significant commercial impact. The band were released from their recording contract with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> due to poor record sales. Since then, their self-owned label <a href="Duophonic%20Records">Duophonic</a> had signed a distribution deal with <a href="Too%20Pure">Too Pure</a>. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website that they were going on an indefinite hiatus. They are scheduled to reunite for multiple live performances in 2019.

In 1985, Tim Gane formed <a href="McCarthy%20%28band%29">McCarthy</a>, a band from <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, England, known for their left-wing politics. Gane met Lætitia Sadier, born in France, at a McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically-inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane immediately formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy's final album), ex-<a href="The%20Chills">Chills</a> bassist <a href="Martin%20Kean">Martin Kean</a> and Gina Morris on backing vocals. Stereolab's name was taken from a division of <a href="Vanguard%20Records">Vanguard Records</a> demonstrating <a href="hi-fi">hi-fi</a> effects.

Gane and Sadier, along with future band manager Martin Pike, created a record label called Duophonic Super 45s which, along with later offshoot Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, would become commonly known as "Duophonic". Gane said that their "original plan" was to distribute multiple 7 and 10 inch records "–to just do one a month and keep doing them in small editions". The 10 inch vinyl <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> "<a href="Super%2045">Super 45</a>", released in May 1991, was the first release for both Stereolab and the label, and was sold through mail order and through the <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Shop">Rough Trade Shop</a> in London. "Super 45"'s band-designed album art and packaging was the first of many customised and limited-edition Duophonic records. In a 1996 interview in "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>", Gane calls the "do-it-yourself" aesthetic behind Duophonic "empowering", and said that by releasing one's own music "you learn; it creates more music, more ideas".

Stereolab released the EP, "<a href="Super-Electric">Super-Electric</a>" in September 1991, and a single, titled "Stunning Debut Album", followed in November 1991 (which was neither debut nor album). The early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of "Super-Electric", Jason Ankeny wrote in <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> that "Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and pointillist melodies—were their calling cards ..." Under the independent label <a href="Too%20Pure">Too Pure</a>, the group's first full-length album, "<a href="Peng%21">Peng!</a>" was released in May 1992. A compilation titled, "<a href="Switched%20On">Switched On</a>", was released in October 1992 and would be part of a series of compilations that anthologise the band's more obscure material.

Around this time, the line-up consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist and guitarist <a href="Mary%20Hansen">Mary Hansen</a>, drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, and keyboardist Katharine Gifford. Hansen, born in Australia, had been in touch with Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab's sound. After a concert in the early 1990s, the band was introduced to <a href="Sean%20O%27Hagan">Sean O'Hagan</a>, who had recently formed the band <a href="the%20High%20Llamas">the High Llamas</a>. He recalled: "we got on very well. Their keyboard player left and they needed a quick replacement for a tour. I filled in but then was invited in on [their next] record. I was allowed to make suggestions and the fun started." 

Stereolab introduced <a href="easy-listening">easy-listening</a> elements into their sound with the EP "<a href="Space%20Age%20Bachelor%20Pad%20Music">Space Age Bachelor Pad Music</a>", released in March 1993. The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>. Their first album under Elektra, "<a href="Transient%20Random-Noise%20Bursts%20with%20Announcements">Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements</a>" (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" that with the album, Stereolab "continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums. 

In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP "<a href="Jenny%20Ondioline">Jenny Ondioline</a>", entered at number 75 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP "<a href="Miss%20Modular">Miss Modular</a>" in 1997.) Their third album, "<a href="Mars%20Audiac%20Quintet">Mars Audiac Quintet</a>", was released in August 1994. The album contains the single "<a href="Ping%20Pong%20%28EP%29">Ping Pong</a>", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as "what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled "<a href="Music%20for%20the%20Amorphous%20Body%20Study%20Center">Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center</a>" in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long. Their second compilation of rarities, titled "<a href="Refried%20Ectoplasm">Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On, Vol. 2)</a>", was released in July 1995.

The band's fourth album, "<a href="Emperor%20Tomato%20Ketchup%20%28album%29">Emperor Tomato Ketchup</a>" (March 1996), was a critical success and was played heavily on <a href="college%20radio">college radio</a>. A record that "captivated alternative rock", it represented the group's "high-water mark" said music journalists Tom Moon and Joshua Klein, respectively. The album incorporated their early krautrock sound with funk, hip-hop influences and experimental instrumental arrangements. <a href="John%20McEntire">John McEntire</a> of Tortoise also assisted with production and played on the album. Katharine Gifford was replaced by Morgane Lhote before recording, and bassist Duncan Brown by Richard Harrison after. Lhote was required to both learn the keyboards and 30 of the group's songs before joining.

Released in September 1997, "<a href="Dots%20and%20Loops">Dots and Loops</a>" was their first album to enter the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200 charts</a>, peaking at number 111. The album leaned towards jazz with <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a> and <a href="1960s%20in%20music">60's pop</a> influences. A review in German newspaper "<a href="Die%20Zeit">Die Zeit</a>" stated that in "Dots and Loops", Stereolab transformed the harder Velvet Underground-like riffs of previous releases into "softer sounds and noisy playfulness". Contributors to the album included John McEntire and Jan St. Werner of German electropop duo <a href="Mouse%20on%20Mars">Mouse on Mars</a>. Stereolab toured for seven months and took a break when Gane and Sadier had a child. The group's third compilation of rarities, "<a href="Aluminum%20Tunes">Aluminum Tunes</a>", was issued in October 1998.

Their sixth album, "<a href="Cobra%20and%20Phases%20Group%20Play%20Voltage%20in%20the%20Milky%20Night">Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night</a>", was released in September 1999. It was co-produced by McEntire and American producer <a href="Jim%20O%27Rourke%20%28musician%29">Jim O'Rourke</a>, and was recorded with their new bassist, Simon Johns. The album received mixed reviews for its lighter sound, and peaked at number 154 on the "Billboard" 200. An unsigned "<a href="NME">NME</a>" review said that "this record has far more in common with bad jazz and progressive rock than any experimental art-rock tradition." In a 1999 article of "Washington Post", Mark Jenkins asked Gane about the album's apparent lack of guitars; Gane responded, "There's a lot less upfront, distorted guitar ... But it's still quite guitar-based music. Every single track has a guitar on it."

Stereolab's seventh album, "<a href="Sound-Dust">Sound-Dust</a>" (August 2001), rose to number 178 on the "Billboard" 200. The album also featured producers McEntire and O'Rourke. "Sound-Dust" was more warmly received than "Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night". Critic Joshua Klein said that "the emphasis this time sounds less on unfocused experimentation and more on melody ... a breezy and welcome return to form for the British band." Erlewine of Allmusic stated that the album "[finds the group] deliberately recharging their creative juices" but he argued that "Sound-Dust" was "anchored in overly familiar territory."

In 2002, as they were planning their next album, Stereolab started building a studio north of <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, France. "<a href="ABC%20Music%20%28Stereolab%20album%29">ABC Music: The Radio 1 Sessions</a>"; a compilation of <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> sessions was released in October. In the same year, Gane and Sadier's romantic relationship ended.

On 9 December 2002, Hansen was killed when hit by a truck while riding her bicycle. Writer Pierre Perrone said that her "playful nature and mischievous sense of humour came through in the way she approached the backing vocals she contributed to Stereolab and the distinctive harmonies she created with Sadier." For the next few months, Stereolab laid dormant as the members grieved. They eventually decided to continue. Future album and concert reviews would mention the effects of Hansen's absence. 

The EP "<a href="Instant%200%20in%20the%20Universe">Instant 0 in the Universe</a>" (October 2003) was recorded in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. Music journalist Jim DeRogatis said that the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke".

Stereolab's eighth album, "<a href="Margerine%20Eclipse">Margerine Eclipse</a>", was released on 27 January 2004 with generally positive reviews, and peaked at number 174 on the US Billboard 200. The track "Feel and Triple" was written in tribute to Hansen; Sadier said, "I was reflecting on my years with her ... reflecting on how we sometimes found it hard to express the love we had for one another." Sadier continued, "Our dedication to her on the album says, 'We will love you till the end', meaning of our lives. I'm not religious, but I feel Mary's energy is still around somewhere. It didn't just disappear." The "<a href="The%20Observer">Observer</a>"'s Molloy Woodcraft gave the album four out of five stars, and commented that Sadier's vocal performance as "life- and love-affirming", and the record as a whole as "Complex and catchy, bold and beatific." Kelefa Sanneh commented in "Rolling Stone" that "Margerine Eclipse" was "full of familiar noises and aimless melodies". "Margerine Eclipse" was Stereolab's last record to be released on American label Elektra Records, which shut down that same year. Future material would be released on Too Pure, the same label which had released some of the band's earliest material.

The group released six limited-edition singles in 2005 and 2006, which were anthologised in the 2006 compilation "<a href="Fab%20Four%20Suture">Fab Four Suture</a>", and contained material which Mark Jenkins thought continued the brisker sound of the band's post-Hansen work. By June 2007, Stereolab's line-up comprised Tim Gane, Lætitia Sadier, Andy Ramsay, Simon Johns, Dominic Jeffrey, Joseph Watson, and Joseph Walters. In 2008, the band issued their next album under the label <a href="4AD">4AD</a> titled, "<a href="Chemical%20Chords">Chemical Chords</a>", which "[downplays] their arsenal of analog synths in favor of live instrumentation". The release was followed by an autumn tour in Europe, the United States and Canada. 
In February 2009, they toured Australia as part of the <a href="St%20Jerome%27s%20Laneway%20Festival">St Jerome's Laneway Festival</a>.

In April 2009, Stereolab manager Martin Pike announced a pause in their activities for the time being. He said that it was an opportune time for the members to move on to other projects. "<a href="Not%20Music">Not Music</a>", a collection of unreleased material recorded at the same time as "Chemical Chords", was released in 2010. In 2013, Gane and Sadier, who both focused on Cavern of Anti-Matter and solo work respectively, performed at the <a href="All%20Tomorrow%27s%20Parties%20%28music%20festival%29">All Tomorrow's Parties</a> festival held at Pontins in <a href="Camber%20Sands">Camber Sands</a>.

In 2018, Stereolab were announced as part of the lineup for 2019’s Primavera Sound festival, taking part on the weekend of May 30 in Barcelona, Spain and in the following weekend in Porto, Portugal. It will be the group's first live performance since 2009. In February 2019, the group announced a tour of Europe and North America to coincide with expanded, remastered reissues of several of the albums.

Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with <a href="lounge%20music">lounge</a> instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and have also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as <a href="avant-pop">avant-pop</a>, <a href="indie%20pop">indie pop</a>, <a href="art%20pop">art pop</a>, <a href="indie%20electronic">indie electronic</a>, <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a>, <a href="post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental rock</a>, and <a href="experimental%20pop">experimental pop</a>.

The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as <a href="Farfisa">Farfisa</a> and <a href="Vox%20%28musical%20equipment%29">Vox</a> and <a href="Moog%20Music">Moog</a>. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: "We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things." The 1994 album "<a href="Mars%20Audiac%20Quintet">Mars Audiac Quintet</a>" prominently features <a href="Moog%20synthesizer">Moog synthesizers</a>.

Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, <a href="Peter%20Shapiro%20%28journalist%29">Peter Shapiro</a> wrote facetiously in "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">Wire</a>" that Sadier "display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of <a href="Nico">Nico</a>", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as "eerie" and "hypnotic", as well as "sweet [and] slightly alien". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.

In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that "to be unique was more important than to be good." On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that "maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we're doing." Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she "think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not." The duo were up-front about their desire to grow their sound: for Gane, "otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing", and for Sadier, "you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting."

Their records have been heavily influenced by the "<a href="motorik">motorik</a>" technique of 1970s <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a> groups such as <a href="Neu%21">Neu!</a> and <a href="Faust%20%28band%29">Faust</a>. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: "Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way." Dave Heaton of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" said that their music also had "echoes of bubblegum, of <a href="exotica">exotica</a>, of <a href="Beach%20Boys">Beach Boys</a> and <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a>", with their earlier work "bearing strong <a href="Velvet%20Underground">Velvet Underground</a> overtones". <a href="Funk%20music">Funk</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, and <a href="Brazilian%20music">Brazilian music</a> were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" said that "<a href="Emperor%20Tomato%20Ketchup%20%28album%29">Emperor Tomato Ketchup</a>" (1996) had musical influences such as <a href="Burt%20Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a>, and <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20Hardy">Françoise Hardy</a>. The sounds influenced by <a href="minimalist%20music">minimalist</a> composers <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> and <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a> can be found on the 1999 album "<a href="Cobra%20and%20Phases%20Group%20Play%20Voltage%20in%20the%20Milky%20Night">Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night</a>." The same album, according to Rick Reger of "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", "charts [a course] somewhere between the Beach Boys and <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>." Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. <a href="Barney%20Hoskyns">Barney Hoskyns</a> wrote in a review for "<a href="Dots%20and%20Loops">Dots and Loops</a>" (1997) that the group moved "away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days" toward easy-listening and Europop. Joshua Klein in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" said that, "Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands <a href="Can%20%28band%29">Can</a> and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master <a href="Juan%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Esquivel">Esquivel</a> and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach." Regarding their later work such as "<a href="Instant%200%20in%20the%20Universe">Instant 0 in the Universe</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Margerine%20Eclipse">Margerine Eclipse</a>" (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style.

Stereolab toured regularly to support their album releases. In a 1996 "Washington Post" gig review, Mark Jenkins wrote that Stereolab started out favouring an "easy-listening syncopation", but eventually reverted to a "messier, more urgent sound" characteristic of their earlier performances. In another review Jenkins said that the band's live songs "frequently veer[ed] into more cacophonous, guitar-dominated territory", in contrast to their albums such as "Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night". In the "<a href="Minneapolis%20Star%20Tribune">Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>" Jon Bream compared the band's live sound to feedback-driven rock bands like the Velvet Underground, <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> and <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a>. Stereolab's stage presence would be negatively received by critics, commenting that Sadier's vocal delivery was too subdued and that the band tended to play instead of perform its music. Regarding being onstage, Gane has said that "I don't like to be the center of attention ... I just get into the music and am not really aware of the people there. That's my way of getting through it."

Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" said that the group "[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound." The lyrics of the 2006 compilation "<a href="Fab%20Four%20Suture">Fab Four Suture</a>", contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and "the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all", in contrast to "humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same." Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was strongly influenced by the <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist</a> philosophy "<a href="Society%20of%20the%20Spectacle">Society of the Spectacle</a>" by <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> theorist <a href="Guy%20Debord">Guy Debord</a>. Her more recent inspiration was her anger towards the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. The <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a>, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" interview.

Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than "affairs of the heart". The 1994 single "<a href="Ping%20Pong%20%28EP%29">Ping Pong</a>" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings "about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery" with lyrics that constitute "a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).

Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that "none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx." Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into "sloganeering". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, <a href="Cornelius%20Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a>, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking. The name of her side project, <a href="Monade">Monade</a>, and its debut album title, "Socialisme ou Barbarie", are also references to the work of Castoriadis.

Stereolab's album and song titles occasionally reference <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> political groups and artists. Gane said that the title of their 1999 album "<a href="Cobra%20and%20Phases%20Group%20Play%20Voltage%20in%20the%20Milky%20Night">Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night</a>" contains the names of two Surrealist organisations, "<a href="COBRA%20%28avant-garde%20movement%29">CoBrA</a>" and "Phases Group", The title of the song "Brakhage" from "<a href="Dots%20and%20Loops">Dots and Loops</a>" (1997), is a nod to experimental filmmaker <a href="Stan%20Brakhage">Stan Brakhage</a>. Other examples are the 1992 compilation "<a href="Switched%20On">Switched On</a>", named after <a href="Wendy%20Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>' 1968 album <a href="Switched%20on%20Bach">"Switched On Bach"</a>, and the 1993 song "<a href="Jenny%20Ondioline">Jenny Ondioline</a>", an interlock of inventor <a href="Georges%20Jenny">Georges Jenny</a> and his instrument the <a href="Ondioline">Ondioline</a>.

Stereolab have been called one of the most "influential" and "fiercely independent and original groups of the Nineties" by writers Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Pierre Perrone respectively; as well as one of "the decade's most innovative British bands." by Mark Jenkins. Simon Reynolds commented in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that the group's earlier records form "an endlessly seductive body of work that sounds always the same, always different." In a review for the 1992 single "John Cage Bubblegum", Jason Ankeny said that "No other artist of its generation fused the high-minded daring of the avant-garde and the lowbrow infectiousness of pop with as much invention, skill, and appeal." In "The Wire", Peter Shapiro compared the band to <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> bands <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> and <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a>, and defended their music against the charge that it is "nothing but the sum total of its arcane reference points." They were one of the first groups to be termed <a href="post-rock">post-rock</a>—in a 1996 article, journalist Angela Lewis applied the "new term" to Stereolab and three other bands who have connections to the group. Stylistically, music journalist <a href="J.%20D.%20Considine">J. D. Considine</a> credits the band for anticipating and driving the late 1990s revival of vintage analogue instruments among indie rock bands.

The group have also received negative press. <a href="Barney%20Hoskyns">Barney Hoskyns</a> questioned the longevity of their music in a 1996 "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" review, saying that their records "sound more like arid experiments than music born of emotional need." In "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>," Dave Simpson stated: "With their borrowings from early, obscure Kraftwerk and hip obtuse sources, [Stereolab] sound like a band of rock critics rather than musicians." Lætitia Sadier's vocals were cited by author Stuart Shea as often being "indecipherable".

A variety of artists, musical and otherwise, have collaborated with Stereolab. In 1995 the group teamed up with sculptor Charles Long for an interactive art show in New York City, for which Long provided the exhibits and Stereolab the music. They have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band <a href="Tortoise%20%28band%29">Tortoise</a>, while <a href="John%20McEntire">John McEntire</a> of Tortoise has in turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s, the group collaborated with the industrial band <a href="Nurse%20with%20Wound">Nurse With Wound</a> and released two albums together, "<a href="Crumb%20Duck">Crumb Duck</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Simple%20Headphone%20Mind">Simple Headphone Mind</a>" (1998), and Stereolab also released "Calimero" (1998) with French avant-garde singer and poet <a href="Brigitte%20Fontaine">Brigitte Fontaine</a>. The band worked with <a href="Herbie%20Mann">Herbie Mann</a> on the song "One Note Samba/Surfboard" for the 1998 AIDS-Benefit album, "<a href="Red%20Hot%20%2B%20Rio">Red Hot + Rio</a>", produced by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Organization">Red Hot Organization</a>.

Stereolab alumni have also founded bands of their own. Guitarist Tim Gane founded the side project Cavern of Anti-Matter and also formed Turn On alongside band member <a href="Sean%20O%27Hagan">Sean O'Hagan</a>, who formed his own band <a href="the%20High%20Llamas">the High Llamas</a>. Katharine Gifford formed <a href="Snowpony">Snowpony</a> with former <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a> bassist <a href="Debbie%20Googe">Debbie Googe</a>. Sadier has released three albums with her four-piece side-project <a href="Monade">Monade</a>, whose sound Mark Jenkins called a "little more Parisian" than Stereolab's. Backing vocalist <a href="Mary%20Hansen">Mary Hansen</a> formed a band named Schema with members of <a href="Hovercraft%20%28band%29">Hovercraft</a> and released their eponymous EP in 2000.

As of August 1999, US album sales stood at 300,000 copies sold. Despite receiving critical acclaim and a sizeable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP "<a href="Jenny%20Ondioline">Jenny Ondioline</a>" entered the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> was closed down by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> in 2004, Stereolab was dropped along with many other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Tim Gane said in retrospect that that the group "signed to Elektra because we thought we would be on there for an album or two and then we'd get ejected. We were surprised when we got to our first album!" Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label <a href="Duophonic%20Records">Duophonic</a> has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label <a href="Too%20Pure">Too Pure</a>. Through Duophonic, the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). Gane said, "... we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. We just want to be in control of our own music."

In hip-hop culture, the song "Come And Play in the Milky Night" was sampled by American producer <a href="J%20Dilla">J Dilla</a> for "Show Me What You Got" by <a href="Busta%20Rhymes">Busta Rhymes</a>, Sadier was featured in the track "PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer" by <a href="Tyler%2C%20the%20Creator">Tyler, The Creator</a> in his <a href="Wolf%20%28Tyler%2C%20the%20Creator%20album%29">"Wolf"</a> album, and <a href="Pharrell%20Williams">Pharrell Williams</a> "is a fan" of the song "The Flower Called Nowhere".

Stereolab released many non-LP tracks that they later anthologised as compilation albums.

Cædmon

Cædmon (; "fl. c." AD 657–684) is the earliest English (<a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n) <a href="English%20poetry">poet</a> whose name is known. An <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> who cared for the animals at the <a href="double%20monastery">double monastery</a> of Streonæshalch (<a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby Abbey</a>) during the abbacy (657–680) of <a href="Hilda%20of%20Whitby">St. Hilda</a> (614–680), he was originally ignorant of "the art of song" but learned to compose one night in the course of a dream, according to the 8th-century historian <a href="Bede">Bede</a>. He later became a zealous <a href="monk">monk</a> and an accomplished and inspirational <a href="Christian%20poetry">Christian poet</a>.

Cædmon is one of twelve <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20literature">Anglo-Saxon poets</a> identified in <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> sources, and one of only three of these for whom both roughly contemporary biographical information and examples of literary output have survived. His story is related in the "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>" ("Ecclesiastical History of the English People") by Bede who wrote, "[t]here was in the Monastery of this Abbess a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of <a href="Bible">scripture</a>, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven."

Cædmon's only known surviving work is "<a href="C%C3%A6dmon%27s%20Hymn">Cædmon's Hymn</a>", the nine-line <a href="Alliterative%20verse">alliterative</a> <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> praise poem in honour of God which he supposedly learned to sing in his initial dream. The poem is one of the earliest attested examples of <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> and is, with the <a href="runic">runic</a> <a href="Ruthwell%20Cross">Ruthwell Cross</a> and <a href="Franks%20Casket">Franks Casket</a> inscriptions, one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20literature">Old English poetry</a>. It is also one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language. In 1898, Cædmon's Cross was erected in his honour in the graveyard of <a href="Church%20of%20Saint%20Mary%2C%20Whitby">St Mary's Church</a> in <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a>.

The sole source of original information about Cædmon's life and work is <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "Historia ecclesiastica". According to Bede, Cædmon was a <a href="lay%20brother">lay brother</a> who cared for the animals at the monastery Streonæshalch (now known as <a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby Abbey</a>). One evening, while the monks were feasting, singing, and playing a harp, Cædmon left early to sleep with the animals because he knew no songs. The impression clearly given by St. Bede is that he lacked the knowledge of how to compose the lyrics to songs. While asleep, he had a dream in which "someone" ("quidam") approached him and asked him to sing "principium creaturarum", "the beginning of created things." After first refusing to sing, Cædmon subsequently produced a short <a href="eulogy">eulogistic</a> poem praising God, the Creator of heaven and earth.

Upon awakening the next morning, Cædmon remembered everything he had sung and added additional lines to his poem. He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the <a href="abbess">abbess</a>, believed to be <a href="Hilda%20of%20Whitby">St Hilda of Whitby</a>. The abbess and her counselors asked Cædmon about his vision and, satisfied that it was a gift from God, gave him a new commission, this time for a poem based on "a passage of sacred history or doctrine", by way of a test. When Cædmon returned the next morning with the requested poem, he was invited to take <a href="monastic%20vows">monastic vows</a>. The abbess ordered her scholars to teach Cædmon sacred history and doctrine, which after a night of thought, Bede records, Cædmon would turn into the most beautiful verse. According to Bede, Cædmon was responsible for a large number of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics.

After a long and zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a <a href="saint">saint</a>: receiving a <a href="premonition">premonition</a> of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before <a href="nocturns">nocturns</a>. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect.

The details of Bede's story, and in particular of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt the existence of a poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read in the context of the Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.

Bede gives no specific dates in his story. Cædmon is said to have taken <a href="Holy%20Orders">holy orders</a> at an advanced age and it is implied that he lived at Streonæshalch at least in part during Hilda's abbacy (657–680). Book IV Chapter 25 of the "Historia ecclesiastica" appears to suggest that Cædmon's death occurred at about the same time as the fire at <a href="Coldingham%20Priory">Coldingham Abbey</a>, an event dated in the E text of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" to 679, but after 681 by Bede. The reference to "his temporibus" "at this time" in the opening lines of Chapter 25 may refer more generally to Cædmon's career as a poet. However, the next datable event in the "Historia ecclesiastica" is King <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a>'s raid on <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> in 684 (Book IV, Chapter 26). Taken together, this evidence suggests an active period beginning between 657 and 680 and ending between 679 and 684.

The only biographical or historical information that modern scholarship has been able to add to Bede's account concerns the Brittonic origins of the poet's name. Although Bede specifically notes that English was Cædmon's "own" language, the poet's name is of <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic origin: from <a href="Old%20Welsh">Proto-Welsh</a> "Cadṽan" (from <a href="British%20language%20%28Celtic%29">Brythonic</a> "Catumandos"). Several scholars have suggested that Cædmon himself may have been bilingual on the basis of this etymology, Hilda's close contact with Celtic political and religious hierarchies, and some (not very close) analogues to the "Hymn" in <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a> poetry. Other scholars have noticed a possible <a href="Onomastics">onomastic</a> allusion to '<a href="Adam%20Kadmon">Adam Kadmon</a>' in the poet's name, perhaps suggesting that the entire story is allegorical.

No other independent accounts of Cædmon's life and work are known to exist. The only other reference to Cædmon in English sources before the 12th century is found in the 10th-century Old English translation of Bede's Latin "Historia". Otherwise, no mention of Cædmon is found in the corpus of surviving Old English. The Old English translation of the "Historia ecclesiastica" does contain several minor details not found in Bede's Latin original account. Of these, the most significant is that Cædmon felt "shame" for his inability to sing vernacular songs before his vision, and the suggestion that Hilda's scribes copied down his verse "æt muðe" "from his mouth". These differences are in keeping with the Old English translator's practice in reworking Bede's Latin original, however, and need not, as Wrenn argues, suggest the existence of an independent English tradition of the Cædmon story.

A second, possibly pre-12th-century allusion to the Cædmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the <a href="Old%20Saxon">Old Saxon</a> "<a href="Heliand">Heliand</a>" poem. These texts, the "Praefatio" (Preface) and "Versus de Poeta" (Lines about the poet), explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation (for which the "Heliand" is the only known candidate) in language strongly reminiscent of, and indeed at times identical to, Bede's account of Cædmon's career. According to the prose "Praefatio", the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a>; the text then adds that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until he was ordered to translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream. The "Versus de Poeta" contain an expanded account of the dream itself, adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself had come through the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle. While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th-century edition by <a href="Matthias%20Flacius">Flacius Illyricus</a>, both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition. This apparent debt to the Cædmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Anglo Saxon biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures.

In contrast to his usual practice elsewhere in the "Historia ecclesiastica", Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby <a href="Wearmouth-Jarrow">Wearmouth-Jarrow</a>.

Perhaps as a result of this lack of documentation, scholars have devoted considerable attention since the 1830s to tracking down possible sources or analogues to Bede's account. These parallels have been drawn from all around the world, including <a href="Bible">biblical</a> and <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a>, stories told by the aboriginal peoples of <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Australia</a>, <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">North America</a> and the <a href="Fijians">Fiji Islands</a>, mission-age accounts of the conversion of the <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> in Southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, the lives of English <a href="Romantic%20poetry">romantic poets</a>, and various elements of <a href="Hindu%20scripture">Hindu</a> and <a href="Qur%27an">Muslim scripture</a> and tradition. Although the search was begun by scholars such as <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Palgrave">Sir Francis Palgrave</a>, who hoped either to find Bede's source for the Cædmon story or to demonstrate that its details were so commonplace as to hardly merit consideration as legitimate historiography, subsequent research has instead ended up demonstrating the uniqueness of Bede's version: as Lester shows, no "analogue" to the Cædmon story found before 1974 parallels Bede's chapter in more than about half its key features; the same observation can be extended to cover all analogues since identified.

Bede's account indicates that Cædmon was responsible for the composition of a large <a href="%3Awikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a> of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a> and <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, Cædmon's poetry is said to have been exclusively religious. Bede reports that Cædmon "could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion", and his list of Cædmon's output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>s, and songs about the "terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, … joys of the heavenly kingdom, … and divine mercies and judgments." Of this corpus, only his first poem survives. While vernacular poems matching Bede's description of several of Cædmon's later works are found in <a href="Caedmon%20manuscript">London, British Library, Junius 11</a> (traditionally referred to as the "Junius" or "Cædmon" manuscript), the older traditional attribution of these texts to Cædmon or Cædmon's influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with Cædmon's original "Hymn", and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede's discussion of Cædmon's oeuvre: the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while "<a href="Christ%20and%20Satan">Christ and Satan</a>" could be understood as partially fitting Bede's description of Cædmon's work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, indeed, Bede's list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of Cædmon's actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the <a href="catechism">catechism</a>. Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.

The only known survivor from Cædmon's oeuvre is his "Hymn" (<a href="http%3A//www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/noa/mp3/audio_ma_02.mp3">audio version</a>). The poem is known from 21 <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> copies, making it the best-attested Old English poem after <a href="Bede">Bede's "Death Song"</a> (with 35 <a href="Textual%20criticism">witnesses</a>) and the best attested in the poetic corpus in manuscripts copied or owned in the British Isles during the Anglo-Saxon period. The "Hymn" also has by far the most complicated known textual history of any surviving Anglo-Saxon poem. It is found in two dialects and five distinct <a href="recension">recension</a>s (Northumbrian "aelda", Northumbrian "eordu", West-Saxon "eorðan", West-Saxon "ylda", and West-Saxon "eorðe"), all but one of which are known from three or more witnesses. It is one of the earliest attested examples of written Old English and one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic language</a>. Together with the runic <a href="Ruthwell%20Cross">Ruthwell Cross</a> and <a href="Franks%20Casket">Franks Casket</a> inscriptions, "Cædmon's Hymn" is one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of <a href="Old%20English%20literature">Old English poetry</a>.

There is continuing critical debate about the status of the poem as it is now available to us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon's original, others argue that they originated as a back-translation from Bede's Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.

All copies of "Hymn" are found in manuscripts of the "Historia ecclesiastica" or its translation, where they serve as either a <a href="gloss%20%28annotation%29">gloss</a> to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, in the case of the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the "Hymn" does not appear to have been transmitted with the "Historia ecclesiastica" regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the "Hymn" in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, "Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243", "Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43", and "Winchester, Cathedral I", the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin "Historia": nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin "Historia" sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the "Historia ecclesiastica" is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.

The oldest known version of the poem is the <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n "aelda" <a href="recension">recension</a>. The surviving witnesses to this text, <a href="Cambridge%2C%20University%20Library%2C%20Kk.%205.%2016">Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16</a> (M) and <a href="Leningrad%20Bede">St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18</a> (P), date to at least the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede's own monastery and lifetime, though there is little evidence to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.

The following text, first column on the left below, has been transcribed from M (mid-8th century; Northumbria). The text has been normalised to show a line-break between each line and modern word-division. A transcription of the likely pronunciation of the text in the early 8th-century Northumbrian dialect in which the text is written is included, along with a modern English translation.

Bede's Latin version runs as follows:

Vineland, New Jersey

Vineland is a <a href="City%20%28New%20Jersey%29">city</a> in <a href="Cumberland%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cumberland County</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, United States. As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>, the city had a total population of 60,724, reflecting an increase of 4,453 (+7.9%) from the 56,271 counted in the <a href="2000%20United%20States%20Census">2000 Census</a>, which had in turn increased by 1,491 (+2.7%) from the 54,780 counted in the <a href="1990%20United%20States%20Census">1990 Census</a>. Vineland, <a href="Millville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Millville</a> and <a href="Bridgeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bridgeton</a> are the three principal New Jersey cities of the Vineland–Millville–Bridgeton <a href="Primary%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area">Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, which encompasses those three cities and all of Cumberland County for statistical purposes and had a population of 156,898 as of the 2010 Census.

Vineland was formed on July 1, 1952, through the merger of <a href="Landis%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Landis Township</a> and <a href="Vineland%20Borough%2C%20New%20Jersey">Vineland Borough</a>, based on the results of a referendum held on February 5, 1952. Festivities on July 1, 1952, when the merger took effect, included a parade and speeches from such notables as Senator <a href="Estes%20Kefauver">Estes Kefauver</a>. The name is derived from the plans of its founder to use the land to grow grapes.

<a href="Charles%20K.%20Landis">Charles K. Landis</a> purchased of land in 1861 and another in 1874, near <a href="Millville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Millville, New Jersey</a>, and along the <a href="West%20Jersey%20and%20Seashore%20Railroad">West Jersey</a> railroad line with service between <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden</a> and <a href="Cape%20May%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cape May</a>, to create his own alcohol-free utopian society based on agriculture and progressive thinking. The first houses were built in 1862, and train service was established to Philadelphia and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, with the population reaching 5,500 by 1865 and 11,000 by 1875.

Established as a <a href="Temperance%20Towns">Temperance Town</a>, where the sale of alcohol was prohibited, Landis required that purchasers of land in Vineland build a house on the purchased property within a year of purchase, that of the often heavily wooded land be cleared and farmed each year, and that adequate space be placed between houses and roads to allow for planting of flowers and shade trees along the routes through town. Landis Avenue was constructed as a wide and about long road running east-west through the center of the community, with other, narrower roads connecting at right angles to each other.

After determining that the Vineland soil was well-suited for growing grapes (hence the name), Landis started advertising to attract <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> grape growers to Vineland, offering of land that had to be cleared and used to grow grapes. <a href="Thomas%20Bramwell%20Welch">Thomas Bramwell Welch</a> founded <a href="Welch%27s">Welch's Grape Juice</a>, and purchased the locally grown grapes to make "unfermented wine" (or grape juice). The fertile ground also attracted the glass-making industry and was home to the <a href="Progresso">Progresso</a> soup company. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, most of the city was involved in the <a href="poultry">poultry</a> industry, which led to the city being dubbed "The Egg Basket of America."

Vineland Poultry Laboratories (operations were closed by Lohmann Animal Health in 2007) was started by Arthur Goldhaft. Dr. Goldhaft is credited with putting "a chicken in every pot" after developing the <a href="fowl%20pox">fowl pox</a> <a href="chicken">chicken</a> <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> that saved millions of chickens from death. Dr. Goldhaft's work at Vineland Poultry Laboratories in Vineland, helped protect the world's chicken supply from the fowl pox disease.

Vineland had New Jersey's first school for the <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectually disabled</a>, the Vineland Developmental Center, which now has an east and west campus. These institutions housed mentally handicapped women in fully staffed cottages. <a href="Henry%20H.%20Goddard">Henry H. Goddard</a>, an American psychologist, coined the term "<a href="Moron%20%28psychology%29">Moron</a>" while directing the Research Laboratory at the <a href="Vineland%20Training%20School">Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children</a> in Vineland. This facility was so sufficiently well known that one <a href="American%20Prison%20Association">American Prison Association</a> pamphlet in 1955 heralded Vineland as "famous for its contributions to our knowledge of the feebleminded".

The city of Vineland celebrated its 150th birthday in 2011. Mayor Robert Romano initially ordered a custom cake from Buddy Valastro of <a href="Carlo%27s%20Bake%20Shop">Carlo's Bake Shop</a> in <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken</a>; the business is featured in the <a href="TLC%20%28TV%20channel%29">TLC</a> <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a> series "<a href="Cake%20Boss">Cake Boss</a>". After outcry from local business owners, the order was canceled and five Vineland bakeries were commissioned to create elaborate cakes for the event.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city had a total area of 69.029 square miles (178.785 km), including 68.424 square miles (177.218 km) of land and 0.605 square miles (1.568 km) of water (0.88%). Of all the municipalities in New Jersey to hold the label of City, Vineland is the largest in total area. (<a href="Hamilton%20Township%2C%20Atlantic%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hamilton Township</a> in <a href="Atlantic%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic County</a> is the largest municipality in New Jersey in terms of land area. <a href="Galloway%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Galloway Township</a>, also in Atlantic County, is the largest municipality in total area, including open water within its borders.)

Vineland borders <a href="Deerfield%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Deerfield Township</a>, <a href="Millville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Millville</a>, and <a href="Maurice%20River%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Maurice River Township</a>.

The city is approximately from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.

<a href="Local%20government%20in%20New%20Jersey%23Unincorporated%20communities">Unincorporated communities</a>, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Clayville, Hances Bridge, Leamings Mill, Menantico, North Vineland, Parvins Branch, Pleasantville, South Vineland and Willow Grove.

Vineland has a Ukrainian community and is home to the Ukrainian Evangelical Baptist Church among several other Ukrainian churches.

The Census Bureau's 2006-2010 <a href="American%20Community%20Survey">American Community Survey</a> showed that (in 2010 <a href="inflation%20adjustment">inflation-adjusted</a> dollars) <a href="median%20household%20income">median household income</a> was $54,024 (with a margin of error of +/- $2,798) and the median family income was $64,185 (+/- $2,216).

Nancy Mitford

Nancy Freeman-Mitford (28 November 1904 – 30 June 1973), known as Nancy Mitford, was an English novelist, biographer and journalist. One of the renowned <a href="Mitford%20family%23Mitford%20sisters">Mitford sisters</a> and one of the "<a href="Bright%20young%20things">Bright Young People</a>" on the London social scene in the <a href="Interwar%20period">inter-war years</a>, she is best remembered for her novels about upper-class life in England and France and for her sharp and often provocative wit. She also established a reputation for herself as a writer of popular historical biographies.

Mitford enjoyed a privileged childhood as the eldest daughter of the <a href="David%20Freeman-Mitford%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Redesdale">Hon. David Freeman-Mitford, later 2nd Baron Redesdale</a>. Educated privately, she had no training as a writer before publishing her first novel in 1931. This early effort and the three that followed it created little stir; it was her two semi-autobiographical postwar novels, "<a href="The%20Pursuit%20of%20Love">The Pursuit of Love</a>" (1945) and "<a href="Love%20in%20a%20Cold%20Climate">Love in a Cold Climate</a>" (1949), that established her reputation. Mitford's marriage to <a href="Peter%20Rodd">Peter Rodd</a> in 1933 proved unsatisfactory to both (they divorced in 1957 after a lengthy separation), and during the Second World War she formed a liaison with a <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> officer, <a href="Gaston%20Palewski">Gaston Palewski</a>. He became the love of her life, although the pair were never a formal couple. After the war Mitford settled in France and lived there until her death, maintaining social contact with her many English friends through letters and regular visits.

During the 1950s Mitford was identified with the concept of <a href="U%20and%20non-U%20English">"U" (upper) and "non-U" language</a>, whereby social origins and standing were identified by words used in everyday speech. She had intended this as a joke, but many took it seriously, and Mitford was considered an authority on manners and breeding—possibly her most recognised legacy. Her later years were bitter-sweet, the success of her biographical studies of <a href="Madame%20de%20Pompadour">Madame de Pompadour</a>, <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">King Louis XIV</a> contrasting with the ultimate failure of her relationship with Palewski. From the late 1960s her health deteriorated, and she endured several years of painful illness before her death in 1973.

The Mitford family dates from the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman era</a>, when Sir John de Mitford held the <a href="Mitford%20Castle">Castle of Mitford</a> in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. A later Sir John held several important public offices during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and the family maintained a tradition of public service for many generations. In the 18th century <a href="William%20Mitford">William Mitford</a> was a leading classical historian, responsible for the definitive history of ancient Greece. His great-grandson <a href="Algernon%20Freeman-Mitford%2C%201st%20Baron%20Redesdale">Algernon Bertram Mitford</a>, born in 1837 and known as "Bertie", was a diplomat and traveller who held minor office in <a href="Second%20Disraeli%20ministry">Disraeli's second ministry, from 1874 to 1880</a>. In 1874 he married Clementina, the second daughter of <a href="David%20Ogilvy%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Airlie">David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie</a>, a union that linked the Mitfords to some of Britain's most prominent aristocratic families. Blanche Ogilvy, Clementina's elder sister, became the wife of Sir Henry Montague Hozier, a soldier turned businessman. Their four children included daughters <a href="Clementine%20Churchill%2C%20Baroness%20Spencer-Churchill">Clementine</a> ("Clemmie"), who in 1908 married the future British prime minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, and Nellie who married Bertram Romilly. Both Hozier and Blanche were promiscuous, and it is generally accepted by historians and family members that Hozier was not Clemmie's father, although he was registered as such. Blanche told her friend Lady Londonderry, shortly before Clemmie's birth, that the father of the expected child was her own brother-in-law, Bertie Mitford; most historians believe that other candidates for the paternity are more likely.

Bertie Mitford's marriage produced five sons and four daughters. His career in government service ended in 1886, when after the death of a cousin he inherited a considerable fortune. <a href="Name%20change%23Historical%20usage">A condition of the inheritance was that he adopt the surname</a> "Freeman-Mitford". He rebuilt <a href="Batsford%20Arboretum">Batsford House</a>, the family's <a href="country%20seat">country seat</a>, served briefly as a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Unionist</a> MP in the 1890s, and otherwise devoted himself to books, writings and travel. In 1902 he was raised to the peerage as 1st Baron Redesdale, a re-creation of a title that had previously been held in the family but had lapsed in 1886.

Nancy Mitford's father, <a href="David%20Freeman-Mitford%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Redesdale">David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford</a>, was Bertie Mitford's second son, born on 13 March 1878. After several years as a tea planter in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> he fought in the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Boer%20War">Boer War</a> of 1899–1902 and was severely wounded. In 1903 he became engaged to Sydney Bowles, the elder daughter of <a href="Thomas%20Gibson%20Bowles">Thomas Gibson Bowles</a>, known as "Tap", a journalist, editor and magazine proprietor whose publications included "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28British%20magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lady%20%28magazine%29">The Lady</a>". The couple were married on 16 February 1904, after which they rented a house in Graham Street in West London. Bowles provided his son-in-law with a job, as business manager of "The Lady" magazine. David had little interest in reading and knew nothing of business; thus, according to Nancy Mitford's biographer Selena Hastings, "a less congenial post ... could hardly have been imagined". He remained in this position for ten years. The couple's first child, a daughter, was born on 28 November 1904; they had intended to call her Ruby, but after she was born they changed their minds and named her Nancy.

Responsibility for Nancy's day-to-day upbringing was delegated to her nanny and nursemaid, within the framework of Sydney's short-lived belief that children should never be corrected or be spoken to in anger. Before this experiment was discontinued, Nancy had become self-centred and uncontrollable; Hastings writes that her first years were "characterised by roaring, red-faced rages". Just before her third birthday, a sister, <a href="Pamela%20Mitford">Pamela</a>, was born; the nanny's apparent change of loyalty in favour of the new arrival was a further source of outrage to Nancy, and throughout their childhood and into young adulthood she continued to vent her displeasure on her sister.

In January 1909 a brother, <a href="Tom%20Mitford">Tom</a> was born, and in June 1910 another sister, <a href="Diana%20Mitford">Diana</a>, followed. That summer, to relieve the pressure on what was becoming an overcrowded nursery, Nancy attended the nearby <a href="Francis%20Holland%20School">Francis Holland School</a>. The few months she spent there represented almost the whole of her formal schooling; in the autumn the family moved to a larger house in <a href="Victoria%20Road%2C%20Kensington">Victoria Road</a>, <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, after which Nancy was educated at home by successive <a href="governess">governess</a>es. Summers were spent at the family's cottage near <a href="High%20Wycombe">High Wycombe</a>, in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, or with the children's Redesdale grandparents at Batsford Park. In the winter of 1913–14 David and Sydney visited Canada, prospecting for gold on a claim that David had purchased in <a href="Swastika%2C%20Ontario">Swastika, Ontario</a>. It was here that their fifth child was conceived, a daughter born in London on 8 August 1914 and christened <a href="Unity%20Mitford">Unity</a>.

On the outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914, David rejoined his regiment and was soon in France. In May 1915, Clement, David's older brother, was killed while serving with the <a href="10th%20Royal%20Hussars">10th Royal Hussars</a>, which made David heir to the Redesdale title and lands. On 17 August 1916 Bertie Mitford died; David, still serving at the front, became the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Sydney quickly took possession of Batsford House, much of which had been shut up for many years, and occupied the portion of it that she could afford to heat. The children had the run of the house and grounds, and were taught together in the schoolroom. This was a source of frustration for Nancy, whose lively intelligence required greater stimulus. She spent many hours reading in the Batsford House library where, according to Hastings, the foundations of her intellectual life were laid.
The Redesdale estates were extensive, but uneconomical. At the end of the war Redesdale decided to sell Batsford Park and move his increasing family (a fifth daughter, <a href="Jessica%20Mitford">Jessica</a>, had been born in September 1917) to less extravagant accommodation. The house was sold early in 1919, together with many of its contents—including, to Nancy's great dismay, much of its library. The new family home was Asthall Manor, a <a href="Jacobean%20architecture">Jacobean</a> mansion near <a href="Swinbrook">Swinbrook</a> in Oxfordshire. This was intended as a short-term measure while a new house was built on land nearby. The family stayed in Asthall Manor for seven years, and it became the basis of many of the family scenes which Nancy was later to portray in her semi-autobiographical novels.

Growing up proved a difficult process for Nancy. Unable to form a relationship with Pamela, the sister nearest to her in age, she was bored and irritated by her younger siblings, and vented her feelings by teasing and tormenting them. Although there was undoubtedly cruelty in her taunting—the other children, led by Tom, formed a "Leag (sic) against Nancy"—her teasing was also, according to the later reflections of her nephew <a href="Alexander%20Mosley">Alexander Mosley</a>: "a highly-honed weapon to keep a lot of highly competitive, bright, energetic sisters in order. She used it ... as a form of self protection". Not all her interactions with her siblings were hostile; for their amusement she edited and produced a magazine, "The Boiler", to which she contributed entertainingly gruesome murder stories.

In 1921, after years of pleading for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much a school, "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a <a href="Girl%20Guide">Girl Guide</a> troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: "I had no idea I was so fond of pictures ... if only I had a room of my own I would make it a regular picture gallery".

Nancy's eighteenth birthday in November 1922 was the occasion for a grand "<a href="Debutante">coming-out</a>" ball, marking the beginning of her entry into <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">Society</a>. This was followed in June 1923 by her presentation at Court—a formal introduction to <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>—after which she was officially "out" and could attend the balls and parties that constituted the <a href="Season%20%28society%29%23The%20Season%20in%20London">London Season</a>. She spent much of the next few years in a round of social events, making new friends and mixing with the "<a href="Bright%20young%20things">Bright Young People</a>" of 1920s London. Nancy declared that "we hardly saw the light of day, except at dawn". In 1926 Asthall Manor was finally sold. While the new house at Swinbrook was made ready, the female members of the family were sent for three months to Paris, a period which, says Hastings, began Nancy's "lifelong love affair" with France.

Among Nancy's new London friends was Evelyn Gardner who, Nancy informed her brother Tom, was engaged "to a man called Evelyn Waugh who writes, I believe, very well". She and <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Waugh</a> later developed a lasting friendship. Although she was now of age, her father maintained an aggressive hostility towards most of her male friends, particularly since, as Hastings remarks, these tended towards the frivolous, the aesthetic and the effeminate. Among them was <a href="James%20Alexander%20Wedderburn%20St.%20Clair-Erskine">Hamish St Clair Erskine</a>, the second son of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Rosslyn">5th Earl of Rosslyn</a>, an Oxford undergraduate four years Nancy's junior. He was, according to Hastings, the least suitable partner of all, "the most shimmering and narcissistic of all the beautiful butterflies"—and the one most likely to offend Lord Redesdale. The pair met in 1928 and became unofficially engaged, despite his homosexuality (of which Nancy may not have been aware). Against a backdrop of negativity from family and friends—Waugh advised her to "dress better and catch a better man"— the affair endured sporadically for several years.

As a means of augmenting the meagre allowance provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 "The Lady" engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, "Highland Fling", in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when it was published in March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, "Christmas Pudding", illustrated by her close friend <a href="Mark%20Ogilvie-Grant">Mark Ogilvie-Grant</a>. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the "Bright Young People" and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of "Bobby Bobbin", and <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it could not possibly be published under Mitford's own name.

The affair between Erskine and Mitford continued intermittently. While she often despaired of the relationship, she refused other offers of marriage, saying that she would "never marry anyone except Hamish." In 1932 her plight was overshadowed by a family scandal involving her younger sister Diana, who had married Bryan Guinness in 1928 and was the mother of two young sons. In 1932 Diana deserted her husband to become the mistress of <a href="Sir%20Oswald%20Mosley">Sir Oswald Mosley</a>, the leader of the <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>, himself married with three children. Almost alone of her family, Mitford offered her sister support, regularly visiting her and keeping her up to date with family news and social gossip. Her own love affair with Erskine came to an abrupt end when, in June 1933, he informed her that he intended to marry the daughter of a London banker. In a final letter after their parting, Mitford wrote to him: "I thought in your soul you loved me & that in the end we should have children & look back on life together when we are old".

Within a month of Erskine's departure, Mitford announced her engagement to <a href="Peter%20Rodd">Peter Rodd</a>, the second son of <a href="Rennell%20Rodd%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rennell">Sir Rennell Rodd</a>, a diplomat and politician who was ennobled that year as Baron Rennell. According to Mitford's friend <a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a>, Rodd was "a young man of boundless promise ... he had abundant qualifications for success in any profession he deigned to choose". Other biographers describe him as irresponsible, unfaithful, a bore and unable to hold down a regular job, and as the model for Waugh's unscrupulous, amoral character Basil Seal from "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>". They were married on 4 December 1933, after which they settled into a cottage at <a href="Strand-on-the-Green">Strand-on-the-Green</a> on the western edges of London. Mitford's initial delight in the marriage was soon tempered by money worries, Rodd's fecklessness and her dislike of his family.

In 1934 Mitford began her third novel, "<a href="Wigs%20on%20the%20Green">Wigs on the Green</a>", a satire on Mosley's fascist "Blackshirt" movement. Mitford herself had briefly flirted with this cause, although her enthusiasm was short-lived and she soon became a vociferous opponent of fascism. When the novel was published in 1935 it made little critical impact, while seriously offending members of her own family, particularly her sisters Diana and Unity, both of whom were supporters of Mosley's movement and devotees of the German dictator <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Diana eventually forgave her, but the rift with Unity, who was outraged by her depiction in the book as the ridiculous "Eugenia Malmains", was never fully healed.

By 1936 Mitford's marriage was largely a sham. Rodd was engaged in an affair with the wife of a friend, a situation that continued into the new year, when the Mitford family was further shaken by the 19-year-old Jessica's elopement with her cousin <a href="Esmond%20Romilly">Esmond Romilly</a>. A rebellious ex-<a href="Wellington%20College%2C%20Berkshire">Wellington</a> schoolboy and avowed Communist, Romilly had been invalided home after fighting on the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republican</a> side in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The young couple were traced to <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>; Mitford was despatched to bring them home, but failed to persuade them, and they were married in May.

Through the winter of 1937–38 Mitford's main literary task was editing the letters of her cousins the <a href="Baron%20Stanley%20of%20Alderley">Stanleys of Alderley</a>, with whom she was connected through her great-grandmother Blanche Airlie. Her preoccupation with this project – nine or ten hours a day, she informed her friend <a href="Robert%20Byron">Robert Byron</a> – further damaged her relationship with Rodd, who resented the time thus spent. Nevertheless, in the summer of 1938 she discovered she was pregnant. She hoped for a girl: "2 Peter Rodds in 1 house is unthinkable", but in September she miscarried. Early in 1939 Rodd left for the South of France, to work with the relief organisations assisting the thousands of Spanish refugees who had fled from <a href="General%20Franco">General Franco</a>'s armies in the final stages of the civil war. In May Mitford joined him, and spent several weeks there as a relief worker. She was much affected by what she saw: "I have never cried so much in all my life". The experience hardened her anti-fascism to the extent that she wrote: "I would join hands with the devil himself to stop any further extension of the disease".

Having rejected the political extremes within her family, Mitford affected a stance of moderate socialism, though as Hastings points out, without much depth or conviction. Many of her writings—for example, her introductions to the Stanley letter collections, and her "U–non-U" essay of 1955—are staunch defences of aristocratic traditions and values.

The outbreak of war in September 1939 divided the Mitford family. Nancy and Rodd supported the war; the Romillys had by this time departed for America, while the others either hoped for an Anglo-German détente or, as with Unity, were openly pro-Nazi. Unity was in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> when war was declared; in despair she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the head. She survived, and was sent home through neutral Switzerland. Mosley and Diana, who had married secretly in 1936, were detained under <a href="Defence%20Regulation%2018B">Defence Regulation 18B</a>. Nancy, in full anti-fascist mode, had described her sister to the British Intelligence agency <a href="MI5">MI5</a> as "a ruthless and shrewd egotist, a devoted fascist and admirer of Hitler [who] sincerely desires the downfall of England and democracy in general." During the "<a href="phoney%20war">phoney war</a>" of 1939–40, Nancy was briefly an <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">Air Raid Precautions</a> (ARP) driver, and later worked shifts at a first-aid post in <a href="Paddington">Paddington</a>. She drew on these experiences in her fourth novel, "Pigeon Pie", a comedy about spying. It was published by Hamish Hamilton in May 1940, at a time when there was little public appetite for lighthearted war satire, and the book was a commercial failure.
In April 1940 Mitford suffered her second miscarriage. Shortly afterwards Rodd, who had been commissioned into the <a href="Welsh%20Guards">Welsh Guards</a>, departed overseas.<ref>

Macintosh Classic

The Macintosh Classic is a <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> designed, manufactured and sold by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer, Inc.</a> from October 1990 to September 1992. It was the first <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> to sell for less than US$1,000.

Production of the Classic was prompted by the success of the <a href="Macintosh%20Plus">Macintosh Plus</a> and the <a href="Macintosh%20SE">Macintosh SE</a>. The system specifications of the Classic are very similar to its predecessors, with the same <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a> display, 512×342 <a href="pixel">pixel</a> resolution, and 4 <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a> (MB) <a href="Random%20access%20memory">memory</a> limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a <a href="68010">68010</a> CPU, higher RAM capacity or color display resulted in criticism from reviewers, with "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>" describing it as having "nothing to gloat about beyond its low price" and "unexceptional". But, it ensured compatibility with the Mac's by-then healthy software base as well as enabled it to fit the lower price Apple intended for it. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25 percent faster than the Plus and included an <a href="SuperDrive">Apple SuperDrive</a> <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">floppy disk drive</a> as standard.

The Classic is an adaptation of <a href="Jerry%20Manock">Jerry Manock</a>'s and Terry Oyama's 1984 <a href="Macintosh%20128K">Macintosh 128K</a> industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged in price from $1,000 to $1,500. The price and the availability of education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful <a href="Macintosh%20Classic%20II">Macintosh Classic II</a> in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.

After Apple co-founder <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> left Apple in 1985, product development was handed to <a href="Jean-Louis%20Gass%C3%A9e">Jean-Louis Gassée</a>, formerly the manager of Apple France. Gassée consistently pushed the Apple product line in two directions, towards more "openness" in terms of expandability and interoperability, and towards higher price. Gassée long argued that Apple should not market their computers towards the low end of the market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the <a href="price/performance%20ratio">price/performance ratio</a> of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right. The "high-right" goal became a mantra among the upper management, who said "fifty-five or die", referring to Gassée's goal of a 55 percent profit margin.

The high-right policy led to a series of machines with ever-increasing prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1,000, but by the time it had morphed from <a href="Jef%20Raskin">Jef Raskin</a>'s original vision of an easy-to-use machine for composing text documents to Jobs' concept incorporating ideas gleaned during a trip to <a href="Xerox%20PARC">Xerox PARC</a>, the Mac's list price had ballooned to $2,495. From there, the price of Mac systems continued to climb: the <a href="Macintosh%20Plus">Macintosh Plus</a> was slightly more expensive at $2,599, the SE was $2,900 or $3,900 depending on the model, and a basic <a href="Macintosh%20II">Macintosh II</a> with a 40 MB hard drive was at least $5,500 (at launch, with the price increasing in late 1988). More modern machines cost even more: the <a href="Macintosh%20IIcx">Macintosh IIcx</a> was $5,369, the <a href="Macintosh%20IIci">IIci</a> $6,269, and the <a href="Macintosh%20IIfx">IIfx</a> $9,900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14-inch 640×480 monitor had a list price of $999 and Apple's <a href="Apple%20Desktop%20Bus">ADB</a> keyboards, while of high quality, were similarly expensive. The only inexpensive machine in the lineup by the late 1980s was the several-year-old Mac Plus, which was now selling for around $1,800.

With the "low-left" of the market it had abandoned years earlier booming with <a href="White%20box%20%28computer%20hardware%29">Turbo XT</a>s, and being ignored on the high end for <a href="UNIX%20workstation">UNIX workstation</a>s from the likes of <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and <a href="Silicon%20Graphics%20Incorporated">SGI</a>, Apple's fortunes of the 1980s quickly reversed. The Christmas season of 1989 drove this point home, with the first decrease in sales in years, and an accompanying 20 percent drop in Apple's stock price for the quarter.

In January 1990, Gassée resigned and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers had long been pressing for lower-cost options in order to build market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, <a href="Macintosh%20LC">Macintosh LC</a>, and <a href="Macintosh%20IIsi">Macintosh IIsi</a>. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original <a href="Macintosh%20startup%20sound">Macintosh startup sound</a>.

"<a href="MacWEEK">MacWEEK</a>" magazine reported on July 10, 1990, that Apple had paid $1 million to Modular Computer Systems Inc., a subsidiary of <a href="Daimler-Benz%20AG">Daimler-Benz AG</a>, for the right to use the "Classic" name as part of a five-year contract. Apple did not renew the contract when it ended. "MacWEEK" speculated the Macintosh Classic would use the same 8 <a href="Hertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a> and display as its predecessors and that the Classic would be priced from $1,500 to $2,150.

On December 12, 1990, <a href="John%20Sculley">John Sculley</a> (then Apple <a href="CEO">CEO</a>) introduced the Classic at a press conference, announcing that pricing would start at $1,000 and saying, "To reach new customers, we didn't just lower the prices of our existing products. We redesigned these computers from the ground up with the features customers have told us they value most." Apple's new pricing strategy caused concern among investors, who thought it would reduce <a href="profit%20margin">profit margin</a>s. Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing manager, said, "We are prepared to do whatever it takes to reach more people with Macintosh ... The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to be." After the release of the Classic, Apple's <a href="share%20price">share price</a> closed at $27.75 per share, down 50 cents from October 12, 1990, and far below its previous 12-month high of $50.37.

The Classic was released in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a> concurrently with the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> release. In Japan, the Classic retailed for 198,000 <a href="Japanese%20yen">yen</a> ($1,523), more than in the US but matching the price of the <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba Dynabook</a> laptop computer.

After spending $40 million marketing the Classic to first-time buyers, Apple had difficulty meeting the high demand. Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork, Ireland</a> factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, was used to speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among dealers, who blamed Apple's poor business planning.

Macintosh Classics and <a href="Macintosh%20LC">LCs</a> had been given to <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic Software</a> 12 weeks before they were officially announced, and Scholastic planned to release 16 new Macintosh products in 1991. Peter Kelman, Scholastic's publisher, predicted that the Macintosh would become "the school machine of the nineties." The Classic was sold to schools for $800. This, and the availability of educational software, led to the Classic's popularity in the education sector.

The low-end model was sold with 1 MB memory, a 1.44 MB floppy drive, no <a href="hard%20disk">hard disk</a>, and included a keyboard for $999. The high-end model cost $1,499 but contained an additional 1 MB memory expansion card and a 40 MB hard disk.

The Classic features several improvements over the <a href="Macintosh%20Plus">Macintosh Plus</a>, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer: it is up to 25 percent faster than the Plus, about as fast as the SE, and includes an <a href="SuperDrive">Apple SuperDrive</a> 3.5" <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">floppy disk drive</a> as standard. The SuperDrive can read and write to Macintosh, <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, <a href="OS/2">OS/2</a>, and <a href="ProDOS">ProDOS</a> disks. Also, the Classic is the last compact Mac to use the Motorola 68000 central processing unit (CPU).

The Classic uses the <a href="System%206">System 6</a>.0.7 <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> with support for all versions up to <a href="System%207">System 7</a>.5.5. A hidden <a href="Hierarchical%20File%20System">Hierarchical File System</a> (HFS) disk volume contained in the <a href="read-only%20memory">read-only memory</a> (ROM) includes System 6.0.3. The Mac Classic can be booted into System 6.0.3 by holding down the keys during boot.

Some dealers included a software bundle called Smartbundle with the Classic. Also sold separately for $349, this includes <a href="T/Maker">T/Maker</a>'s <a href="WriteNow">WriteNow</a> word processor, <a href="Ashton-Tate">Ashton-Tate</a>'s <a href="Full%20Impact">Full Impact</a> spreadsheet program, RecordHolderPlus database, and <a href="Silicon%20Beach%20Software">Silicon Beach Software</a>'s <a href="SuperPaint%20%28Macintosh%29">SuperPaint</a> 2.0 paint and draw program.

The Macintosh Classic is the final adaptation of <a href="Jerry%20Manock">Jerry Manock</a>'s and Terry Oyama's <a href="Macintosh%20128K">Macintosh 128K</a> industrial design, bringing back some elements of the original, while retaining little of the <a href="Snow%20White%20design%20language">Snow White design language</a> used in the <a href="Macintosh%20SE">Macintosh SE</a>'s design. The only remnant of the SE is the stripe across the front panel (bezel) for the floppy drive; the distinctive front bezel lines of the SE were not used on the Classic, and the vertical lines around its base are replaced by four horizontal vent lines, more reminiscent of the original design. Also, the curve of the front bezel was increased to the same radial curve as on the front of both the <a href="Macintosh%20LC">Macintosh LC</a> and <a href="Macintosh%20IIsi">Macintosh IIsi</a>. The screen brightness dial on this bezel was also removed in favor of a software control. This broad, curved front bezel became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s.

The <a href="Motherboard">logic board</a>, the central circuit board of the computer, is based on the Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using <a href="Surface-mount%20technology">surface mount technology</a> to 9×5 inches (23×13 cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a>, led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the <a href="Macintosh%20Classic%20II">Classic II</a>, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the <a href="Macintosh%20SE/30">Macintosh SE/30</a>.

Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic focused on the processor performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of "Home Office Computing" praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the display because a full US letter page ( × 11 inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get you working on that novel, database, or spreadsheet." "<a href="eWeek">PC Week</a>" criticized the lack of a faster processor, stating, "The 7.8 MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." Similarly, "<a href="PC%20User">PC User</a>"'s review concluded, "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". "MacWEEK" described it as a "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision six and a half years later". "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.

In the February 1991 edition of "Electronic Learning", Robert McCarthy wrote: "Teachers, educational administrators and software developers are enthusiastic about the new, lower cost Apple Macintosh computers". Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at <a href="MECC">MECC</a>, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: "[it] is terrific – both because it's a Mac and because of that low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh." Scholastic, an educational software developer, was also confident of Apple's ability to compete with <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> machines, stating: "They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort-level." Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: "we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue." Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic because of the lack of a color monitor, an option which the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular <a href="Apple%20IIe%20Card">Apple IIe Card</a> also increased the LC's appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million).

Paul Kruger

Stephanus Johannes Paulus "Paul" Kruger (; 10 October 1825 – 14 July 1904) was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="President%20of%20the%20South%20African%20Republic">President</a> of the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a> (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed "Oom Paul" ("Uncle Paul"), he came to international prominence as the face of the <a href="Boer">Boer</a> cause—that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>—against Britain during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> of 1899–1902. He has been called a personification of <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>dom, and remains a controversial and divisive figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero, and critics view him as the obstinate guardian of an unjust cause.

Born near the eastern edge of the <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a>, Kruger took part in the <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no education apart from the Bible, and through his interpretation believed the <a href="Flat%20Earth">Earth was flat</a>. A protégé of the <a href="Voortrekker">Voortrekker</a> leader <a href="Andries%20Pretorius">Andries Pretorius</a>, he witnessed the signing of the <a href="Sand%20River%20Convention">Sand River Convention</a> with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its <a href="Boer%20Commando">commandos</a> and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected <a href="Commandant-General">Commandant-General</a>, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President <a href="Thomas%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Burgers">Thomas François Burgers</a>.

Kruger was appointed <a href="Vice%20State%20President%20of%20the%20South%20African%20Republic">Vice-President</a> in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned. He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">First Boer War</a> of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive <a href="triumvirate">triumvirate</a>, then was <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201883">elected</a> President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the <a href="London%20Convention%20%281884%29">London Convention</a>, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.

Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the <a href="Witwatersrand%20Gold%20Rush">Witwatersrand Gold Rush</a> of 1886, "<a href="uitlander">uitlander</a>s" (out-landers) provided almost all of the South African Republic's tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer <a href="Burgher%20%28Boer%20republics%29">burghers</a> retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger's attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201888">1888</a>, <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201893">1893</a> and <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201898">1898</a>, and led to the <a href="Jameson%20Raid">Jameson Raid</a> of 1895–96 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the <a href="Heroes%27%20Acre%20%28South%20Africa%29">Heroes' Acre</a> in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>.

Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the <a href="Steynsburg">Steynsburg</a> area of the <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a>, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801-1852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; "née" Steyn; 1806-1834). The family was of Dutch-speaking <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> or <a href="Boer">Boer</a> background, of German, French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> and Dutch stock. His paternal ancestors had been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Krüger, from <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, arrived in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> as a 17-year-old soldier in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>'s service. Jacob's children dropped the <a href="Germanic%20umlaut">umlaut</a> from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin. Over the following generations, Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior. His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards. Kruger's great-great-uncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of <a href="Swellendam">Swellendam</a> that revolted against Company rule in 1795.

Bulhoek, Kruger's birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie's home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in <a href="Cradock%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Cradock</a> in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14. A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul was born in 1825. His first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used. The provenance of the third given name, Paulus, "was to remain rather a mystery", <a href="Johannes%20Meintjes">Johannes Meintjes</a> wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, "and yet the boy was always called Paul."

Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826. Soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near <a href="Colesberg">Colesberg</a>, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother died when he was eight; his father Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje ("née" du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, the only education Kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.

In 1835 Casper Kruger, his father, and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the <a href="Caledon%20River">Caledon River</a>, on the Cape Colony's far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814, when the Netherlands ceded it to Britain with the <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Treaty%20of%201814">Convention of London</a>. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a>—a mass migration by Dutch-speaking "<a href="Voortrekkers">Voortrekkers</a>" north-east from the Cape to the land on the far side of the <a href="Orange%20River">Orange</a> and <a href="Vaal%20River">Vaal</a> rivers. Many Boers had been expressing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content. They had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape.

A group of emigrants under <a href="Hendrik%20Potgieter">Hendrik Potgieter</a> passed through the Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a <a href="Boer%20republic">Boer republic</a> with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey, the trekkers made improvised classrooms, marking them with reeds and grass. The more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.
The Voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for the area they were entering from <a href="Mzilikazi">Mzilikazi</a> and his <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Ndebele</a> (or Matabele) people, a branch from the <a href="Zulu%20Kingdom">Zulu Kingdom</a> to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vegkop">Battle of Vegkop</a>, where Potgieter's <a href="laager">laager</a>, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as <a href="cast%20bullet">bullet-casting</a>, while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.

During 1837 and 1838 Kruger's family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary <a href="Daniel%20Lindley">Daniel Lindley</a>, who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration. The Zulu King <a href="Dingane%20kaSenzangakhona">Dingane</a> concluded a land treaty with Potgieter. But he reconsidered and massacred first <a href="Piet%20Retief">Piet Retief</a>'s party of settlers, then <a href="Weenen%20massacre">others at Weenen</a>. Kruger later recounted his family's group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing "children pinioned to their mothers' breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels". But "God heard our prayer", he recalled, and "we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack ... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game."

Because of the attacks, the Krugers returned to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that forced Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the <a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo River</a>, to what became <a href="Matabeleland">Matabeleland</a>. Kruger and his father settled at the foot of the <a href="Magaliesberg">Magaliesberg</a> mountains in the Transvaal. In Natal <a href="Andries%20Pretorius">Andries Pretorius</a> defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blood%20River">Battle of Blood River</a> on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as "Dingaansdag" ("Dingane's Day") or the <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Vow">Day of the Vow</a>.

Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two farms—one for crops and one for grazing—upon becoming enfranchised <a href="Burgher%20%28Boer%20republics%29">burghers</a> at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at <a href="Waterkloof">Waterkloof</a>, near <a href="Rustenburg">Rustenburg</a> in the Magaliesberg area. This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in <a href="Potchefstroom">Potchefstroom</a> in 1842. The same year Kruger was elected a deputy <a href="field%20cornet">field cornet</a>—"a singular honour at seventeen", Meintjes comments. This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned officer</a>.

Kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman, horseman and <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> fighter. In addition to his native Dutch, he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion for the first time when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions, Kruger was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the <a href="Steelpoort%20River">Steelpoort River</a>, his four-pounder <a href="elephant%20gun">elephant gun</a> exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a>. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When <a href="Gangrene">gangrenous</a> marks appeared on his arm up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less." The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again.
Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' short-lived <a href="Natalia%20Republic">Natalia Republic</a> in 1843 as the <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Colony of Natal</a>. Pretorius briefly led Boer resistance to this, but before long most of the Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to the area around the Orange and Vaal rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to <a href="Maputo%20Bay">Delagoa Bay</a> in <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Mozambique</a> to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the <a href="Lebombo%20Mountains">Lebombo Mountains</a> were settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846. In 1847 Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.

Concerned by the exodus of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that the Boers remained <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a>s, the British Governor <a href="Sir%20Harry%20Smith%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Harry Smith</a> in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the "<a href="Orange%20River%20Sovereignty">Orange River Sovereignty</a>". Pretorius led a <a href="Boer%20commando">Boer commando</a> raid against this, and they were defeated by Smith at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Boomplaats">Battle of Boomplaats</a>. Like the Krugers, Pretorius lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man's resolve, sophistication and piety. A warm relationship developed. "Kruger's political awareness can be dated from 1850", Meintjes writes, "and it was in no small measure given to him by Pretorius." Like Pretorius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a single authority and win British recognition for their territory as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain—neither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British—but because they perceived the emigrants' unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects.

<a href="Henry%20Douglas%20Warden">Henry Douglas Warden</a>, the British <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">Resident</a> in the Orange River area, advised Smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with Pretorius. Smith sent representatives to meet him at the <a href="Sand%20River%20%28Free%20State%29">Sand River</a>. Kruger, aged 26, accompanied Pretorius and on 17 January 1852 was present at the conclusion of the <a href="Sand%20River%20Convention">Sand River Convention</a>, under which Britain recognised "the Emigrant Farmers" in the Transvaal as independent: they called themselves the "<a href="South%20African%20Republic">Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek</a>" ("South African Republic"). In exchange for the Boers' pledge not to introduce slavery in the Transvaal, the British agreed not to make an alliance with any "coloured nations" there. Kruger's uncle Gert was also present; his father Casper would have been as well but he was ill and unable to attend.

The Boers and the local <a href="Tswana%20people">Tswana</a> and <a href="Sotho%20people">Basotho</a> chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852, and in August that year he took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dimawe">Battle of Dimawe</a>, a raid against the Tswana chief <a href="Sechele%20I">Sechele I</a>. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a> (edema). Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but knocked him out without cutting him; later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket but not wounding him. The commando wrecked <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a>'s mission station at <a href="Kolobeng%20Mission">Kolobeng</a>, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.

Livingstone and many others criticised the Boers for abducting women and children from tribal settlements and taking them home to work as slaves. The Boers argued that they did not keep these captives as slaves but as "<a href="Inboekstelsel">inboekelings</a>"—<a href="indentured%20servant">indentured</a> "apprentices" who, having lost their families, were given bed, board and training in a Boer household until reaching adulthood. Modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a technical ruse by the Boers to enforce a means of inexpensive labour for them while avoiding overt slavery. Gezina Kruger had an "inboekeling" maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage, and paid her a <a href="dowry">dowry</a>.

Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant (between field cornet and <a href="commandant">commandant</a>), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command. Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late. Meintjes says that Pretorius "was perhaps the first person to recognise that behind [Kruger's] rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all the more remarkable for being almost entirely self-developed".

Pretorius did not name a successor as <a href="Commandant-General">Commandant-General</a>; his eldest son <a href="Marthinus%20Wessel%20Pretorius">Marthinus Wessel Pretorius</a> was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger to the rank of commandant. Pretorius the son claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area—he said the British had promised it to his father—but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following <a href="George%20Cathcart">Sir George Cathcart</a>'s replacement of Smith as governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to the extent that the British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the fact that in addition to the Boer settlers there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 <a href="George%20Russell%20Clerk">Sir George Russell Clerk</a> signed the <a href="Orange%20River%20Convention">Orange River Convention</a>, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the "<a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Oranje-Vrijstaat</a>" ("Orange Free State").

<a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>, the former British garrison town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal seat of government became <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the <a href="Zoutpansberg">Zoutpansberg</a>, <a href="Lydenburg">Lydenburg</a> and <a href="Utrecht%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal">Utrecht</a> districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was in the latter part of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the <a href="Waterberg%20Biosphere">Waterberg</a>. The chiefs retreated into what became called the <a href="Makapansgat">Caves of Makapan</a> ("Makapansgat") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.

Marthinus Pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but <a href="Stephanus%20Schoeman">Stephanus Schoeman</a>, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.

The constitution settled upon formalised a national <a href="volksraad">volksraad</a> (parliament) and created an executive council, headed by a president. Pretorius was sworn in as the first president of the South African Republic on 6 January 1857. Kruger successfully proposed Schoeman for the post of national Commandant-General, hoping to thereby end the factional disputes and foster unity, but Schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or Pretorius. With the Transvaal on the verge of civil war, tensions also rose with the Orange Free State after Pretorius's ambitions of absorbing it became widely known. Kruger had strong personal reservations about Pretorius, not considering him his father's equal, but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him.

After the Free State government dismissed an ultimatum from Pretorius to cease what he regarded as the marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President <a href="Jacobus%20Nicolaas%20Boshoff">Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff</a> of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms.

With Pretorius's approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>. Kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of Pretorius's actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his president when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857. Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and <a href="Moshoeshoe%20I">Moshoeshoe I</a> of the Basotho, and persuaded Schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as commandant-general. On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic. "All in all", Kruger's biographer T R H Davenport comments, "he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play."

Kruger considered <a href="Divine%20providence">Providence</a> his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the <a href="Flat%20Earth">Earth was flat</a>, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said <a href="Grace%20%28prayer%29">grace</a> twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>. In late 1858, when he returned to Waterkloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions of the past few years and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him "nearly dead from hunger and thirst", Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child.

Kruger belonged to the "Doppers"—a group of about 6,000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional Calvinist doctrine. They based their theology almost entirely on the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>. When the 1859 <a href="synod">synod</a> of the "<a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church%20in%20South%20Africa%20%28NHK%29">Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika</a>" (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as "deluded" and "false" and left its Rustenburg congregation. They formed the "<a href="Reformed%20Churches%20in%20South%20Africa">Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika</a>" (GK), thereafter known informally as the "Dopper Church", and recruited the Reverend <a href="Dirk%20Postma">Dirk Postma</a>, a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister. This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs.

In late 1859 Pretorius was invited to stand for president in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing <a href="Johannes%20Hermanus%20Grobler">Johannes Hermanus Grobler</a> to be acting president in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as president of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.
Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. <a href="Willem%20Cornelis%20Janse%20van%20Rensburg">Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg</a> was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.
Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced—Van Rensburg became president, with Kruger as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as commandant-general with a large majority. The <a href="Transvaal%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the <a href="Crocodile%20River%20%28Limpopo%29">Crocodile River</a> on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as commandant-general with over two-thirds of the vote.

The civil war had led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President <a href="Johannes%20Brand">Johannes Brand</a> of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.
In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching <a href="Schoemansdal%2C%20Limpopo">Schoemansdal</a>, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's <a href="Swazi%20people">Swazi</a> allies.

Pretorius stepped down as president in November 1871. In the <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201872">1872 election</a> Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend <a href="Thomas%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Burgers">Thomas François Burgers</a>, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the <a href="Devil%20in%20Christianity">Devil</a>, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that "as a good republican" he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new president. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours—in Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of commandant-general was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to <a href="Boekenhoutfontein">Boekenhoutfontein</a>, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.

Burgers busied himself attempting to modernise the South African Republic along European lines, hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united, independent South Africa. Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in <a href="Griqua%20people">Griqua</a> territory just north of the Orange River on the western edge of the Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as <a href="uitlander">uitlander</a>s ("out-landers"), were flooding into the region. Britain began to pursue <a href="federation">federation</a> (at that time often referred to as "confederation") of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge <a href="Big%20Hole">diamond mine</a> at <a href="Kimberley%2C%20Northern%20Cape">Kimberley</a>, dubbing it <a href="Griqualand%20West">Griqualand West</a>.

Some Doppers preferred to embark on another trek, north-west across the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a> towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the <a href="Dorsland%20Trek">Dorsland Trek</a> of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, but he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.

In 1876 hostilities broke out with the <a href="Pedi%20people">Bapedi</a> people under <a href="Sekhukhune">Sekhukhune</a>. Burgers had told the Acting President <a href="Piet%20Joubert">Piet Joubert</a> not to fight a war in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile commandant-general refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of "volunteers" under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.

With Burgers due to stand for re-election the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 <a href="Henry%20Herbert%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Carnarvon">Lord Carnarvon</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a> under <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, gave <a href="Theophilus%20Shepstone">Sir Theophilus Shepstone</a> of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.

Shepstone arrived in Pretoria in January 1877. He outlined criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and expressed support for federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney <a href="E.%20J.%20P.%20Jorissen">E J P Jorissen</a> refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, one of which was that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of vice-president.

The impression of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him "gigantically horrible", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty <a href="pipe%20smoking">pipe</a> protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to <a href="Martin%20Meredith">Martin Meredith</a>, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports "so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions.
Shepstone had the Transvaal's annexation as a British territory formally announced in Pretoria on 11 April 1877. Burgers resigned and returned to the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as president was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, <a href="Willem%20Eduard%20Bok">Willem Eduard Bok</a>, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and <a href="Worcester%2C%20Western%20Cape">Worcester</a>, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the first time in his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea.

During the voyage to England Kruger encountered a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named <a href="Martinus%20Theunis%20Steyn">Martinus Theunis Steyn</a>. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, in their eyes more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and the structure of the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.

Kruger did not meet <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact. Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877. He found a national awakening occurring. "Paradoxically", John Laband writes, "British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit." When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in <a href="Church%20Square%2C%20Pretoria">Church Square</a>. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British.
According to Meintjes, Kruger was still not particularly anti-British; he thought the British had made a mistake and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British <a href="High%20Commissioner%20for%20Southern%20Africa">High Commissioner</a> in Cape Town, <a href="Henry%20Bartle%20Frere">Sir Bartle Frere</a>, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.

Carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by <a href="Michael%20Hicks%20Beach%2C%201st%20Earl%20St%20Aldwyn">Sir Michael Hicks Beach</a>, who received the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: "Have you ever heard of an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?" Kruger retorted: "Yes. The Orange Free State." The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a> dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end." Kruger was touched and wore it for the rest of his life.

Like its predecessor, the second deputation went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, where the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281878%29">1878 "Exposition Universelle"</a> was in progress, Kruger saw a <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a> for the first time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. "High up in mid-air", he recalled, "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home." The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal "to remind me of my journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.

Kruger and Joubert returned home to find the British and the Zulus were close to war. Shepstone had supported the Zulus in a border dispute with the South African Republic, but then, after annexing the Transvaal, changed his mind and endorsed the Boer claim. Meeting Sir Bartle Frere and <a href="Frederic%20Thesiger%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Chelmsford">Lord Chelmsford</a> at <a href="Pietermaritzburg">Pietermaritzburg</a> on 28 November 1878, Kruger happily gave tactical guidance for the British campaign—he advised the use of Boer tactics, making laagers at every stop and constantly scouting ahead—but refused Frere's request that he accompany one of the British columns, saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding the Transvaal. Chelmsford thought the campaign would be a "promenade" and did not take Kruger's advice. Soon after he entered Zululand in January 1879, starting the <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">Anglo-Zulu War</a>, his unlaagered central column was surprised by <a href="Cetshwayo%20kaMpande">Cetshwayo</a>'s Zulus at <a href="Battle%20of%20Isandlwana">Isandlwana</a> and almost totally destroyed.
The war in Zululand effectively ended on 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulundi">victory</a> at the Zulu capital <a href="Ulundi">Ulundi</a>. Around the same time the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, <a href="Garnet%20Wolseley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolseley">Sir Garnet Wolseley</a>, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.

At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, many of them bearing the republic's "<a href="Flag%20of%20Transvaal">vierkleur</a>" ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, independent republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> when they took this news to Wolseley and <a href="Owen%20Lanyon">Sir Owen Lanyon</a> (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> politician <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">Midlothian campaign</a>.

In early 1880 Hicks Beach forwarded a scheme for South African federation to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape Parliament</a>. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; by the time they arrived the Liberals had won an <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">election victory</a> in Britain and Gladstone was prime minister. In Cape Town, <a href="Paarl">Paarl</a> and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the prime minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner by <a href="George%20Pomeroy%20Colley">Sir George Pomeroy Colley</a>.
In the last months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax payments from burghers who were in arrears. <a href="Piet%20Cronj%C3%A9">Piet Cronjé</a>, a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local <a href="landdrost">landdrost</a> a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their "legal government"—that of the South African Republic—but not to the British "usurper" administration. Kruger and Cronjé knew each other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed. In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher's wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronjé and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon. On hearing of this from Cronjé, Kruger told Joubert: "I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things."

Starting on 8 December 1880 at <a href="Krugersdorp">Paardekraal</a>, a farm to the south-west of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded meeting of white people in South Africa up to that time. "I stand here before you", Kruger declared, "called by the people. In the voice of the people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!" He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the vice-president of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive <a href="triumvirate">triumvirate</a> along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.

At Kruger's suggestion Joubert was elected Commandant-General of the restored republic, though he had little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at <a href="Heidelberg%2C%20Gauteng">Heidelberg</a>, a strategically placed town on the main road from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.

Kruger took part in the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">First Boer War</a> in a civilian capacity only, playing a diplomatic and political role with the aid of Jorissen and Bok. The first major clash, a successful Boer ambush, took place on 20 December 1880 at <a href="Battle%20of%20Bronkhorstspruit">Bronkhorstspruit</a>. By the turn of the year the Transvaalers had all six British garrison outposts, including that in Pretoria, under siege. Colley assembled a <a href="Natal%20Field%20Force">field force</a> in Natal, summoned reinforcements from India, and advanced towards the Transvaal. Joubert moved about 2,000 Boers south to the <a href="Drakensberg">Drakensberg</a> and repulsed Colley at <a href="Battle%20of%20Laing%27s%20Nek">Laing's Nek</a> on 28 January 1881. After Colley retreated to Schuinshoogte, near <a href="Ingogo">Ingogo</a>, he was attacked by Joubert's second-in-command <a href="Nicolaas%20Smit">Nicolaas Smit</a> on 8 February and again <a href="Battle%20of%20Schuinshoogte">defeated</a>.

Understanding that they could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a solution at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary <a href="John%20Wodehouse%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kimberley">Lord Kimberley</a>, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Majuba%20Hill">Battle of Majuba Hill</a> the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.

Colley's death horrified Kruger, who feared it might jeopardise the peace process. His reply to Colley's letter was delivered to his successor <a href="Evelyn%20Wood%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Sir Evelyn Wood</a> on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, <a href="cession">retrocession</a> of the Transvaal under British <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly "suzerainty" meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months. The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881.

Kruger presented the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. "With a feeling of gratitude to the God of our fathers", he said, "who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty ... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to show you a proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice." This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his "most notable utterances". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, <a href="Hercules%20Robinson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rosmead">Sir Hercules Robinson</a> and the Cape's Chief Justice <a href="John%20de%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Villiers">Sir Henry de Villiers</a>, who convened for the first time in Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.

Kruger was largely happy with the terms under which the republic would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him. The first of these was that the British would recognise them as the "Transvaal Republic" and not the South African Republic; the second was that it was still not clear to him what British "suzerainty" was. The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal's external affairs. The final <a href="Pretoria%20Convention">Pretoria Convention</a> was signed on 3 August 1881 by Joubert, Pretorius and the members of the royal commission. Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square. Kruger felt well enough to give only a short speech, after which Pretorius addressed the crowd and the "vierkleur" was raised.
By now aged nearly 56, Kruger resolved that he could no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the <a href="chinstrap%20beard">chinstrap beard</a> he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called <a href="Kruger%20House%2C%20Pretoria">Kruger House</a>, would be completed in 1884.

A direct consequence of the end of British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad—approve it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger—before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial <a href="monopoly">monopolies</a> to raise money and appointed the Reverend <a href="Stephanus%20Jacobus%20du%20Toit">S J du Toit</a> to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new president the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which "God's Word would be my rule of conduct"—as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would "prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and "obedient native races in their appointed districts". He <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201883">defeated</a> Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as president on 9 May 1883.

Kruger became president soon after the discovery of gold near what was to become <a href="Barberton%2C%20Mpumalanga">Barberton</a>, which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers. "This gold is still going to soak our country in blood", said Joubert—a prediction he would repeat many times over the coming years. Joubert remained commandant-general under Kruger and also became vice-president. A convoluted situation developed on the Transvaal's western frontier, where burghers had crossed the border defined in the Pretoria Convention and formed two new Boer republics, <a href="Stellaland">Stellaland</a> and <a href="State%20of%20Goshen">Goshen</a>, on former Tswana territory in 1882. These states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance—the main road from the Cape to Matabeleland and the African interior.

Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with <a href="Ewald%20Auguste%20Esselen">Ewald Esselen</a> as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2015th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a> and Robinson progressed smoothly—apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson—and on 27 February 1884 the <a href="London%20Convention%20%281884%29">London Convention</a>, superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's <a href="national%20debt">national debt</a> and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph.
The deputation went on from London to mainland Europe, where according to Meintjes their reception "was beyond all expectations ... one banquet followed the other, the stand of a handful of Boers against the British Empire having caused a sensation". During a grand tour Kruger met <a href="William%20III%20of%20the%20Netherlands">William III of the Netherlands</a> and his son the <a href="Alexander%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Prince of Orange</a>, <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">Leopold II of Belgium</a>, President <a href="Jules%20Gr%C3%A9vy">Jules Grévy</a> of France, <a href="Alfonso%20XII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XII of Spain</a>, <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20I%20of%20Portugal">Luís I of Portugal</a>, and in Germany Kaiser <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm I</a> and his Chancellor <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>. His public appearances were attended by tens of thousands. The deputation discussed the bilateral aspects of the proposed Delagoa Bay railway with the Portuguese, and in the Netherlands laid the groundwork for the <a href="Netherlands-South%20African%20Railway%20Company">Netherlands-South African Railway Company</a>, which would build and operate it. Kruger now held that Burgers had been "far ahead of his time"—while reviving his predecessor's railway scheme, he also brought back the policy of importing officials from the Netherlands, in his view a means to strengthen the Boer identity and keep the Transvaal "Dutch". <a href="Willem%20Johannes%20Leyds">Willem Johannes Leyds</a>, a 24-year-old Dutchman, returned to South Africa with the deputation as the republic's new State Attorney.

By late 1884 the <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">Scramble for Africa</a> was well underway. Competition on the western frontier rose after Germany annexed <a href="German%20South-West%20Africa">South-West Africa</a>; at the behest of the mining magnate and Cape MP <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, Britain proclaimed a <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">protectorate</a> over Bechuanaland, including the Stellaland–Goshen corridor. While Joubert was in negotiations with Rhodes, Du Toit had Kruger proclaim Transvaal protection over the corridor on 18 September 1884. Joubert was outraged, as was Kruger when on 3 October Du Toit unilaterally hoisted the "vierkleur" in Goshen. Realising the implications of this—it clearly violated the London Convention—Kruger had the flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 September. Meeting Rhodes personally in late January 1885, Kruger insisted the "flag incident" had taken place without his consent and conceded the corridor to the British.

In July 1886 an Australian prospector reported to the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the <a href="Witwatersrand%20Gold%20Rush">Witwatersrand Gold Rush</a> and the founding of <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, which within a few years was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.

The President was by this time widely nicknamed "Oom Paul" ("Uncle Paul"), both among the Boers and the uitlanders, who variously used it out of affection or contempt. He was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised the independence of the republic's judiciary to help his friend <a href="Alois%20Hugo%20Nellmapius">Alois Hugo Nellmapius</a>, who had been found guilty of <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>—Kruger rejected the court's judgement and granted Nellmapius a full <a href="pardon">pardon</a>, an act Nathan calls "completely indefensible". Kruger defeated Joubert again in the <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201888">1888 election</a>, by 4,483 votes to 834, and was sworn in for a second time in May. Nicolaas Smit was elected vice-president, and Leyds was promoted to state secretary.
Much of Kruger's efforts over the next year were dedicated to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King <a href="Lobengula">Lobengula</a> of Matabeleland, was killed by <a href="Mangwato%20tribe">Ngwato</a> warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of "Cecil Rhodes and his clique". Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral—in his memoirs he called him "capital incarnate" and "the curse of South Africa". According to the editor of Kruger's memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting "we simply take" Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled. Failing to make headway in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to <a href="Kosi%20Bay">Kosi Bay</a>, next to Swaziland, in late 1888.

In early 1889 Kruger and the new Orange Free State President <a href="Francis%20William%20Reitz">Francis William Reitz</a> enacted a common-defence pact and a customs treaty waiving most import duties. The same year the volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove the "Nederduits Hervormde Kerk"'s official status, open the legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches "sovereign in their own spheres". Kruger proposed to end the lack of higher education in the Boer republics by forming a university in Pretoria; enthusiastic support emerged for this but the <a href="VU%20University%20Amsterdam">Free University of Amsterdam</a> expressed strong opposition, not wishing to lose the Afrikaner element of its student body. No university was built.

Kruger was obsessed with the South African Republic's independence, the retention of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided almost all of the republic's revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official. Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals' industry and respect for the state's laws, but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the probable result of absorption into the British sphere. Agonising over how he "could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers", he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a "second volksraad" in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them. Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger's own supporters were unenthusiastic.

Rhodes and other British figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger's administration recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician <a href="James%20Bryce%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bryce">James Bryce</a>, most uitlanders saw the country as "virtually English" and perceived "something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors". On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the "vierkleur" at the city landdrost's office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying. One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: "I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself." The riot was broken up by police and the <a href="South%20African%20Chamber%20of%20Mines">Chamber of Mines</a> issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying only a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as "the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began".

In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor <a href="Henry%20Loch%2C%201st%20Baron%20Loch">Sir Henry Brougham Loch</a>, Loch's legal adviser <a href="William%20Philip%20Schreiner">William Philip Schreiner</a>, and Rhodes, who had by now attained a dominant position in the Transvaal's mining industry and a <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> for his <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a> to <a href="Company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">occupy and administer</a> Matabeleland and <a href="Mashonaland">Mashonaland</a>. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.

Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A month later the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without consulting the Swazis)—the South African Republic could build a railway through it to Kosi Bay on the condition that the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's <a href="Chartered%20Company">Chartered Company</a> in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and <a href="price%20gouging">price gouging</a>.

Kruger's second volksraad sat for the first time in 1891. Any resolution it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were <a href="naturalization">naturalised</a> as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201893">1893 election</a>, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice <a href="John%20Gilbert%20Kotz%C3%A9">John Gilbert Kotzé</a> as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.
Kruger was by this time widely perceived as a personification of Afrikanerdom both at home and abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the <a href="Ou%20Raadsaal">Raadsaal</a> by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential <a href="carriage">carriage</a>, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the <a href="Queen%27s%20Guard">Changing of the Guard</a> in Britain. "Once seen, he is not easily forgotten", wrote <a href="Florence%2C%20Lady%20Phillips">Lady Phillips</a>. "His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number ... and I think his character is clearly to be read in his face—strength of character and cunning."

By 1894 the Kosi Bay scheme had been abandoned and the Delagoa Bay line was almost complete, and the railways from Natal and the Cape had reached Johannesburg. Chief Malaboch's <a href="Malaboch%20War">insurgency</a> in the north compelled Joubert to call up a commando and the <a href="Transvaalse%20Staatsartillerie">State Artillery</a> in May 1894. Those drafted included British subjects, the large majority of whom indignantly refused to report, feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted. Kotzé's ruling that British nationality did not preclude one from conscription as a Transvaal resident prompted an outpouring of displeasure from the uitlanders that manifested itself when Loch visited Pretoria the following month. Protesters waited for Kruger and Loch to enter the presidential coach at the railway station, then unharnessed the horses, attached a <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> and raucously dragged the carriage to Loch's hotel. Embarrassed, Loch complied with Kruger's request that he should not go on to Johannesburg. Kruger announced that "the government will, in the meantime, provisionally, no more commandeer British subjects for personal military service". In his memoirs, he alleged that Loch secretly conferred with the uitlanders' <a href="Johannesburg%20Reform%20Committee">National Union</a> at this time about how long the miners could hold Johannesburg by arms without British help.
The following year the National Union sent Kruger a petition bearing 38,500 signatures requesting electoral reform. Kruger dismissed all such entreaties with the assertion that enfranchising "these new-comers, these disobedient persons" might imperil the republic's independence. "Protest!" he shouted at one uitlander deputation; "What is the use of protesting? I have the guns, you haven't." The Johannesburg press became intensely hostile to the President personally, using the term "Krugerism" to encapsulate all the republic's perceived injustices. In August 1895, after gauging burghers' views from across the country, the first volksraad rejected the opposition's bill to give all uitlanders the vote by 14 ballots to 10. Kruger said this did not extend to those who had "proved their trustworthiness", and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in Transvaal commandos.

The Delagoa Bay railway line was completed in December 1894—the realisation of a great personal ambition for Kruger, who tightened the final bolt of "our national railway" personally. The formal opening in July 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all the neighbouring territories present, including Loch's successor Sir Hercules Robinson. "This railway changed the whole internal situation in the Transvaal", Kruger wrote in his autobiography. "Until that time, the Cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly, so to speak, of the Johannesburg traffic." Difference of opinion between Kruger and Rhodes over the distribution of the profits from customs duties led to the <a href="Drifts%20Crisis">Drifts Crisis</a> of September–October 1895: the Cape Colony avoided the Transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead. Kruger's closure of the drifts (<a href="Ford%20%28crossing%29">fords</a>) in the Vaal River where the wagons crossed prompted Rhodes to call for support from Britain on the grounds that the London Convention was being breached. The Colonial Secretary <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> told Kruger if he did not reopen the drifts Britain would do so by force; Kruger backed down.
Understanding that renewed hostilities with Britain were now a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took with him an order from the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions. Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes pondered the co-ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland–Transvaal frontier under <a href="Leander%20Starr%20Jameson">Leander Starr Jameson</a>, the Chartered Company's administrator in Matabeleland. On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand—the <a href="Jameson%20Raid">Jameson Raid</a> had begun.

Jameson's force failed to cut all of the telegraph wires, allowing a rural Transvaal official to raise the alarm early, though there are suggestions Kruger had been tipped off some days before. Joubert called up the burghers and rode west to meet Jameson. Robinson publicly repudiated Jameson's actions and ordered him back, but Jameson ignored him and pushed on towards Johannesburg; Robinson wired Kruger offering to come immediately for talks. The Reform Committee's efforts to rally the uitlanders for revolt floundered, partly because not all of the mine-owners (or "<a href="Randlord">Randlord</a>s") were supportive, and by 31 December the conspirators had raised a makeshift "vierkleur" over their headquarters at the offices of Rhodes's <a href="Gold%20Fields">Gold Fields</a> company, signalling their capitulation. Unaware of this, Jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to Piet Cronjé on 2 January 1896.

A congratulatory <a href="Kruger%20telegram">telegram</a> to Kruger from Kaiser <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a> on 3 January prompted a storm of anti-Boer and <a href="Anti-German%20sentiment">anti-German feeling</a> in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk of the death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—<a href="Lionel%20Phillips">Lionel Phillips</a>, <a href="John%20Hays%20Hammond">John Hays Hammond</a>, <a href="Sir%20George%20Farrar%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Farrar</a> and <a href="Frank%20Rhodes%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Frank Rhodes</a> (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>25,000 each.

The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's political reputation in the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the <a href="Afrikaner%20Bond">Afrikaner Bond</a>; he resigned as prime minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as <a href="Olive%20Schreiner">Olive Schreiner</a> and <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a>, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, <a href="field%20gun">field gun</a>s and <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s, primarily from Germany and France.
In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, the young lawyer Kruger had encountered on the ship to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began to take exception to the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the <a href="Geneva%20Conventions">Geneva Convention</a>, which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except "vis-a-vis" the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called "nonsensical". Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence. Two months later <a href="Alfred%20Milner%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Milner">Sir Alfred Milner</a> became the new high commissioner and governor in Cape Town.

Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member <a href="Louis%20Botha">Louis Botha</a> reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it. A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice Kotzé abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. "This decision would have upset the whole country", Kruger recalled, "for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad." Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the volksraad decrees.
Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897–98 <a href="Transvaal%20presidential%20election%2C%201898">election</a> campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet—12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and <a href="Schalk%20Willem%20Burger">Schalk Willem Burger</a>'s 3,753—and was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotzé, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant. Milner called Kotzé's dismissal "the end of real justice in the Transvaal" and a step that "threatened all British subjects and interests there".

Kruger's final administration was, Meintjes suggests, the strongest in the history of the republic. He had the former Free State President F W Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, as <a href="Envoy%20%28title%29">Envoy Extraordinary</a> in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a>, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.

Anglo-German relations warmed during late 1898, with Berlin disavowing any interest in the Transvaal; this opened the way for Milner and Chamberlain to take a firmer line against Kruger. The so-called "Edgar case" of early 1899, in which a <a href="South%20African%20Republic%20Police">South African Republic Police</a>man was acquitted of <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> after shooting a British subject dead during an attempted arrest, prompted outcry from the British element in the Transvaal and is highlighted by Nathan as "the starting point of the final agitation which led to war".

The South African League, a new uitlander movement, prepared two petitions, each with more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking on the role of mediator. "You "must" make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede ... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends." Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not touch my independence", he said. "They must be reasonable in their demands."

Milner wanted full voting rights after five years' residence, a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for the new burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years' residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of the Free State. The High Commissioner declared his original request an "irreducible minimum" and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: "How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!" When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying "It is our country you want". Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary.

Back in Pretoria Kruger introduced a draft law to give the mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years' prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already in the country for nine years or more would get the vote immediately. <a href="Jan%20Hendrik%20Hofmeyr%20%28Onze%20Jan%29">Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr</a> of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty. Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would "formulate their own proposals for a final settlement".

Kruger resolved that war was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. "Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?" he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift <a href="pre-emptive%20strike">pre-emptive strike</a>. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy <a href="Conyngham%20Greene">Conyngham Greene</a> an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.

The outbreak of war raised Kruger's international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him this was a fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health—he turned 74 the week war broke out—but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly from his office in Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories and by the end of October were besieging <a href="Siege%20of%20Kimberley">Kimberley</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Ladysmith">Ladysmith</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Mafeking">Mafeking</a>. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be acting commandant-general.

The British relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers. Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand <a href="Boer%20foreign%20volunteers">foreign volunteers</a> (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Lord Roberts</a> took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to <a href="Machadodorp">Machadodorp</a>, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.

With the major towns and the railways under British control, the conventional phase of the war ended; Kruger wired Steyn pondering surrender, but the Free State President insisted they fight "to the bitter end". Kruger found new strength in Steyn and telegrammed all Transvaal officers forbidding the laying down of arms. "<a href="Bittereinder">Bittereinder</a>s" ("bitter-enders") under Botha, <a href="Christiaan%20de%20Wet">Christiaan de Wet</a> and <a href="Koos%20de%20la%20Rey">Koos de la Rey</a> took to the veld and waged a guerrilla campaign. The British under <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> applied <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policy in response, burning the farms of Boers still in the field; non-combatants (mostly women and children) were put into what the British Army dubbed <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s. Kruger moved to <a href="Waterval%20Onder">Waterval Onder</a>, where his small house became the "Krugerhof", in late June. After Roberts announced the annexation of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900—the Free State had been annexed on 24 May—Kruger proclaimed on 3 September that this was "not recognised" and "declared null and void". It was decided in the following days that to prevent his capture Kruger would leave for <a href="Maputo">Lourenço Marques</a> and there board ship for Europe. Officially he was to tour the continent, and perhaps America too, to raise support for the Boer cause.

Kruger left the Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept as the train crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first outgoing steamer, the "Herzog" of the <a href="Deutsche%20Ost-Afrika%20Linie">German East Africa Line</a>, but was prevented from doing so when, at the behest of the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a>. About a month later <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a> concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, <a href="HNLMS%20Gelderland%20%281898%29">HNLMS "Gelderland"</a>, and convey him through non-British waters to <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>. Kruger was delighted to hear of this but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. "Gelderland" departed on 20 October 1900.

He received a rapturous welcome in Marseille on 22 November—60,000 people turned out to see him disembark. Accompanied by Leyds, he went on to an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. "The Kaiser has betrayed us", he told Leyds. They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would feel more like home. After another buoyant reception from the general public Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch government to have them staying in the seat of government. The Kruger party moved to <a href="Hilversum">Hilversum</a> in April 1901.

Gezina, with whom Kruger had had 16 children—nine sons, seven daughters (of whom some died young)—had eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from the concentration camp at <a href="Krugersdorp">Krugersdorp</a>, where their mother had died, in July 1901. Five of the eight children died within nine days, and two weeks later Gezina also died. Meintjes writes that a "strange silence" enveloped Kruger thereafter. By now partially blind and almost totally deaf, he dictated his memoirs to his secretary Hermanus Christiaan "Madie" Bredell and Pieter Grobler during the latter part of 1901, and the following year they were published. Kruger and his entourage relocated in December 1901 to <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>, where he took a comfortable villa called "Oranjelust" and was joined by his daughter Elsje Eloff and her family.
Rhodes died in March 1902, bequeathing <a href="Groote%20Schuur">Groote Schuur</a> to be the official residence for future premiers of a unified South Africa. Kruger quipped to Bredell: "Perhaps I'll be the first." The war formally ended on 31 May 1902 with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Vereeniging">Treaty of Vereeniging</a>; the Boer republics became the <a href="Orange%20River%20Colony">Orange River</a> and <a href="Transvaal%20Colony">Transvaal Colonies</a>. Kruger accepted it was all over only when Bredell had the flags of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State removed from outside Oranjelust two weeks later. In reply to condolences from Germany, Kruger would only say: "My grief is beyond expression."

Kruger would not countenance the idea of returning home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile. Steyn similarly refused to accept the new order and joined Kruger in Europe, though he did later return. Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were berated by Kruger for "signing away independence"—rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them.

After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at <a href="Menton">Menton</a> on the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>, Kruger moved back to Hilversum, then returned to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to <a href="Clarens%2C%20Switzerland">Clarens</a>, a small village in the canton of <a href="Vaud">Vaud</a> in western Switzerland where he spent the rest of his days looking over <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> and the Alps from his balcony. "He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past", he wrote in his final letter, addressed to the people of the Transvaal. "Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again." After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him.

Kruger's body was initially buried in The Hague, but was soon repatriated with British permission. After ceremonial <a href="lying%20in%20state">lying in state</a>, he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the "vierkleur" of the South African Republic draped over his coffin, and buried in what is now called the <a href="Heroes%27%20Acre%20%28South%20Africa%29">Heroes' Acre</a> in the Church Street Cemetery.

Academic opinion on Kruger is divided. To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero; to critics he was "an anachronistic throwback", the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans. "More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of", writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image—"a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification", depicting Kruger as anything "from saint to stuffy mendacious savage". Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the "most extraordinary" of South Africans.

Following the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> under Botha in 1910, Kruger remained "a vital force in South African politics and Afrikaner culture". The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed <a href="Kruger%20National%20Park">Kruger National Park</a> in 1926. In 1954, over half a century after its construction by <a href="Anton%20van%20Wouw">Anton van Wouw</a>, a bronze <a href="Statue%20of%20Paul%20Kruger">statue of Kruger</a> in his characteristic <a href="Dopper%20suit">Dopper suit</a> and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods. Thirteen years later the <a href="South%20African%20Mint">South African Mint</a> put his likeness on the <a href="Krugerrand">Krugerrand</a>, a gold <a href="bullion%20coin">bullion coin</a> still produced and exported in the 21st century. His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are <a href="Provincial%20heritage%20site%20%28South%20Africa%29">provincial heritage sites</a>, the former of which is preserved to appear as in his time.

Kruger gives his name to the town of Krugersdorp, and to many streets and squares in South Africa and other countries, especially the Netherlands and Belgium. This has, on occasion, led to controversy; in 2009 local authorities in <a href="St%20Gallen">St Gallen</a>, Switzerland renamed "Krügerstrasse" "because of racist associations". <a href="Clarens%2C%20Free%20State">Clarens, Free State</a> is named after Kruger's last home in Switzerland. During the Second World War Kruger's life story and image were appropriated by propagandists in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, who produced the biographical film "<a href="Ohm%20Kr%C3%BCger">Ohm Krüger</a>" ("Uncle Krüger", 1941) to attack the British, with <a href="Emil%20Jannings">Emil Jannings</a> in the title role. The underdevelopment of <a href="South%20African%20administrative%20law">South African administrative law</a> until the late 20th century was, Davenport asserts, the direct result of Kruger's censure and dismissal of Chief Justice Kotzé in 1898 over the question of judicial review.

"Paul Kruger's name and fame he made himself", Leyds said. "It is sometimes said that he was illiterate. This is of course nonsense ... He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things." "In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master", E B Iwan-Müller asserted. "He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He was what I believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist." Soon after Kruger's death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner <a href="Emily%20Hobhouse">Emily Hobhouse</a>: "He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man—both morally and intellectually—whom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his 'never say die' attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us."

Maximus the Confessor

Maximus the Confessor (), also known as Maximus the Theologian and Maximus of Constantinople (c. 580 – 13 August 662), was a <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="monk">monk</a>, <a href="theologian">theologian</a>, and scholar.

In his early life, Maximus was a civil servant, and an aide to the <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a>. However, he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life. Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy, and certainly what was common for his time, the Platonic dialogues, the works of Aristotle, and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato, like <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>, <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>, <a href="Iamblichus">Iamblichus</a>, and <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a>. When one of his friends began espousing the <a href="Christology">Christological</a> position known as <a href="Monothelitism">Monothelitism</a>, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported an interpretation of the <a href="Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</a> formula on the basis of which it was asserted that <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> had both a human and a divine <a href="Will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a>. Maximus is <a href="veneration">venerated</a> in both the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> churches. He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions; following a trial, his tongue and right hand were mutilated.

He was then exiled and died on August 13, 662, in <a href="Tsageri">Tsageri</a> in present-day <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>. However, his theology was upheld by the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Third Council of Constantinople</a> and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. It is highly uncommon among the saints that he has two <a href="feast%20days">feast days</a>: 13 August and 21 January. His title of "<a href="Confessor%20of%20the%20Faith">Confessor</a>" means that he suffered for the Christian faith, but was not directly <a href="martyr">martyr</a>ed. The "<a href="Life%20of%20the%20Virgin%20%28Maximus%29">Life of the Virgin</a>", the only extant copy of which is in a Georgian translation, is commonly, albeit mistakenly, attributed to him, and is considered to be one of the earliest complete biographies of Mary, the mother of Jesus.

Very little is known about the details of Maximus' life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy. Numerous Maximian scholars call substantial portions of the Maronite biography into question, including Maximus' birth in Palestine, which was a common seventh century trope to discredit an opponent. Moreover, the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople, and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria. It is also very unlikely that anyone of low social birth, as the Maronite biography describes Maximus, could have ascended by the age of thirty to be the Protoasecretis of the Emperor Heraclius, one of the most powerful positions in the Empire. It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, etc. It is true, however, that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier Ambigua to John, to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests. Nevertheless, for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts, Maximus left public life and took <a href="monastic%20vows">monastic vows</a> at the monastery of <a href="Philippicus%20%28general%29">Philippicus</a> in Chrysopolis, a city across the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> from Constantinople (later known as Scutari, the modern Turkish city of <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Üsküdar</a>). Maximus was elevated to the position of <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of the monastery.

When the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Persians</a> conquered <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. It was there that he came under the tutelage of <a href="Sophronius%20of%20Jerusalem">Saint Sophronius</a>, and began studying in detail with him the Christological writings of <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and <a href="Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. According to I P Sheldon Williams his achievement was to set these doctrines into a framework of Aristotelian logic, which both suited the temper of the times and made them less liable to misinterpretation. Maximus continued his career as a theological and spiritual writer during his lengthy stay in Carthage. Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the <a href="exarch%20of%20Africa">exarch</a> <a href="Gregory%20the%20Patrician">Gregory</a>, the eparch <a href="George%20%28eparch%29">George</a> and the population as a holy man, ostensibly becoming an influential unofficial political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa.

While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">person</a> of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a> in 325, and were intensified following the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451. The <a href="Monothelite">Monothelite</a> position was developed as a compromise between the <a href="dyophysite">dyophysitists</a> and the <a href="miaphysitism">miaphysists</a>, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from <a href="Nestorianism">Nestorianism</a>. The Monothelites adhered to the <a href="Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</a> definition of the <a href="hypostatic%20union">hypostatic union</a>: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for "one will"), which led some to charge them with <a href="Apollinarism">Apollinarian</a> <a href="monophysitism">monophysitism</a>.
The Monothelite position was promulgated by <a href="Patriarch%20Sergius%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople</a> and by Maximus' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, <a href="Patriarch%20Pyrrhus%20of%20Constantinople">Pyrrhus</a>. Following the death of Sergius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed owing to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus' exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645. However, on the death of Emperor Heraclius and the accession of Emperor <a href="Constans%20II%20%28Byzantine%20Empire%29">Constans II</a>, Pyrrhus returned to Constantinople and recanted of his acceptance of the <a href="Dyothelite">Dyothelite</a> ("two wills") position.

Maximus may have remained in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected <a href="Pope%20Martin%20I">Pope Martin I</a> convened the <a href="Lateran%20Council%20of%20649">Lateran Council of 649</a> at the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St.%20John%20Lateran">Lateran Basilica</a> in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from <a href="Constans%20II%20%28Byzantine%20Empire%29">Constans II</a>, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.

Maximus' refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> to be tried as a <a href="Heresy">heretic</a> in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">in Egypt</a> and <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Maghreb">North Africa</a>, which he rejected as slander.

In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the <a href="Lazica">Lazica</a> or <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a> region of modern-day <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and was cast in the fortress of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of <a href="Tsageri">Tsageri</a>. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by <a href="Anastasius%20Bibliothecarius">Anastasius Bibliothecarius</a>.

Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Third Council of Constantinople</a> (the Sixth <a href="Ecumenical%20Council">Ecumenical Council</a>, 680–681), which declared that <a href="Christ">Christ</a> possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent of all charges against him.

Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as <a href="saint">saint</a>s shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb. In the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> the veneration of Maximus began prior to the foundation of the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Causes%20of%20Saints">Congregation for the Causes of Saints</a>.

Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical "Spe Salvi" (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus 'the great Greek doctor of the Church', although it's not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus 'Doctor of the Church' or to say that he already was one.

As a student of <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier <a href="Neo-Platonic">Neo-Platonic</a> philosophy, including the thought of such figures as <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a> and <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a>. Maximus' work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by <a href="Johannes%20Scotus%20Eriugena">John Scotus Eriugena</a> at the request of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>.

The Platonic influence on Maximus' thought can be seen most clearly in his <a href="Philosophical%20anthropology">theological anthropology</a>. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of <a href="Neoplatonism%23Teachings">exitus-reditus</a> (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made in the <a href="Imago%20Dei">image of God</a>, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on <a href="divinization%20%28Christian%29">divinization</a> or "<a href="Theosis%20%28Eastern%20Orthodox%20theology%29">theosis</a>" helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.

Christologically Maximus insisted on a strict <a href="dyophysitism">dyophysitism</a>, which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on "theosis". In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.
Furthermore, in his works Maximus the Confessor argued the unconditionality of the divine incarnation.

Regarding salvation, Maximus has been described as a proponent of "<a href="apocatastasis">apocatastasis</a>" or <a href="universal%20reconciliation">universal reconciliation</a>, the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed, like <a href="Origen">Origen</a> and <a href="St.%20Gregory%20of%20Nyssa">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>. While this claim has been disputed, others have argued that Maximus shared this belief in <a href="universal%20reconciliation">universal reconciliation</a> with his most spiritually mature students.

Maximus' work was translated by the 9th-century <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> philosopher and mystical theologian <a href="Johannes%20Scotus%20Eriugena">Johannes Scotus Eriugena</a>. In <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>, Maximus has always been influential. The Eastern theologians <a href="Symeon%20the%20New%20Theologian">Symeon the New Theologian</a> and <a href="Gregory%20Palamas">Gregory Palamas</a> are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus. Further, a number of Maximus' works are included in the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "<a href="Philokalia">Philokalia</a>", a collection of some of the most influential <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christian</a> writers.

Arlington, Washington

Arlington is a city in northern <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish County, Washington</a>, United States, part of the <a href="Seattle%20metropolitan%20area">Seattle metropolitan area</a>. The city lies on the <a href="Stillaguamish%20River">Stillaguamish River</a> in the western foothills of the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, adjacent to the city of <a href="Marysville%2C%20Washington">Marysville</a>. It is approximately north of <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a>, and north of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, the region's largest city. As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 U.S. census</a>, Arlington has a population of 17,926.

Arlington was established in the 1880s by settlers and the area was <a href="plat">plat</a>ted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was <a href="Municipal%20incorporation">incorporated</a> as a city in 1903. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, the Arlington area was the site of major projects undertaken for employment under the direction of federal relief agencies, including construction of a <a href="Arlington%20Municipal%20Airport%20%28Washington%29">municipal airport</a> that would serve as a <a href="naval%20air%20station">naval air station</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington was affected by <a href="suburbanization">suburbanization</a> due to the expansion of Seattle, growing by more than 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of <a href="Smokey%20Point%2C%20Washington">Smokey Point</a> to the southwest.

The economy of the Arlington area historically relied on <a href="timber">timber</a> and <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. In the early 21st century, it has transitioned to a <a href="service%20economy">service economy</a>, with some <a href="aviation">aviation</a> industry jobs near the municipal airport. The city is governed by a <a href="mayor%E2%80%93council%20government">mayor–council government</a>, electing a mayor and seven city councilmembers. The municipal government maintains the city's <a href="park">park</a>s system and <a href="water%20utility">water and wastewater utilities</a>. Other services, including <a href="public%20utility">public utilities</a>, <a href="public%20transport">public transport</a>ation, and schools, are contracted to regional or county-level agencies and companies.

Prior to American settlement in the 19th century, the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20region">Puget Sound region</a> was inhabited by <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> <a href="Coast%20Salish">Coast Salish</a> peoples. The <a href="Stillaguamish%20people">Stillaguamish</a> and <a href="Sauk-Suiattle">Sauk</a> peoples had prominent camps at the confluence of the two forks of the <a href="Stillaguamish%20River">Stillaguamish River</a> when they followed <a href="fish%20migration">fish runs</a>; the Stillaguamish named the campsite . Arlington was later developed at this site. They also had a major village at upriver near modern-day <a href="Trafton%2C%20Washington">Trafton</a>.

American exploration of the area began in 1851, when <a href="prospecting">prospector</a> Samuel Hancock was led by Indian guides on a <a href="canoe">canoe</a> up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to <a href="logging">logging</a> after the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Point%20Elliott">Treaty of Point Elliott</a> in 1855 between the United States government and the Stillaguamish tribe, who were relocated to <a href="Off-reservation%20trust%20land">trust lands</a> and the <a href="Tulalip%20Indian%20Reservation">Tulalip Indian Reservation</a>.

The <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> built a <a href="military%20road">military road</a> connecting <a href="Fort%20Steilacoom">Fort Steilacoom</a> to <a href="Fort%20Bellingham">Fort Bellingham</a>, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence. In the 1880s, <a href="wagon%20road">wagon road</a>s were constructed to this area from the towns of <a href="Marysville%2C%20Washington">Marysville</a> to the south and <a href="Silvana%2C%20Washington">Silvana</a> to the west, bringing entrepreneurs to the logging camps, informally named "The Forks". The area's first store was opened in 1888 by Nels K. Tvete and Nils C. Johnson, and was followed by a hotel with lodging and meals for loggers.

Two settlements were established on the south side of the confluence in anticipation of the <a href="Seattle%2C%20Lake%20Shore%20%26amp%3B%20Eastern%20Railroad">Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railroad</a> building a track through the area. G. Morris Haller, son of Colonel <a href="Granville%20O.%20Haller">Granville O. Haller</a>, founded a settlement on the banks of the Stillaguamish River in 1883, naming it "Haller City".

The Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railroad chose to build its <a href="railroad%20depot">depot</a> on higher ground to the south of Haller City, leading contractors Earl & McLeod to establish a new town at the depot on March 15, 1890. The new town was named "Arlington" after <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Lord Henry Arlington</a>, member of the cabinet of King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> of England. Arlington and Haller City were <a href="plat">plat</a>ted within a month of each other in 1890, quickly developing a rivalry that would continue for several years.

Arlington and Haller City grew rapidly in their first years, reaching a combined population of 500 by 1893, relying on agriculture, dairy farming and the manufacturing of <a href="wood%20shingle">wood shingle</a>s as their main sources of income. Both towns established their own schools, post offices, saloons, general stores, churches, social clubs, and hotels. The two towns were separated by a tract claimed by two settlers in 1891, preventing either town from fully absorbing the other. During the late 1890s, the claim dispute was settled and merchants began moving to the larger, more prosperous Arlington, signalling the end for Haller City. Today, Haller City is memorialized in the name of a park in downtown Arlington, as well as a <a href="middle%20school">middle school</a> operated by the Arlington School District.

Arlington was <a href="Municipal%20incorporation">incorporated</a> as a <a href="City%20government%20in%20Washington%20%28state%29">fourth-class city</a> on May 20, 1903, including the remnants of Haller City (located north of modern-day Division Street). The incorporation came after a referendum on May 5, in which 134 of 173 voters approved the city's incorporation. The new city elected shingle mill owner John M. Smith as its first mayor. In the years following incorporation, Arlington gained a local <a href="bank">bank</a>, a <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a> <a href="creamery">creamery</a>, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service.

During the early 20th century, Arlington's largest employers remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, during a period of growth for the city. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s forced all but one of the mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities.

Public transportation in Arlington is provided by <a href="Community%20Transit">Community Transit</a>, a public transit authority that operates in most of Snohomish County. Community Transit runs all-day local bus service on one route from Downtown Arlington to Smokey Point, as well as four other routes to Marysville, Everett, <a href="Lake%20Stevens%2C%20Washington">Lake Stevens</a>, <a href="Lynnwood%2C%20Washington">Lynnwood</a>, and <a href="Stanwood%2C%20Washington">Stanwood</a> from a <a href="transit%20center">transit center</a> in Smokey Point. During <a href="peak%20hour">peak hour</a>s, Community Transit also provides local service from Darrington, and commuter service to the Boeing Everett Factory from a <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> in downtown Arlington.

Arlington has one active railroad, a <a href="spur%20line">spur line</a> from Marysville to downtown Arlington operated by <a href="BNSF%20Railway">BNSF Railway</a> (the successor to Burlington Northern). As part of the development of the Arlington Airport business park, BNSF Railway will build two rail spurs leading to the airport in the near future. Arlington does not have <a href="passenger%20rail">passenger rail</a> service, but is near <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> stations in <a href="Everett%20Station">Everett</a> and <a href="Stanwood%20station">Stanwood</a>.

Historically, Arlington developed along several railroads that have since been abandoned or re-purposed. The <a href="Seattle%2C%20Lake%20Shore%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway</a>, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north–south through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–United States border</a>. In 1892, it was acquired by the <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Railway">Northern Pacific Railway</a>, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial Trail in the 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government plans to use the right of way for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail.

The city of Arlington owns the Arlington Municipal Airport, located southwest of downtown Arlington. The airport is primarily used for <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a> and light business, and is home to 475 aircraft, including 10 helicopters, 20 <a href="glider%20%28aircraft%29">gliders</a>, and 23 <a href="Ultralight%20aircraft%20%28United%20States%29">ultra-light aircraft</a>. Approximately 130 businesses are located on airport property, of which one-quarter are involved in aviation-related uses directly impacting the airport. In the 1990s, the airport was explored as a candidate for expansion into a <a href="regional%20airport">regional airport</a> to relieve <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>. The plan was ultimately abandoned by 1996, as the Puget Sound Regional Council instead chose to construct a third runway at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

<a href="Electric%20power">Electric power</a> in Arlington is provided by the <a href="Snohomish%20County%20Public%20Utility%20District">Snohomish County Public Utility District</a> (PUD), a consumer-owned <a href="public%20utility">public utility</a> that purchases most of its electricity from the federal <a href="Bonneville%20Power%20Administration">Bonneville Power Administration</a> (BPA). The BPA operates the region's system of <a href="Electric%20power%20transmission">electrical transmission lines</a>, including <a href="WECC%20Intertie%20Paths">Path 3</a>, a major national transmission corridor running along the eastern side of Arlington towards <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. <a href="Cascade%20Natural%20Gas">Cascade Natural Gas</a> and <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Energy">Puget Sound Energy</a> provide <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> to Arlington residents and businesses north and south of State Route 531, respectively; two major north–south gas <a href="pipeline%20transport">pipelines</a> run through Arlington and are maintained by the <a href="Olympic%20Pipeline%20Company">Olympic Pipeline Company</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="BP">BP</a>, and the Northwest Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of <a href="Williams%20Companies">Williams Companies</a>.

Tadeusz Kościuszko

Andrzej Tadeusz Bonawentura Kościuszko ("Andrew Thaddeus Bonaventure Kosciuszko"; February 4 or 12, 1746 – October 15, 1817) was a Polish-Lithuanian <a href="military%20engineer">military engineer</a>, statesman, and military leader who became a national hero in <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. He fought in the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>'s struggles against <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, and on the U.S. side in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. As Supreme Commander of the Polish National Armed Forces, he led the 1794 <a href="Ko%C5%9Bciuszko%20Uprising">Kościuszko Uprising</a>.

Kościuszko was born in February 1746, in a manor house on the <a href="Miera%C4%8Do%C5%AD%C5%A1%C4%8Dyna">Mereczowszczyzna</a> estate in <a href="Brest%20Litovsk%20Voivodeship">Brest Litovsk Voivodeship</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At age 20, he graduated from the <a href="Corps%20of%20Cadets%20%28Warsaw%29">Corps of Cadets</a> in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Poland. After the start of civil war in the <a href="Bar%20Confederation">Bar Confederation</a> in 1768, Kościuszko moved to France in 1769 to study. He returned to Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1774, two years after its <a href="First%20Partition%20of%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">First Partition</a>, and took a position as tutor in <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Sylwester%20Sosnowski">Józef Sylwester Sosnowski</a>'s household. After Kościuszko attempted to elope with his employer's daughter and was severely beaten by the father's retainers, he returned to France. In 1776, Kościuszko moved to North America, where he took part in the American Revolutionary War as a <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>. An accomplished military architect, he designed and oversaw the construction of state-of-the-art fortifications, including those at <a href="West%20Point">West Point</a>, New York. In 1783, in recognition of his services, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> promoted him to <a href="Brigadier%20General">brigadier general</a>.

Upon returning to Poland in 1784, Kościuszko was commissioned as a <a href="major%20general">major general</a> in the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Army</a> in 1789. After the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Russian%20War%20of%201792">Polish–Russian War of 1792</a> resulted in the <a href="Second%20Partition%20of%20Poland">Second Partition of Poland</a>, he organized an uprising against Russia in March 1794, serving as its "Naczelnik" (commander-in-chief). Russian forces captured him at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Maciejowice">Battle of Maciejowice</a> in October 1794. The defeat of the Kościuszko Uprising that November led to Poland's <a href="Third%20Partition%20of%20Poland">Third Partition</a> in 1795, which ended the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's independent existence for 123 years. In 1796, following the death of Tsaritsa <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine the Great</a>, Kościuszko was pardoned by her successor, Tsar <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I</a>, and he emigrated to the United States. A close friend of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s, with whom he shared ideals of human rights, Kościuszko wrote <a href="Wills%20of%20Tadeusz%20Ko%C5%9Bciuszko">a will</a> in 1798 dedicating his U.S. assets to the education and freedom of U.S. slaves. He eventually returned to Europe and lived in Switzerland until his death in 1817. The execution of his will later proved difficult, and the funds were never used for the purpose he had intended.

Kościuszko was born in February 1746 in a manor house on the estate called "Mereczowszczyzna" near Kosów, (now <a href="Kosava%2C%20Belarus">Kosava, Belarus</a>) in <a href="Nowogr%C3%B3dek%20Voivodeship%20%281507%E2%80%931795%29">Nowogródek Voivodeship</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, a part of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. His exact birthdate is unknown; commonly cited are February 4 and February 12.

Kościuszko was the youngest son of a member of the "<a href="szlachta">szlachta (nobility)</a>", Ludwik Tadeusz Kościuszko, an officer in the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Army</a>, and his wife Tekla, "née" Ratomska. The Kościuszkos held the Polish "<a href="Roch%20III%20coat%20of%20arms">Roch III coat of arms</a>". At the time of Tadeusz Kościuszko's birth, the family possessed modest landholdings in the Grand Duchy, which were worked by 31 peasant families.

Tadeusz was baptized by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> church and the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a>, thereby receiving the names "Andrzej", "Tadeusz", and "Bonawentura". His paternal family was ethnically <a href="Great%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuanian</a>–<a href="Ruthenian%20people">Ruthenian</a> and traced their ancestry to Konstanty Fiodorowicz Kostiuszko, a courtier of <a href="Monarchs%20of%20Poland">Polish King</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</a> <a href="Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old">Sigismund I the Old</a>. Kościuszko's maternal family, the Ratomskis, were also Ruthenian.
Modern Belarusian writers interpret his Ruthenian or Lithuanian heritage as <a href="Belarusians">Belarusian</a>. He once described himself as a "<a href="Litvin">Litvin</a>", a term that denoted inhabitants, of whatever ethnicity, of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Modern Belarusian writers interpret "Litvin" as designating a Belarusian, before the word "Belarusian" had come into use. Kościuszko, however, did not speak the <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian language</a>; his family had become <a href="Polonization">Polonized</a> as early as the 16th century. Like most Polish–Lithuanian nobility of the time, the Kościuszkos spoke <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> and identified with <a href="Polish%20culture">Polish culture</a>.

In 1755, Kościuszko began attending school in <a href="Lyubeshiv">Lyubeshiv</a>, but never finished due to his family's financial straits after his father's death in 1758. Poland's King <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20August%20Poniatowski">Stanisław August Poniatowski</a> established a <a href="Corps%20of%20Cadets%20%28Warsaw%29">Corps of Cadets</a> ("Korpus Kadetów") in 1765, at what is now <a href="Warsaw%20University">Warsaw University</a>, to educate <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">military officers</a> and government officials. Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18, 1765, likely thanks to the patronage of the <a href="Czartoryski%20family">Czartoryski family</a>. The school emphasized military subjects and the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a>, and after graduating on December 20, 1766, Kościuszko was promoted to "<a href="chor%C4%85%C5%BCy">chorąży</a>" (a military rank roughly equivalent to modern <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>); he stayed on as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>.

In 1768, civil war broke out in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the <a href="Bar%20Confederation">Bar Confederation</a> sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought on the side of the insurgents. Faced with a difficult choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist <a href="Aleksander%20Or%C5%82owski">Aleksander Orłowski</a>, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20royale%20de%20peinture%20et%20de%20sculpture">Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture</a>. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect <a href="Jean-Rodolphe%20Perronet">Jean-Rodolphe Perronet</a>.

Kościuszko, however, did not give up on improving his military knowledge. He audited lectures for five years and frequented the libraries of the Paris military academies. His exposure to the French <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, along with the <a href="religious%20tolerance">religious tolerance</a> practiced in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, strongly influenced his later career. The French economic theory of <a href="physiocracy">physiocracy</a> made a particularly strong impression on his thinking. He also developed his artistic skills, and while his career would take him in a different direction, all his life he continued drawing and painting.

In the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in 1772, <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> and Austria annexed large swaths of Polish–Lithuanian territory and gained influence over the internal politics of the reduced Polish and Lithuanian states. When Kościuszko finally returned home in 1774, he found that his brother Józef had squandered most of the family fortune, and there was no place for him in the Army, as he could not afford to buy an officer's commission. He took a position as tutor to the family of the <a href="Magnates%20of%20Poland%20and%20Lithuania">magnate</a>, <a href="wojewoda">province governor</a> (voivode) and <a href="hetman">hetman</a> <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Sylwester%20Sosnowski">Józef Sylwester Sosnowski</a> and fell in love with the governor's daughter <a href="Ludwika%20Sosnowska">Ludwika</a>. Their elopement was thwarted by her father's retainers. Kościuszko received a thrashing at their hands, an event that may have led to his later antipathy to class distinctions.

In the autumn of 1775, he decided to emigrate to avoid Sosnowski and his retainers. In late 1775, he attempted to join the <a href="Saxony">Saxon</a> army but was turned down and decided to return to Paris. There he learned of the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, in which the British colonies in North America had revolted against the crown and begun their struggle for independence. The first American successes were well-publicized in France, and the French people and government openly supported the revolutionaries' cause.

On learning of the American Revolution, Kościuszko, himself a man of revolutionary aspirations, sympathetic to the American cause and an advocate of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>, sailed for America in June 1776 along with other foreign officers, likely with the help of a French supporter of the American revolutionaries, <a href="Pierre%20Beaumarchais">Pierre Beaumarchais</a>. On August 30, 1776, Kościuszko submitted an application to the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>; he was assigned to the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> the next day.

Kościuszko's first task was building fortifications at <a href="Fort%20Billingsport">Fort Billingsport</a> in <a href="Paulsboro">Paulsboro</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, to protect the banks of the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a> and prevent a possible <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> advance up the river to Philadelphia. He initially served as a volunteer in the employ of <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, but on October 18, 1776, Congress commissioned him a colonel of engineers in the Continental Army.

In spring 1777, Kościuszko was attached to the <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Northern Army</a> under <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, arriving at the Canada–US border in May 1777. Subsequently posted to <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>, he reviewed the defenses of what had been one of the most formidable fortresses in North America. His surveys prompted him to strongly recommend the construction of a battery on <a href="Mount%20Defiance%20%28New%20York%29">Sugar Loaf</a>, a high point overlooking the fort. His prudent recommendation, in which his fellow engineers concurred, was turned down by the garrison commander, Brigadier General <a href="Arthur%20St.%20Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a>.

This proved a tactical blunder: when a British army under General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> arrived in July 1777, Burgoyne did exactly what Kościuszko had warned of and had his engineers place <a href="artillery">artillery</a> on the hill. With the British in complete control of the high ground, the Americans realized their situation was hopeless and abandoned the fortress with hardly a shot fired in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga%20%281777%29">Siege of Ticonderoga</a>. The British advance force nipped hard on the heels of the outnumbered and exhausted Continentals as they fled south. Major General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a>, desperate to put distance between his men and their pursuers, ordered Kościuszko to delay the enemy. Kościuszko designed an engineer's solution: his men felled trees, dammed streams, and destroyed bridges and <a href="causeways">causeways</a>. Encumbered by their huge supply train, the British began to bog down, giving the Americans the time needed to safely withdraw across the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>.

Gates tapped Kościuszko to survey the country between the opposing armies, choose the most defensible position, and fortify it. Finding just such a position near <a href="Saratoga%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga</a>, overlooking the Hudson at <a href="Bemis%20Heights">Bemis Heights</a>, Kościuszko laid out a strong array of defenses, nearly impregnable from any direction. His judgment and meticulous attention to detail frustrated the British attacks during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a>, and Gates accepted the surrender of Burgoyne's <a href="Convention%20Army">force</a> there on October 16, 1777. The dwindling British army had been dealt a sound defeat, turning the tide to an American advantage. Kościuszko's work at Saratoga received great praise from Gates, who later told his friend Dr. <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a>: "[T]he great tacticians of the campaign were hills and forests, which a young Polish engineer was skillful enough to select for my encampment."

At some point in 1777, Kościuszko composed a <a href="polonaise">polonaise</a> and scored it for the <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>. Named for him, and with lyrics by <a href="Rajnold%20Suchodolski">Rajnold Suchodolski</a>, it later became popular with Polish patriots during the <a href="November%20Uprising">November 1830 Uprising</a>. Around that time, Kościuszko was assigned a black orderly, <a href="Agrippa%20Hull">Agrippa Hull</a>, whom he would treat as an equal and a friend.

In March 1778 Kościuszko arrived at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>, and spent more than two years strengthening the fortifications and improving the stronghold's defenses. It was these defenses that the American General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> subsequently attempted to surrender to the British when he became a traitor. Soon after Kościuszko had finished fortifying West Point, in August 1780, General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> granted Kościuszko's request to transfer to combat duty with the Southern Army. Kościuszko's West Point fortifications would be widely praised as innovative for the time.

After traveling south through rural <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> in October 1780, Kościuszko proceeded to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> to report to his former commander General Gates. However, following Gates's disastrous defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Camden</a> on August 16, 1780, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> had selected Washington's choice, Major General <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>, to replace the disgraced Gates as commander of the Southern Department. When Greene formally assumed command on December 3, 1780, he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer. By then, he had been praised by both Gates and Greene.

Over the course of this campaign, Kościuszko was placed in command of building <a href="bateaux">bateaux</a>, siting the location for camps, scouting river crossings, fortifying positions, and developing intelligence contacts. Many of his contributions were instrumental in preventing the destruction of the Southern Army. This was especially so during the famous <a href="Nathanael%20Greene%23The%20race%20to%20the%20Dan%20River">"Race to the Dan"</a>, when British General <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a> chased Greene across of rough back country in January and February 1781. Thanks largely to a combination of Greene's tactics, and Kościuszko's bateaux, and accurate scouting of the rivers ahead of the main body, the Continentals safely crossed each river, including the <a href="Yadkin%20River">Yadkin</a> and the <a href="Dan%20River">Dan</a>. Cornwallis, having no boats, and finding no way to cross the swollen Dan, finally gave up the chase and withdrew back into North Carolina. The Continentals regrouped south of <a href="Halifax%2C%20Virginia">Halifax, Virginia</a>, where Kościuszko had earlier, at Greene's request, established a fortified depot.

During the Race to the Dan, Kościuszko had helped select the site where Greene eventually returned to fight Cornwallis at <a href="Battle%20of%20Guilford%20Court%20House">Guilford Courthouse</a>. Though tactically defeated, the Americans all but destroyed Cornwallis' army as an effective fighting force and gained a permanent strategic advantage in the South. Thus, when Greene began his reconquest of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> in the spring of 1781, he summoned Kościuszko to rejoin the main body of the Southern Army. The combined forces of the Continentals and Southern <a href="militia">militia</a> gradually forced the British from the back country into the coastal ports during the latter half of 1781 and, on August 16, Kościuszko participated in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Camden">Second Battle of Camden</a>. At <a href="Ninety%20Six%2C%20South%20Carolina">Ninety Six</a>, Kościuszko <a href="Siege%20of%20Ninety-Six">besieged the Star Fort</a> from May 22 to June 18. During the unsuccessful siege, he suffered his only wound in seven years of service, <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>ted in the buttocks during an assault by the fort's defenders on the approach trench that he was constructing.

Kościuszko subsequently helped fortify the American bases in North Carolina, before taking part in several smaller operations in the final year of hostilities, harassing British foraging parties near <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. He had become engaged in these operations after the death of his friend Colonel <a href="John%20Laurens">John Laurens</a>, taking over Laurens's intelligence network in the area. He commanded two cavalry squadrons and an infantry unit, and his last known battlefield command of the war occurred at <a href="James%20Island%2C%20South%20Carolina">James Island, South Carolina</a>, on November 14, 1782. In what has been described as <a href="Battle%20of%20James%20Island">the Continental Army's final armed action of the war</a>, he was very nearly killed as his small force was routed. A month later, he was among the Continental troops that reoccupied Charleston following the British evacuation of the city. Kościuszko spent the rest of the war there, conducting a fireworks display on April 23, 1783, to celebrate the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> earlier that month.

Having not been paid in his seven years of service, in late May 1783, Kościuszko decided to collect the salary owed to him. That year, he was asked by <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress</a> to supervise the fireworks during the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">July 4</a> celebrations at <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>. On October 13, 1783, Congress promoted him to brigadier general, but he still had not received his back pay; many other officers and soldiers were in the same situation. While waiting for his pay, unable even to finance a voyage back to Europe, Kościuszko, like a number of others, lived on money borrowed from the Polish-Jewish banker <a href="Haym%20Solomon">Haym Solomon</a>. Eventually, he would receive a certificate for 12,280 dollars, at 6%, to be paid on January 1, 1784, and the right to of land, but only if he chose to settle in the United States. For the winter of 1783–84, his former commanding officer, General Greene, invited Kościuszko to stay at his mansion. He was also inducted into the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>.

On July 15, 1784, Kościuszko set off for Poland, where he arrived on August 26. Due to a conflict between his patrons, the Czartoryski family, and King Stanisław August Poniatowski, Kościuszko once again failed to get a commission in the Commonwealth Army. He settled in <a href="Siechnowicze">Siechnowicze</a> (, now <a href="Sehnovichi">Sehnovichi</a>, Belarus). His brother Józef had lost most of the family's lands through bad investments, but with the help of his sister Anna, Kościuszko secured part of the lands for himself. He decided to limit his male peasants' "<a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a>" (obligatory service to the lord of the manor) to two days a week, and completely exempted the female peasants. His estate soon stopped being profitable, and he began going into debt. The situation was not helped by failure of the money promised by the American government—interest on late payment for his seven years' military service—to materialize. Kościuszko struck up friendships with liberal activists; <a href="Hugo%20Ko%C5%82%C5%82%C4%85taj">Hugo Kołłątaj</a> offered him a position as lecturer at <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>'s <a href="Jagiellonian%20University">Jagiellonian University</a>, which Kościuszko declined.

Finally the <a href="Great%20Sejm">Great Sejm</a> of 1788–92 introduced some reforms, including a planned build-up of the army to defend the Commonwealth's borders. Kościuszko saw a chance to return to military service and spent some time in Warsaw, among those who engaged in the political debates outside the Great Sejm. He wrote a proposal to create a militia force, on the American model. As political pressure grew to build up the army, and Kościuszko's political allies gained influence with the King, Kościuszko again applied for a commission, and on October 12, 1789, received a royal commission as a <a href="major%20general">major general</a>. He began receiving the high salary of 12,000 "<a href="Polish%20zloty">złoty</a>" a year, ending his financial difficulties. He asked for a transfer to the Lithuanian army but was instead assigned to a unit in the west, in <a href="Greater%20Poland">Greater Poland</a>. On February 1, 1790, he reported for duty in <a href="W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek">Włocławek</a>, and in mid-March he was given a command. Around summer, he commanded some infantry and cavalry units in the region between the <a href="Bug%20River">Bug</a> and <a href="Vistula">Vistula Rivers</a>. In August 1790 he was posted to <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>, stationed near <a href="Starokostiantyniv">Starokostiantyniv</a> and <a href="Mi%C4%99dzyborze">Międzyborze</a>. Prince <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Poniatowski">Józef Poniatowski</a>, who happened to be the King's nephew, recognized Kościuszko's superior experience and made him his second-in-command, leaving him in command when he was absent.

Meanwhile, Kościuszko became more closely involved with the political reformers, befriending Hugo Kołłątaj, <a href="Julian%20Ursyn%20Niemcewicz">Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz</a> and others. Kościuszko argued that the peasants and Jews should receive full citizenship status, as this would motivate them to help defend Poland in the event of war. The political reformers centered in the <a href="Patriotic%20Party">Patriotic Party</a> scored a major victory with the adoption of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20May%203%2C%201791">Constitution of May 3, 1791</a>. Kościuszko saw the Constitution as a step in the right direction, but was disappointed that it retained the monarchy and did little to improve the situation of the most underprivileged, the peasants and the Jews. The Commonwealth's neighbors saw the Constitution's reforms as a threat to their influence over Polish internal affairs. A year after the Constitution's adoption, on May 14, 1792, reactionary magnates formed the <a href="Targowica%20Confederation">Targowica Confederation</a>, which asked Russia's <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsaritsa Catherine II</a> for help in overthrowing the Constitution. Four days later, on May 18, 1792, a 100,000-man Russian army crossed the Polish border, headed for Warsaw, beginning the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Russian%20War%20of%201792">Polish–Russian War of 1792</a>.

The Russians had a 3:1 advantage in strength, with some 98,000 troops against 37,000 Poles; they also had an advantage in combat experience. Before the Russians invaded, Kościuszko had been appointed deputy commander of Prince Józef Poniatowski's infantry division, stationed in <a href="West%20Ukraine">West Ukraine</a>. When the Prince became <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the entire Polish (Crown) Army on May 3, 1792, Kościuszko was given command of a division near <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>.

The Russians attacked on a wide front with three armies. Kościuszko proposed that the entire Polish army be concentrated and engage one of the Russian armies, in order to assure numerical parity and boost the morale of the mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory; but Poniatowski rejected this plan. On May 22, 1792, the Russian forces crossed the border in Ukraine, where Kościuszko and Poniatowski were stationed. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four enemy columns advancing into West Ukraine, and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the <a href="Southern%20Bug">Southern Bug River</a>, with Kościuszko commanding the rear guard. On June 18, Poniatowski won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ziele%C5%84ce">Battle of Zieleńce</a>; Kościuszko's division, on detached rear-guard duty, did not take part in the battle and rejoined the main army only at nightfall; nonetheless, his diligent protection of the main army's rear and flanks won him the newly created <a href="Virtuti%20Militari">Virtuti Militari</a>, to this day Poland's highest military decoration. (Storożyński, however, states that Kościuszko received the Virtuti Militari for his later, July 18 <a href="Battle%20of%20Dubienka">victory at Dubienka</a>.) The Polish withdrawal continued, and on July 7 Kościuszko's forces fought a delaying battle against the Russians at <a href="Volodymyr-Volynskyi">Volodymyr-Volynskyi</a> (the <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C5%82odzimierz">Battle of Włodzimierz</a>). On reaching the northern Bug River, the Polish Army was split into three divisions to hold the river defensive line—weakening the Poles' point numerical superiority, against Kościuszko's counsel of a single strong, concentrated army.

Kościuszko's force was assigned to protect the front's southern flank, touching up to the Austrian border. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dubienka">Battle of Dubienka</a> (July 18, 1792) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy, skilfully using terrain obstacles and field fortifications, and came to be regarded as one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the age. With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General <a href="Michail%20Kachovski">Michail Kachovski</a>. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.

After the battle, King Stanisław August Poniatowski promoted Kościuszko to <a href="Lieutenant%20General">lieutenant-general</a> and also offered him the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29">Order of the White Eagle</a>, but Kościuszko, a convinced republican would not accept a royal honor. News of Kościuszko's victory spread over Europe, and on August 26 he received the <a href="List%20of%20people%20granted%20honorary%20French%20citizenship%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution">honorary citizenship of France</a> from the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20%28France%29">Legislative Assembly</a> of <a href="revolutionary%20France">revolutionary France</a>. While Kościuszko considered the war's outcome to still be unsettled, the King requested a ceasefire. On July 24, 1792, before Kościuszko had received his promotion to lieutenant-general, the King shocked the army by announcing his accession to the Targowica Confederation and ordering the Polish–Lithuanian armies to cease hostilities against the Russians. Kościuszko considered abducting the King as the <a href="Bar%20Confederacy">Bar Confederates</a> had done two decades earlier, in 1771, but was dissuaded by Prince Józef Poniatowski. On August 30 Kościuszko resigned his army position and briefly returned to Warsaw, where he received his promotion and pay, but refused the King's request that he remain in the Army. Around that time, he also fell ill with <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>.

The King's capitulation was a hard blow for Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at <a href="Sieniawa">Sieniawa</a>, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in <a href="Lw%C3%B3w">Lwów</a> (in Ukrainian, "Lviv"; in German, "Lemberg"), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. <a href="Izabela%20Czartoryska">Izabela Czartoryska</a> discussed having him marry her daughter <a href="Zofia%20Czartoryska">Zofia</a>. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who <a href="Austrian%20Partition">held Lwów</a>, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At the turn of the month, he stopped in <a href="Zamo%C5%9B%C4%87">Zamość</a> at the <a href="Zamoyski%20family">Zamoyskis'</a> estate, met <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Staszic">Stanisław Staszic</a>, then went on to <a href="Pu%C5%82awy">Puławy</a>.

He did not tarry long there either: on December 12–13, he was in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>; on December 17, in <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>; and shortly after, he settled in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, where many notable Polish soldiers and politicians formed an émigré community. Soon he and some others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. The politicians, grouped around <a href="Ignacy%20Potocki">Ignacy Potocki</a> and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries, including <a href="Ignacy%20Dzia%C5%82y%C5%84ski">Ignacy Działyński</a>. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them, his support was a major boon to them, as he was among the most popular individuals in Poland.

After two weeks in Leipzig, before the second week of January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned uprising in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>—the infighting among different factions, and the growing <a href="reign%20of%20terror">reign of terror</a>.

On January 23, 1793, Prussia and Russia signed the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">Second Partition of Poland</a>. The <a href="Grodno%20Sejm">Grodno Sejm</a>, convened under duress in June, ratified the partition and was also forced to rescind the Constitution of May 3, 1791. With the second partition, Poland became a small country of roughly and a population of some 4 million. This came as a shock to the Targowica Confederates, who had seen themselves as defenders of centuries-old privileges of the magnates, but had hardly expected that their appeal for help to the Tsarina of Russia would further reduce and weaken their country.

In August 1793, Kościuszko, though worried that an uprising would have little chance against the three partitioning powers, returned to Leipzig, where he was met with demands to start planning one as soon as possible. In September he clandestinely crossed the Polish border to conduct personal observations and meet with sympathetic high-ranking officers in the residual Polish Army, including General <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Wodzicki">Józef Wodzicki</a>. The preparations went slowly, and he left for Italy, planning to return in February 1794. However, the situation in Poland was changing rapidly. The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband most of her army, and the reduced units were to be incorporated into the Russian Army. In March, Tsarist agents discovered the revolutionaries in Warsaw and began arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders. Kościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than he had intended and, on March 15, 1794, set off for Kraków.

Learning that the Russian garrison had departed Kraków, Kościuszko entered the city on the night of March 23, 1794. The next morning, in <a href="Main%20Square%2C%20Krak%C3%B3w">the Main Square</a>, he announced an uprising. Kościuszko received the title of "Naczelnik" (commander-in-chief) of Polish–Lithuanian forces fighting against the Russian occupation. He proceeded to mobilize the populace, intending to raise sufficient numbers of volunteers to counteract the larger and more professional Russian Army. He also hoped that neither Austria nor Prussia would intervene, and so discouraged insurgent activity in the Austrian and <a href="Prussian%20Partition">Prussian Partition</a>s.

Kościuszko gathered an army of some 6,000, including 4,000 regular soldiers and 2,000 recruits, and marched on Warsaw. The Russians succeeded in organizing an army to oppose him more quickly than he had expected, but he scored a <a href="Battle%20of%20Rac%C5%82awice">victory at Racławice</a> on April 4, 1794, where he turned the tide by personally leading an infantry charge of peasant volunteers ("<a href="kosynierzy">kosynierzy</a>", scythemen). Nonetheless, this Russian defeat was not strategically significant, and the Russian forces quickly forced Kościuszko to retreat toward Kraków. Near <a href="Po%C5%82aniec">Połaniec</a> he received reinforcements and met with other Uprising leaders (Kołłątaj, Potocki); at Połaniec he issued a major political declaration of the Uprising, the <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Po%C5%82aniec">Proclamation of Połaniec</a>. The declaration stated that serfs were entitled to civil rights and reduced their work obligations (corvée). Meanwhile, the Russians set a <a href="Bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> for Kościuszko's capture, "dead or alive".

By June, the Prussians had begun actively aiding the Russians, and on June 6, 1794, Kościuszko fought a defensive battle against a Prussian-Russian force at <a href="Battle%20of%20Szczekociny">Szczekociny</a>. From late June, for several weeks, he <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Warsaw%20%281794%29">defended Warsaw</a>, controlled by the insurgents. On June 28, a mob of insurgents in Warsaw captured and hanged Bishop <a href="Ignacy%20Massalski">Ignacy Massalski</a> and six others. Kościuszko issued a public reproach, writing, "What happened in Warsaw yesterday filled my heart with bitterness and sorrow", and urging, successfully, that rule of law be followed. By the morning of September 6, the Prussian forces having been withdrawn to suppress an <a href="Greater%20Poland%20Uprising%20%281794%29">uprising underway in Greater Poland</a>, the siege of Warsaw was lifted. On October 10, during a sortie against a new Russian attack, Kościuszko was wounded and captured at <a href="Battle%20of%20Maciejowice">Maciejowice</a>. He was imprisoned by the Russians at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in the <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Fortress">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>. Soon afterward, the uprising ended with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Praga">Battle of Praga</a>, where according to a contemporary Russian witness, the Russians troops massacred 20,000 Warsaw residents. The subsequent <a href="Third%20Partition%20of%20Poland">Third Partition of Poland</a> ended the existence of a sovereign Polish state for the next 123 years.

The death of <a href="Tsaritsa">Tsaritsa</a> <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine the Great</a> on November 17, 1796, led to a change in Russia's policies toward Poland. On November 28, Tsar <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I</a>, who had hated Catherine, pardoned Kościuszko and set him free, after he had tendered an <a href="loyalty%20oath">oath of loyalty</a>. Paul promised to free all Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly <a href="Sybiraks">settled in Siberia</a>. The Tsar gave Kościuszko 12,000 <a href="ruble">ruble</a>s, which the Pole later, in 1798, attempted to return, when also renouncing the oath.

Kościuszko left for the United States, via <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden and London, departing from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> on June 17, 1797, and arriving in Philadelphia on August 18. Though welcomed by the populace, he was viewed with suspicion by the American government, controlled by the <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalists</a>, who distrusted Kościuszko for his previous association with the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican Party</a>.

In March 1798, Kościuszko received a bundle of letters from Europe. The news in one of them came as a shock to him, causing him, still in his wounded condition, to spring from his couch and limp unassisted to the middle of the room and exclaim to General <a href="Anthony%20Walton%20White">Anthony Walton White</a>, "I must return at once to Europe!" The letter in question contained news that Polish General <a href="Jan%20Henryk%20D%C4%85browski">Jan Henryk Dąbrowski</a> and Polish soldiers were fighting in France under Napoleon and that Kościuszko's sister had sent his two nephews in Kościuszko's name to serve in Napoleon's ranks. Around that time Kościuszko also received news that <a href="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a> was seeking Kościuszko's moral and public endorsement for the French fight against one of Poland's partitioners, Prussia. 

The call of family and country drew Kościuszko back to Europe. He immediately consulted then <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President of the United States</a> <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who procured a passport for him under a false name and arranged for his secret departure for France. Kościuszko left no word for either Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, his former comrade-in-arms and fellow St. Petersburg prisoner, or for his own servant, leaving only some money for them.

Other factors contributed to his decision to depart. His French connections meant that he was vulnerable to deportation or imprisonment under the terms of the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>. Jefferson was concerned that the U.S. and France were verging on the brink of war after the <a href="XYZ%20Affair">XYZ Affair</a> and regarded him as an informal envoy. Kościuszko later wrote, "Jefferson considered that I would be the most effective intermediary in bringing an accord with France, so I accepted the mission even if without any official authorization."

Before Kościuszko left for France, he collected his back pay, wrote a will, and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor. Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded for twenty years in a spirit of mutual admiration. Jefferson wrote that "He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." In the will, Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black <a href="slaves">slaves</a>, including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work. 

Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded an inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest. It was tied up in the courts until 1856. Jefferson recommended his friend <a href="John%20Hartwell%20Cocke">John Hartwell Cocke</a>, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest. 

The case of Kościuszko's American estate reached the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> three times. Kościuszko had made four wills, three of which postdated the American one. 

None of the money that Kościuszko had earmarked for the <a href="manumission">manumission</a> and education of <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> in the United States was ever used for that purpose. Though the American will was never carried out as defined, its legacy was used to found an educational institute at <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, in 1826, for African Americans in the United States. It was named for Kościuszko.

Kościuszko arrived in <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, France, on June 28, 1798. By that time, Talleyrand's plans had changed and no longer included him. Kościuszko remained politically active in Polish émigré circles in France, and on August 7, 1799, he joined the <a href="Society%20of%20Polish%20Republicans">Society of Polish Republicans</a> ("Towarzystwo Republikanów Polskich"). Kościuszko, however, refused the offered command of <a href="Polish%20Legions%20in%20Italy">Polish Legions</a> being formed for service with France. On October 17 and November 6, 1799, he met with <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>; however, he failed to reach an agreement with the French general, who regarded Kościuszko as a "fool" who "overestimated his influence" in Poland. Kościuszko, for his part, disliked Napoleon for his dictatorial aspirations and called him the "undertaker of the [French] Republic". In 1807, Kościuszko settled in château de Berville, near <a href="La%20Genevraye">La Genevraye</a>, distancing himself from politics.

Kościuszko did not believe that Napoleon would restore Poland in any durable form. When Napoleon's forces approached the borders of Poland, Kościuszko wrote him a letter, demanding guarantees of <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> and substantial national borders, which Napoleon ignored. Kościuszko concluded that Napoleon had created the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a> in 1807 only as an expedient, not because he supported Polish sovereignty. Consequently, Kościuszko did not move to the Duchy of Warsaw or join the new <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Warsaw">Army of the Duchy</a>, allied with Napoleon.

Instead, after the fall of Napoleon, he met with Russia's Tsar <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I</a>, in Paris and then in <a href="Braunau%2C%20Switzerland">Braunau, Switzerland</a>. The Tsar hoped that Kościuszko could be convinced to return to Poland, where the Tsar planned to create a new, Russian-allied Polish state (the <a href="Congress%20Kingdom">Congress Kingdom</a>). In return for his prospective services, Kościuszko demanded social reforms and restoration of territory, which he wished would reach the <a href="Daugava%20River">Dvina</a> and <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper River</a>s in the east. However, soon afterward, in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Kościuszko learned that the <a href="Congress%20Poland">Kingdom of Poland</a> to be created by the Tsar would be even smaller than the earlier Duchy of Warsaw. Kościuszko called such an entity "a joke". When he received no reply to his letters to the Tsar, he left Vienna and moved to <a href="Solothurn">Solothurn</a>, Switzerland.

On April 2, 1817, Kościuszko emancipated the peasants in his remaining lands in Poland, but Tsar Alexander disallowed this. Suffering from poor health and old wounds, on October 15, 1817, Kościuszko died in Solothurn at age 71 after falling from a horse, developing a fever, and suffering a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> a few days later.

Kościuszko's first funeral was held on October 19, 1817, at a formerly Jesuit church in Solothurn. As news of his death spread, masses and memorial services were held in <a href="partitioned%20Poland">partitioned Poland</a>. His <a href="embalming">embalmed</a> body was deposited in a <a href="crypt">crypt</a> of the Solothurn church. In 1818, Kościuszko's body was transferred to Kraków, arriving at <a href="St.%20Florian%27s%20Church">St. Florian's Church</a> on April 11, 1818. On June 22, 1818, or June 23, 1819 (accounts vary), to the tolling of the <a href="Sigismund%20Bell">Sigismund Bell</a> and the firing of cannon, it was placed in a crypt at <a href="Wawel%20Cathedral">Wawel Cathedral</a>, a <a href="Pantheon%20%28gods%29">pantheon</a> of Polish kings and <a href="Folk%20hero">national heroes</a>.

Kościuszko's <a href="Organ%20%28anatomy%29">internal organs</a>, which had been removed during embalming, were separately interred in a graveyard at <a href="Zuchwil">Zuchwil</a>, near Solothurn. Kościuszko's organs remain there to this day; a large memorial stone was erected in 1820, next to a Polish memorial chapel. His <a href="Human%20heart">heart</a>, however, was not interred with the other organs, but instead kept in an <a href="urn">urn</a> at the <a href="Polish%20Museum%2C%20Rapperswil">Polish Museum</a> in <a href="Rapperswil">Rapperswil</a>, Switzerland. The heart, along with the rest of the Museum's holdings, were repatriated back to <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> in 1927, where the heart now reposes in a chapel at the <a href="Royal%20Castle%2C%20Warsaw">Royal Castle</a>.

The Polish historian <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Herbst">Stanisław Herbst</a> states in the 1967 "<a href="Polish%20Biographical%20Dictionary">Polish Biographical Dictionary</a>" that Kościuszko may be Poland's and the world's most popular Pole ever. There are monuments to him around the world, beginning with the <a href="Ko%C5%9Bciuszko%20Mound">Kościuszko Mound</a> at Kraków, erected in 1820–23 by men, women, and children bringing earth from the battlefields where he had fought. The <a href="Thaddeus%20Kosciusko%20Bridge">Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge</a>, a twin bridge structure across the <a href="Mohawk%20River">Mohawk River</a> in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>, completed in 1959, and the <a href="Kosciuszko%20Bridge">Kosciuszko Bridge</a>, built in 1939 in New York City, were named in Kościuszko's honor. The New York City bridge was partially replaced in 2017 by a new bridge of the same name, with an additional bridge scheduled to open in 2020.

El Greco

Doménikos Theotokópoulos ( ; October 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco ("The Greek"), was a painter, <a href="sculpture">sculptor</a> and <a href="architecture">architect</a> of the <a href="Spanish%20Renaissance">Spanish Renaissance</a>. "El Greco" was a nickname, a reference to his <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek letters</a>, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, "Doménikos Theotokópoulos", often adding the word Κρής "Krēs", <a href="Cretan">Cretan</a>.

El Greco was born in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Candia">Kingdom of Candia</a>, which was at that time part of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>, and the center of <a href="Post-Byzantine%20art">Post-Byzantine art</a>. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> and of the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Venetian Renaissance</a> taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>. In 1577, he moved to <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo, Spain</a>, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.

El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a> and <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> and <a href="Nikos%20Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical <a href="pigmentation">pigmentation</a>, marrying <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> traditions with those of <a href="Western%20painting">Western painting</a>.

Born in 1541, in either the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>) on <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had probably been driven out of <a href="Chania">Chania</a> to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a> between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and <a href="tax%20collector">tax collector</a>. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also <a href="Greeks">Greek</a>. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531 – 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.

El Greco received his initial training as an <a href="icon">icon</a> painter of the <a href="Cretan%20school">Cretan school</a>, a leading center of post-Byzantine art. In addition to painting, he probably studied the <a href="classics">classics</a> of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, and perhaps the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> classics also; he left a "working library" of 130 volumes at his death, including the Bible in Greek and an annotated <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a> book. Candia was a center for artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co-existed harmoniously, where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century, and had organized a <a href="painters%27%20guild">painters' guild</a>, based on the Italian model. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a "master" ("maestro Domenigo"), meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop. Three years later, in June 1566, as a witness to a contract, he signed his name in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> as ("Master Ménegos Theotokópoulos, painter").

Most scholars believe that the Theotokópoulos "family was almost certainly <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a>", although some Catholic sources still claim him from birth. Like many <a href="Byzantine%20scholars%20in%20the%20Renaissance">Orthodox emigrants</a> to Catholic areas of Europe, some assert that he may have transferred to Catholicism after his arrival, and possibly practiced as a Catholic in Spain, where he described himself as a "devout Catholic" in his will. The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos Panayotakis, <a href="Pandelis%20Prevelakis">Pandelis Prevelakis</a> and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates strongly that El Greco's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox. One of his uncles was an Orthodox priest, and his name is not mentioned in the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete. Prevelakis goes even further, expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a practicing Roman Catholic.

Important for his early biography, El Greco, still in Crete, painted his "<a href="Dormition%20of%20the%20Virgin%20%28El%20Greco%29">Dormition of the Virgin</a>" near the end of his Cretan period, probably before 1567. Three other signed works of "Doménicos" are attributed to El Greco ("<a href="Modena%20Triptych">Modena Triptych</a>", "St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child", and "<a href="The%20Adoration%20of%20the%20Magi">The Adoration of the Magi</a>"). In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was already an enrolled master of the local guild, presumably in charge of his own workshop. He left for Venice a few years later, and never returned to Crete. His "Dormition of the Virgin", of before 1567 in <a href="tempera">tempera</a> and gold on panel was probably created near the end of El Greco's Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian <a href="Mannerist">Mannerist</a> stylistic and iconographic elements, and incorporates stylistic elements of the <a href="Cretan%20School">Cretan School</a>.

It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice, Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211. Though the exact year is not clear, most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567. Knowledge of El Greco's years in Italy is limited. He lived in Venice until 1570 and, according to a letter written by his much older friend, the greatest miniaturist of the age, <a href="Giulio%20Clovio">Giulio Clovio</a>, was a "disciple" of <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous. This may mean he worked in Titian's large studio, or not. Clovio characterized El Greco as "a rare talent in painting".

In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c. 1575–76) before he left for Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the <a href="Palazzo%20Farnese">Palazzo Farnese</a>, which <a href="Alessandro%20Farnese%20%28cardinal%29">Cardinal Alessandro Farnese</a> had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar <a href="Fulvio%20Orsini">Fulvio Orsini</a>, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist ("View of <a href="Mount%20Sinai">Mt. Sinai</a>" and a portrait of Clovio are among them).

Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter. His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a> and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian. The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light. Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco was sitting in a darkened room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his "inner light". As a result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such as violent <a href="perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a> vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism.

By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> and <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a> and <a href="Parmigianino">Parmigianino</a> for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's "Last Judgment" in the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>; he extended an offer to <a href="Pope%20Pius%20V">Pope Pius V</a> to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that "he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the "Allegory of the Holy League". By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works ("The Purification of the Temple"), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century "Chronicles", <a href="Giulio%20Mancini">Giulio Mancini</a> included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.

Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer <a href="Pirro%20Ligorio">Pirro Ligorio</a> called him a "foolish foreigner", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">Guild of Saint Luke</a> in Rome as a <a href="Portrait%20miniature">miniature</a> painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and hired as assistants the painters Lattanzio Bonastri de Lucignano and Francisco Preboste.

In 1577, El Greco migrated to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works. At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city with "an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future". In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain <a href="art%20criticism">art critics</a>. During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a> was still under construction and <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Veronese</a> and <a href="Anthonis%20Mor">Anthonis Mor</a> all refused to come to Spain. Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Navarrete">Juan Fernández de Navarrete</a>, of whose "gravedad y decoro" ("seriousness and decorum") the king approved. However, Fernández died in 1579; the moment should have been ideal for El Greco.

Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met <a href="Benito%20Arias%20Montano">Benito Arias Montano</a>, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; <a href="Pedro%20Chac%C3%B3n">Pedro Chacón</a>, a clergyman; and <a href="Luis%20de%20Castilla">Luis de Castilla</a>, son of <a href="Diego%20de%20Castilla">Diego de Castilla</a>, the dean of the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Toledo">Cathedral of Toledo</a>. El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Saint%20Dominic%20of%20Silos%20%28the%20Old%29">church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo</a> in Toledo and for the renowned . By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including "The Trinity" and "The Assumption of the Virgin". These works would establish the painter's reputation in Toledo.

El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: "Allegory of the Holy League" and "Martyrdom of <a href="Saint%20Maurice">St. Maurice</a>". However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the <a href="chapter-house">chapter-house</a> rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by <a href="Benvenuto%20Cellini">Benvenuto Cellini</a> also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with <a href="Federico%20Zuccari">Federico Zuccari</a> was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.

Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter. According to <a href="Hortensio%20F%C3%A9lix%20Paravicino">Hortensio Félix Paravicino</a>, a 17th-century Spanish preacher and poet, "Crete gave him life and the painter's craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through Death he began to achieve eternal life." In 1585, he appears to have hired an assistant, <a href="List%20of%20Italian%20painters">Italian painter</a> Francisco Preboste, and to have established a workshop capable of producing <a href="altar">altar</a> frames and statues as well as paintings. On 12 March 1586 he obtained the commission for "<a href="The%20Burial%20of%20the%20Count%20of%20Orgaz">The Burial of the Count of Orgaz</a>", now his best-known work.

The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of intense activity for El Greco. During these years he received several major commissions, and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural ensembles for a variety of religious institutions. Among his major commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San José in Toledo (1597–1599); three paintings (1596–1600) for the Colegio de Doña María de Aragon, an <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian</a> monastery in Madrid, and the high altar, four lateral altars, and the painting "St. Ildefonso" for the Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad (Hospital of Charity) at <a href="Illescas%2C%20Toledo">Illescas</a> (1603–1605). The minutes of the commission of "<a href="The%20Immaculate%20Conception%20Paintings%20by%20El%20Greco">The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception</a>" (1607–1613), which were composed by the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as "one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it".

Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture; this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life. In 1608, he received his last major commission: for the Hospital of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">Saint John the Baptist</a> in Toledo.

El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving contracts mention him as the tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Villena">Marquis de Villena</a>. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed the rest of his life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, <a href="Jorge%20Manuel%20Theotoc%C3%B3puli">Jorge Manuel</a>, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.

During the course of the execution of a commission for the <a href="Hospital%20de%20Tavera">Hospital de Tavera</a>, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on 7 April 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this <a href="will%20%28law%29">last will and testament</a> (El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.

The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.

El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over form. <a href="Francisco%20Pacheco">Francisco Pacheco</a>, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked "the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity" and that "he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".

Art historian <a href="Max%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Max Dvořák</a> was the first scholar to connect El Greco's art with Mannerism and <a href="Antinaturalism%20%28sociology%29">Antinaturalism</a>. Modern scholars characterize El Greco's theory as "typically Mannerist" and pinpoint its sources in the <a href="Platonism%20in%20the%20Renaissance">Neoplatonism of the Renaissance</a>. Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art; according to <a href="Nicholas%20Penny">Nicholas Penny</a> "once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a style of his own—one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting".

In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for "<a href="The%20Immaculate%20Conception%20Paintings%20by%20El%20Greco">The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception</a>" El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a> and <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>.

Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light. As Jonathan Brown notes, "each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source". Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying <a href="Neoplatonism%20and%20Christianity">Christian Neo-Platonism</a>.

Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings. <a href="Harold%20Wethey">Harold Wethey</a> asserts that "although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>". He believes that in El Greco's mature works "the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation".

El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character. His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality. Wethey says that "by such simple means, the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist, along with <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>".

El Greco painted many of his paintings on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual <a href="pigments">pigments</a> of his period such as <a href="azurite">azurite</a>, <a href="lead-tin-yellow">lead-tin-yellow</a>, <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, <a href="madder%20lake">madder lake</a>, <a href="ochres">ochres</a> and <a href="red%20lead">red lead</a>, but he seldom used the expensive natural <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.

The discovery of the "<a href="Dormition%20of%20the%20Virgin%20%28El%20Greco%29">Dormition of the Virgin</a>" on <a href="Syros">Syros</a>, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox <a href="Dormition%20of%20the%20Virgin">Dormition of the Virgin</a> and the Catholic <a href="Assumption%20of%20the%20Virgin">Assumption of the Virgin</a>. Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism. Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art. According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka "far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work". In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> professors <a href="Cyril%20Mango">Cyril Mango</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Jeffreys">Elizabeth Jeffreys</a>, who assert that "despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his <a href="Works%20of%20El%20Greco">famous paintings</a> was his signature in Greek lettering". Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is "neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the <a href="Art%20of%20Italy">Italian art</a>, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art".

The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a> and ancient <a href="Neo-Platonism">Neo-Platonism</a>, the works of <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a> and <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style. Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, Madrid, concludes that the presence of "Byzantine memories" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.

El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime. He usually designed complete altar compositions, working as architect and sculptor as well as painter—at, for instance, the Hospital de la Caridad. There he decorated the chapel of the hospital, but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished. For the master designed the original altar of <a href="gilding">gilded</a> wood which has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the "Miracle of St. Ildefonso" still survives on the lower center of the frame.

His most important architectural achievement was the church and Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, for which he also executed sculptures and paintings. El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting. He is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo. Pacheco characterized him as "a writer of painting, sculpture and architecture".

In the <a href="marginalia">marginalia</a> that El Greco inscribed in his copy of <a href="Daniele%20Barbaro">Daniele Barbaro</a>'s translation of <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.

El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early <a href="baroque">baroque</a> style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Some of these commentators, such as <a href="Antonio%20Palomino">Antonio Palomino</a> and <a href="Juan%20Agust%C3%ADn%20Ce%C3%A1n%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez</a>, described his mature work as "contemptible", "ridiculous" and "worthy of scorn". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish <a href="historiography">historiography</a>, adorned with terms such as "strange", "queer", "original", "eccentric" and "odd". The phrase "sunk in eccentricity", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into "madness".

With the arrival of <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a>, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal <a href="romantic%20hero">romantic hero</a> (the "gifted", the "misunderstood", the "mad"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics <a href="Zacharie%20Astruc">Zacharie Astruc</a> and <a href="Paul%20Lefort">Paul Lefort</a> helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who "painted horrors in the Escorial" in the words of <a href="Ephraim%20Chambers">Ephraim Chambers</a>' "<a href="Cyclopaedia%2C%20or%20Universal%20Dictionary%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Cyclopaedia</a>" in 1899.

In 1908, Spanish art historian <a href="Manuel%20Bartolom%C3%A9%20Coss%C3%ADo">Manuel Bartolomé Cossío</a> published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School. The same year <a href="Julius%20Meier-Graefe">Julius Meier-Graefe</a>, a scholar of French <a href="Impressionism">Impressionism</a>, traveled in Spain, expecting to study Velásquez, but instead becoming fascinated by El Greco; he recorded his experiences in "Spanische Reise" ("Spanish Journey", published in English in 1926), the book which widely established El Greco as a great painter of the past "outside a somewhat narrow circle". In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity. These are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco's impact on the <a href="art%20movement">artistic movements</a> of his time:

To the English artist and critic <a href="Roger%20Fry">Roger Fry</a> in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best "with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public". Fry described El Greco as "an <a href="Old%20Master">old master</a> who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way".

During the same period, other researchers developed alternative, more radical theories. The ophthalmologists August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive <a href="astigmatism">astigmatism</a> or <a href="strabismus">strabismus</a>) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular; the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a>. Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", stated that "to Greeks [El Greco] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard".

As was proved by the campaign of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28Athens%29">National Art Gallery in Athens</a> to raise the funds for the purchase of "Saint Peter" in 1995, El Greco is loved not just by experts and art lovers but also by ordinary people; thanks to the donations mainly of individuals and public benefit foundations the National Art Gallery raised 1.2 million dollars and purchased the painting. Epitomizing the consensus of El Greco's impact, <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, the 39th President of the United States, said in April 1980 that El Greco was "the most extraordinary painter that ever came along back then" and that he was "maybe three or four centuries ahead of his time".

El Greco's re-evaluation was not limited to scholars. According to Efi Foundoulaki, "painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century 'discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves". His expressiveness and colors influenced <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a> and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a>. To the <a href="Blaue%20Reiter">Blaue Reiter</a> group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that "mystical inner construction" that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>, one of the forerunners of <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and (in appearance only) unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them". Fry observed that Cézanne drew from "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".

The <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolists</a>, and <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> during his <a href="Blue%20Period">Blue Period</a>, drew on the cold tonality of El Greco, utilizing the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on his <a href="Proto-Cubism">Proto-Cubist</a> , he visited his friend <a href="Ignacio%20Zuloaga">Ignacio Zuloaga</a> in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's "<a href="Opening%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Seal">Opening of the Fifth Seal</a>" (owned by Zuloaga since 1897). The relation between and the "Opening of the Fifth Seal" was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed.

The early Cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights. Several traits of cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco's work. According to Picasso, El Greco's structure is Cubist. On 22 February 1950, Picasso began his series of "paraphrases" of other painters' works with "The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco". Foundoulaki asserts that Picasso "completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by Cézanne".

The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco. According to <a href="Franz%20Marc">Franz Marc</a>, one of the principal painters of the <a href="German%20Expressionism">German expressionist</a> movement, "we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art". <a href="Jackson%20Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a>, a major force in the <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionist</a> movement, was also influenced by El Greco. By 1943, Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master.

Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco's art. <a href="Kysa%20Johnson">Kysa Johnson</a> used El Greco's paintings of the <a href="Immaculate%20Conception">Immaculate Conception</a> as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.

El Greco's personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems ("Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II.", 1913) was based directly on El Greco's "<a href="The%20Immaculate%20Conception%20Paintings%20by%20El%20Greco">Immaculate Conception</a>". Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography "Report to Greco" and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.

In 1998, the Greek electronic composer and artist <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a> published "<a href="El%20Greco%20%28album%29">El Greco</a>", a <a href="symphony">symphonic</a> album inspired by the artist. This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis, ("A Tribute to El Greco", ). The life of the Cretan-born artist is the subject of the film "<a href="El%20Greco%20%282007%20film%29">El Greco</a>" of Greek, Spanish and British production. Directed by <a href="Yannis%20Smaragdis">Ioannis Smaragdis</a>, the film began shooting in October 2006 on the island of Crete and debuted on the screen one year later; British actor <a href="Nick%20Ashdon">Nick Ashdon</a> was cast to play El Greco.

The exact number of El Greco's works has been a hotly contested issue. In 1937, a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco. Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small <a href="triptych">triptych</a> in the <a href="Galleria%20Estense">Galleria Estense</a> at <a href="Modena">Modena</a> on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych ("", Created by the hand of Doménikos). There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist. Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue with a greatly reduced corpus of materials. Whereas art historian José Camón Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor Sœhner, a German researcher of <a href="Spanish%20art">Spanish art</a>, recognized only 137. Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco's .

Since 1962, the discovery of the "Dormition" and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and . The discovery of the "Dormition" led to the attribution of three other signed works of "Doménicos" to El Greco ("Modena Triptych", "St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child", and "The Adoration of the Magi") and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic—some signed, some not (such as "The Passion of Christ (Pietà with Angels)" painted in 1566),—which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate his early style, some painted while he was still on Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome. Even Wethey accepted that "he [El Greco] probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete". Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey's catalogue is at the center of these disagreements.

A few sculptures, including "Epimetheus and Pandora", have been attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, "The Crucifixion".

a. Theotokópoulos acquired the name "El Greco" in Italy, where the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of origin was a common practice. The curious form of the article ("El") may be from the Venetian dialect or more likely from the Spanish, though in Spanish his name would be "". The Cretan master was generally known in Italy and Spain as "Dominico Greco", and was called only after his death El Greco ().

b. According to a contemporary, El Greco acquired his name, not only for his place of origin, but also for the sublimity of his art: "Out of the great esteem he was held in he was called the Greek (il Greco)" (comment of Giulio Cesare Mancini about El Greco in his "Chronicles", which were written a few years after El Greco's death).

c. There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace. Most researchers and scholars give Candia as his birthplace. Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old Fodele was (the village later changed location because of pirate raids). Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele.

d. This document comes from the notarial archives of Candia and was published in 1962. "Menegos" is the Venetian dialect form of , and (=) is a Greek term for painter.

e. The arguments of these Catholic sources are based on the lack of Orthodox archival <a href="baptism">baptism</a>al records on Crete and on a relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites during El Greco's youth. Based on the assessment that his art reflects the religious spirit of <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Roman Catholic Spain</a>, and on a reference in his last will and testament, where he described himself as a "devout Catholic", some scholars assume that El Greco was part of the vibrant Catholic Cretan minority or that he converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism before leaving the island.

f. According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On 26 December 1566 El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a "panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background" ("un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato") in a lottery. The Byzantine icon by young Doménicos depicting the "Passion of Christ", painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on 27 December 1566 in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period. Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after 27 December 1566. In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that El Greco left Crete in 1567. According to other archival material—drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan <a href="cartographer">cartographer</a>—he was in Venice by 1568.

g. Mancini reports that El Greco said to the Pope that if the whole work was demolished he himself would do it in a decent manner and with seemliness.

h. Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was 62,000.

i. El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on 18 June 1603. He agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict. He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the appraisers. The brotherhood took advantage of this act of good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement. Finally, El Greco assigned his legal representation to Preboste and a friend of him, Francisco Ximénez Montero, and accepted a payment of 2,093 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s.

j. Doña Jerónima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco, and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment.

k. The myth of El Greco's madness came in two versions. On the one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity. On the other hand, the public and the critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would retain the image of El Greco as a "mad painter" and, therefore, his "maddest" paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his "madness".

l. This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a> David Kuntz. Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate. Stuart Anstis, Professor at the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> (Department of Psychology), concludes that "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom." According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, "astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce".

Calgary Stampede

The Calgary Stampede is an annual <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>, <a href="fair">exhibition</a>, and <a href="festival">festival</a> held every July in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada. The ten-day event, which bills itself as "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth", attracts over one million visitors per year and features one of the world's largest rodeos, a <a href="parade">parade</a>, <a href="Midway%20%28fair%29">midway</a>, <a href="stage%20show">stage show</a>s, <a href="concert">concert</a>s, agricultural competitions, <a href="chuckwagon%20racing">chuckwagon racing</a>, and <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> exhibitions. In 2008, the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the <a href="ProRodeo%20Hall%20of%20Fame">ProRodeo Hall of Fame</a>.

The event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. In 1912, American promoter <a href="Guy%20Weadick">Guy Weadick</a> organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.

Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city. Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada. However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.

Calgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the "Stampede City", carries the informal nickname of "Cowtown," and the local <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> team is called the <a href="Calgary%20Stampeders">Stampeders</a>. The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don <a href="western%20wear">western wear</a>, and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a>s.

The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first <a href="fair">fair</a> two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents. By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the <a href="Elbow%20River">Elbow River</a> to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather, and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895. The land passed briefly to future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> who sold it to the city. The area was called <a href="Beltline%2C%20Calgary">Victoria Park</a>, after <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.

The exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded <a href="Dominion%20Exhibition">Dominion Exhibition</a> that year. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack. It held a lavish parade as well as <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>, horse racing, and <a href="trick%20roping">trick roping</a> competitions as part of the event. The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.

<a href="Guy%20Weadick">Guy Weadick</a>, an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the <a href="Miller%20Brothers%20101%20Ranch">Miller Brothers 101 Ranch</a> Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the "wild west" than the shows he was a part of. He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans, but with the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen <a href="Patrick%20Burns%20%28politician%29">Pat Burns</a>, <a href="George%20Lane%20%28politician%29">George Lane</a>, <a href="Archie%20McLean%20%28politician%29">A. J. McLean</a>, and <a href="A.%20E.%20Cross">A. E. Cross</a> to put up $100,000 to guarantee funding for the event. The <a href="Big%20Four%20%28Calgary%29">Big Four</a>, as they came to be known, viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen. The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100,000 people attended the six-day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States, and Mexico compete for $20,000 in prizes. The event generated $120,000 in revenue and was hailed as a success.

Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America. However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event. Businessmen in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially. A third attempt held in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> State in 1916 suffered the same fate. Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of <a href="E.%20L.%20Richardson">E. L. Richardson</a>, the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the "Great Victory Stampede" in celebration of Canada's soldiers returning from World War I.

While the 1919 Stampede was successful, it was again held as a one-time event. Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting. Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis. Weadick agreed, and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.
The combined event was first held in 1923. Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the "wild west". Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor <a href="George%20Harry%20Webster">George Webster</a> followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties. The new sport of <a href="chuckwagon%20racing">chuckwagon racing</a> was introduced and proved immediately popular. 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit. Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.

Attendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick. Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event. The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely. One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties. Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal. His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees. Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.

At least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950. The most profitable, the 1925 <a href="silent%20movie">silent film</a> "The Calgary Stampede", used footage from the rodeo and exposed people across North America to the event. <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> stars and foreign dignitaries were attracted to the Stampede; <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> each served as parade marshals during the 1950s, while Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> and Prince <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Philip</a> made their first of two visits to the event as part of their 1959 tour of Canada. The Queen also opened the 1973 Stampede.

The discovery of the <a href="Leduc%20No.%201">Leduc No. 1</a> oil well in 1946 and major reserves in the <a href="Turner%20Valley%2C%20Alberta">Turner Valley</a> area southwest of the city ushered in a period of growth and prosperity. Calgary was transformed from an agricultural community into the oil and gas capital of Canada. The city's population nearly doubled between 1949 and 1956, and Calgary's immigrant population not only embraced the Stampede, but encouraged friends and family in their home towns to do the same. The 1950s represented the golden age of the Calgary Stampede.

Attendance records were broken nearly every year in the 1950s and overall attendance increased by 200,000 from 1949 to 1959. The growth necessitated expansion of the exhibition grounds. The 7,500-seat <a href="Stampede%20Corral">Stampede Corral</a> was completed in 1950 as the largest indoor arena in Western Canada. It housed the <a href="Calgary%20Stampeders%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Calgary Stampeders</a> hockey team, which was operated by the Board of Governors and won the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League%20%28minor%20pro%29">Western Hockey League</a> championship in 1954. Acts such as the <a href="Minnesota%20Orchestra">Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> played the Corral, although the arena's poor acoustics were a frequent concern to organizers and patrons.

Improvements were made to the grandstand and the race track was rebuilt in 1954. The Big Four Building, named in honour of the Stampede's benefactors, opened in 1959 to serve as the city's largest exhibition hall in the summer, and was converted into a 24-sheet <a href="curling">curling</a> facility each winter. The improvements failed to alleviate all the pressures growth had caused: chronic parking shortages and inability to accommodate demand for tickets to the rodeo and grandstand shows continued.

Attendance continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, topping 500,000 for the first time in 1962 and reaching 654,000 in 1966. Organizers expanded the event from six days to nine in 1967 and then to ten the following year. The Stampede exceeded one million visitors for the first time in 1976. The park, meanwhile, continued to grow. The Round-Up Centre opened in 1979 as the new exhibition hall, and the <a href="Olympic%20Saddledome">Olympic Saddledome</a> was completed in 1983. The Saddledome replaced the Corral as the city's top sporting arena, and both facilities hosted <a href="ice%20hockey%20at%20the%201988%20Winter%20Olympics">hockey</a> and <a href="figure%20skating%20at%20the%201988%20Winter%20Olympics">figure skating</a> events at the <a href="1988%20Winter%20Olympics">1988 Winter Olympics</a>.

Maintaining the traditional focus on agriculture and western heritage remained a priority for the Calgary Stampede as the city grew into a major financial and oil hub in Western Canada. "Aggie Days", a program designed to introduce urban schoolchildren to agriculture was introduced in 1989 and proved immediately popular. A ten-year expansion plan called Horizon 2000 was released in 1990 detailing plans to grow Stampede Park into a year-round destination for Calgarians; an updated plan was released in 2004. The organization dropped the word "exhibition" from its title in 2007, and has since been known simply as the Calgary Stampede. Attendance has plateaued around 1.2 million since 2000, however the Stampede set an attendance record of 1,409,371 while celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2012.

<a href="2013%20Alberta%20floods">Severe flooding</a> in Calgary two weeks before the July 5 opening of the 2013 Stampede caused significant damage to the grounds. Stampede officials promised, however, that the event would be staged as planned. Some of the main events, and all concerts, scheduled for the Saddledome were cancelled due to flood damage to the facility, while other events were relocated to other locations.

The parade serves as the official opening of the Stampede and begins shortly before 9 a.m. on the first Friday of the event. Each year features a different parade marshal, chosen to reflect the public's interests at that time. Politicians, athletes, actors and other dignitaries have all served as marshals. The event features dozens of marching bands, over 150 floats and hundreds of horses with entrants from around the world, and combines western themes with modern ones. Cowboys, First Nations dancers and members of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> in their red serges are joined by clowns, bands, politicians and business leaders. The first Stampede parade, held in 1912, was attended by 75,000 people, greater than the city's population at the time. As many as 350,000 people attended the parade in 2009, while the presence of <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William</a> and <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Catherine</a>, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, at the 2011 parade as part of their <a href="2011%20royal%20tour%20of%20Canada">tour of Canada</a> increased attendance to a record estimate of 425,000.

The rodeo is the heart of the Calgary Stampede. It is one of the largest, and the most famous event of its kind in the world. With a prize of $100,000 to the winner of each major discipline and $1,000,000 total on championship day alone, it also offers the richest payout. Cowboys consider performing in front of over 20,000 fans daily to be the highlight of the rodeo season.

There are six major disciplines – <a href="bull%20riding">bull riding</a>, <a href="barrel%20racing">barrel racing</a>, <a href="steer%20wrestling">steer wrestling</a>, <a href="calf%20roping">tie down roping</a>, <a href="saddle%20bronc%20and%20bareback%20riding">saddle bronc and bareback riding</a> – and four novice events – junior <a href="steer%20riding">steer riding</a>, novice bareback, novice saddle bronc and wild pony racing. Each event is organized as its own tournament, and the cowboys and girls are divided into two pools. The first pool competes each night for the first four nights, and the second each night for four nights following. The top four in each pool advance to the Sunday final, and the remainder compete on Saturday for a wild card spot in the final. The competitor with the best time or score on Sunday wins the $100,000 grand prize.

Most livestock for the rodeo events come from the Stampede Ranch located near the town of <a href="Hanna%2C%20Alberta">Hanna</a>. The ranch was created in 1961 as a means of improving the quality of bucking horses and bulls and to guarantee supply. The first of its kind in North America, the Stampede Ranch operates a breeding program that produces some of the top rodeo stock in the world and supplies rodeos throughout southern Alberta, and as far south as <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>.

Weadick is credited with inventing the sport of <a href="chuckwagon%20racing">chuckwagon racing</a> in 1923, inspired either by seeing a similar event in 1922 at the <a href="Gleichen%2C%20Alberta">Gleichen Stampede</a> or watching impromptu races as he grew up. He devised the sport to be a new and exciting event for the newly joined Exhibition and Stampede. Weadick invited ranchers to enter their wagons and crews to compete for a total of $275 in prize money.

Called the Rangeland Derby, and nicknamed the "half-mile of hell", chuckwagon racing proved immediately popular and quickly became the event's largest attraction. While only six teams raced in 1923, today's Rangeland Derby consists of 36 teams competing for $1.15 million in prize money. <a href="Joe%20Carbury">Joe Carbury</a> was the voice of the Rangeland Derby for 45 years, until 2008. His distinctive voice and signature phrase of "and they're offfffffff!" to announce the start of a race made him a local legend, and earned him induction into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

The chuckwagon drivers auction advertising space on their wagons before each year's Stampede. The first advertisement on the tarp cover of a chuckwagon was made in 1941, and Lloyd Nelson was the last person to win the Rangeland Derby without a sponsored wagon, doing so in 1956. The current practice of selling advertising via a tarp auction began in 1979. The revenue generated by the auctions, a record $4 million for the 2012 Stampede, is considered an indicator of the strength of Calgary's economy.

When the agricultural exhibition was first launched in 1886, Alberta was an overwhelmingly rural province. Today, agricultural producers make up less than two percent of the province's population, but the exhibition remains an integral part of the Calgary Stampede. Nearly half of all visitors attend the exhibition, which is made up of 50 agricultural programs organized by more than 1,000 exhibitors. Numerous competitions are held as part of the exhibition. The American <a href="National%20Cutting%20Horse%20Association">National Cutting Horse Association</a> sanctions a World Series of <a href="Cutting%20%28sport%29">Cutting</a> event, and the World Championship Blacksmith Competition attracts top <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>s from around the world. Farm and ranch demonstrations feature numerous breeds of livestock along with <a href="Herding%20dog">stock dog</a> trials and <a href="team%20penning">team penning</a> competitions.

Additionally, the exhibition serves to educate the public about Alberta's ranching and agricultural heritage along with modern food production displays through events like Ag-tivity in the City. The Stampede works with Alberta <a href="4-H">4-H</a> clubs to encourage youth participation in agricultural pursuits, and has a partnership with <a href="Olds%20College">Olds College</a> that includes the operation of a satellite campus at Stampede Park.

The Calgary Stampede <a href="carnival">midway</a> has been operated by North American Midway Entertainment, and its predecessor <a href="Conklin%20Shows">Conklin Shows</a>, since 1976. The midway is the only part of the event operated on a for-profit basis. It is considered an essential component of the Stampede, but is separate from the predominantly western theme. The midway opens on the Thursday night before other events begin, known as "sneak-a-peek" night. In addition to the traditional rides and carnival games, the midway features two concert areas. Nashville North, a large party tent, made its debut in 1993 as a <a href="country%20music">country music</a> venue. It was followed one-year later by what is now known as the <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> Stage that offers family entertainment during the day and <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> and <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> acts during the evenings. The Saddledome hosts headlining acts, including <a href="Garth%20Brooks">Garth Brooks</a> and <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>, who were booked for the Stampede's 100th anniversary in 2012.

The Stampede Market is located in the <a href="Bank%20of%20Montreal">BMO</a> Centre on the northwest corner of the park. It offers of retail space and in 2011 had 181 vendors selling artwork, toys, household goods, foodstuffs and other items. The Western Oasis, a subsection of the market, offers cowboy and western-themed artwork, bronze statues, craftwork, foods and wine. Lured by the opportunity to show their wares to the one million people who attend the Stampede, some vendors wait years before gaining admittance, and those that do consider it one of the prime events of the year.

Stampede Park is located southeast of <a href="Downtown%20Calgary">Downtown Calgary</a> in the <a href="Beltline%2C%20Calgary">Beltline District</a> and is serviced by <a href="Calgary%20Transit">Calgary Transit</a>'s <a href="C-Train">light rail system</a>. Permanent structures at the site include the Saddledome and Corral, Big Four Building, <a href="BMO%20Centre">BMO Centre</a> – a convention and exhibition facility – a casino, the <a href="Stampede%20Grandstand">Stampede Grandstand</a>, the agriculture building, and a number of facilities that support the exhibition and livestock shows.

The park remains at its original location, though attempts were made to relocate. In 1964, the Stampede Board made plans to purchase former military land in southwest Calgary near <a href="Alberta%20Highway%208">Glenmore Trail</a> and 24 Street and relocate the park there. A fully developed plan was released in 1965, and while it had the support of the civic and federal governments, intense opposition from nearby residents quashed the proposal. Space concerns remained a constant issue, and a new plan to push northward into the Victoria Park community beginning in 1968 initiated a series of conflicts with the neighbourhood and city council that persisted for decades.

While Victoria Park fell into steady decline, it was not until 2007 that the final buildings were removed, paving the way for both an expansion of Stampede Park and an urban renewal program for the area. With the land finally secured, the Stampede organization embarked on a $400-million expansion that is planned to feature a new retail and entertainment district, an urban park, a new agricultural arena and potentially a new hotel. The expansion was originally planned to be complete by 2011, but delays and an <a href="Late-2000s%20recession">economic downturn</a> have pushed the expected completion of the project back to 2014.

Stampede Park has long been a central gathering place for Calgarians and tourists. In addition to attendance at the Calgary Stampede, over 2.5 million people attend other sporting events, concerts, trade shows and meetings on a grounds that hosts over 1,000 events annually.

Each year, a queen and two princesses are selected as Stampede royalty. They are chosen via a contest open to any woman between the ages of 19 and 24 who resides in Alberta. An emphasis is placed on horsemanship skills and ability to serve as ambassadors for both the Stampede and the city. The first Stampede Queen, Patsy Rodgers, was selected in 1946 while the princesses were first chosen the following year. The royal trio serve one-year terms during which they will make hundreds of appearances throughout southern Alberta and across North America. They then become members of the Calgary Stampede Queens' Alumni Association, founded in 1971. The association organizes fundraisers and events in support of organizations that work with special needs children.

During each Stampede, the five nations of the <a href="Treaty%207">Treaty 7</a> – the <a href="Tsuu%20T%27ina%20Nation">Tsuu T'ina</a>, <a href="Northern%20Peigan">Piikani</a>, <a href="Nakoda%20%28Stoney%29">Stoney</a>, <a href="Kainai%20Nation">Kainai</a> and <a href="Siksika%20Nation">Siksika</a> – create an "Indian Village" on the bank of the <a href="Elbow%20River">Elbow River</a> in the southern section of Stampede Park. They erect <a href="tipi">tipi</a>s, organize <a href="pow%20wow">pow wow</a>s, offer arts and crafts, and re-enact elements of their traditional lifestyle. Each year, an Indian Princess is selected from one of the five nations to represent the Treaty 7 as part of the Stampede's royalty. The village is among the Stampede's most popular attractions.

<a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> people had been frequent participants in the city's exhibitions since they were first held in 1886, taking part in parades and sporting events and entertaining spectators with traditional dances. By 1912 however, pressure from agents of the <a href="Indian%20and%20Northern%20Affairs%20Canada">Department of Indian Affairs</a> to suppress their historic traditions and to keep them on their farms nearly ended native participation. Weadick hoped to include native people as a feature of his Stampede, but Indian Affairs opposed his efforts and asked the <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Duke of Connaught</a>, Canada's <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a>, to support their position. The Duke refused, and after Weadick gained the support of political contacts in Ottawa, including future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a>, the path was cleared.
Hundreds of Indigenous peoples, representing six tribes, participated at the 1912 Stampede. They camped in tipis and wore their finest traditional regalia, making them among the most popular participants in the parade. Tom Three Persons, of the Blood (Kainai) tribe, emerged as one of the Stampede's first heroes, amazing spectators with a winning performance in the saddle bronc competition. He was the only Canadian champion of the first Stampede and became the first person to successfully ride Cyclone, a notorious horse that had thrown over 100 riders during its career.

The federal government attempted to prevent a repeat occurrence, modifying the <a href="Indian%20Act">Indian Act</a> in 1914 to make it illegal for Indigenous peoples to participate in fairs or parades without permission from the local <a href="Indian%20Agent%20%28Canada%29">Indian Agent</a>. The new law ended native participation in the Calgary Exhibition, but when Weadick returned in 1919, he successfully fought for their return to the fairgrounds. Indian Affairs again sought to ban native participation in 1925 without success. While conflicts between the Stampede and Indian Affairs continued until 1932, the Indian Village has remained a staple on the grounds.

First Nations members and the Stampede board have occasionally met with conflict. The original location of the Indian Village was on low-lying ground that frequently flooded, a problem that was not resolved until 1974 when the village was moved its current location. Complaints about low appearance fees paid to tipi owners, lack of input on committees related to their participation and accusations that natives were being exploited have periodically been made throughout the years. The Stoneys famously boycotted the 1950 Stampede following a rule change that cancelled a policy giving any Indigenous person free admittance upon showing their treaty card. The event that year was marred by violent thunderstorms, which led to apocryphal stories that the band had performed a rain dance in an effort to ruin the fair.

Despite the conflicts, the native communities around Calgary have been enthusiastic supporters of the Stampede and the Indian Village. The tipi owners have been long-term participants – many are third or fourth generation – and the Stampede has helped preserve and display First Nations cultures to the public. The village again relocated in 2016, doubled in size and featured a new exhibit displaying the partnership between the city, local First Nations and the Stampede.

In 2018 the name "Indian Village" was renamed to "Elbow River Camp" on the last day of the 2018 edition of the Calgary Stampede.

Operation of the park throughout the year requires 300 full-time and 1,400 part-time employees. An additional 3,500 seasonal workers are hired for the Stampede itself. The seasonal positions are often filled by Calgary's youth, and for many, represents their first paying jobs.
The organization is maintained by a legion of volunteers, however. Over 2,000 volunteers sit on 50 committees responsible for all aspects of the Stampede's operation. Chief among them are the board of directors. The board is made up of 25 individuals; 20 elected from amongst the shareholders, three representing the city, one the province and the most recent president of the Stampede board. Nearly half of all volunteers have served for more than 10 years, and some as long as 60.

When the Calgary Stampede brought in <a href="The%20Rockettes">The Rockettes</a> from New York City in 1964 as part of the grandstand show, they auditioned young local dancers to participate as the "Calgary Kidettes". The group was meant to be a one-time addition to the show, but proved popular with spectators, and returned for three subsequent years. By 1968, the Kidettes were renamed the Young Canadians of the Calgary Stampede and remained part of the nightly grandstand show, growing into a headline act by the 1970s. The group was modeled on the American group <a href="Up%20with%20People">Up with People</a> but with a style reflecting the pioneer culture of Alberta and Western Canada. The Young Canadians made television and live appearances throughout North America and attracted large crowds every year at the Calgary Stampede. In 1982, the <a href="Stampede%20Foundation">Stampede Foundation</a> set up the Young Canadians School of Performing Arts to offer professional training to singers and dancers between the ages of 7 and 19, paid for by scholarships from the Stampede organization. Two of the founders of the Young Canadians were director Randy Avery and choreographer Margot McDermott who remained with the group throughout the 1970s and 80s.

The Stampede Showband was created in 1971 to serve as the organization's musical ambassadors. The troupe features over 150 members between the ages of 16 and 21, and has been named the world champion of marching show bands five times, lastly being in August 2014. The group has performed all over the world, in front of royalty and world leaders, and at the opening ceremonies of the <a href="1988%20Winter%20Olympics">1988 Winter Olympics</a>. The Showband performs year round, and make over 100 appearances during the Stampede alone. They performed in the <a href="Tournament%20of%20Roses%20Parade">Tournament of Roses Parade</a> in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a> for the third time in 2012 as part of the Stampede's 100th anniversary celebrations. The Showband also performed "<a href="O%20Canada">O Canada</a>" every night during the chuckwagon races with the anthem singer singing a bilingual version. The Stampede Showriders were created in 1985 as a precision <a href="equestrian%20drill%20team">equestrian drill team</a> and colour guard that accompanies the Showband.

The Stampede has attempted to balance rodeo tradition against the concerns of <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> groups who argue that the sport is inhumane. Officials defend the sport, calling the animals the "stars of the show" and stating that the Stampede is "passionate about the proper treatment of animals". The Calgary Humane Society has found itself at odds with other organizations by choosing to work with the Stampede to ensure that stress on the animals is kept to a minimum. It is one of two such groups, in addition to veterinarians, who are on hand to monitor the rodeo.

<a href="Chuckwagon%20racing">Chuckwagon racing</a> is a particular source of controversy. Animal rights groups protest the event, arguing that the sport causes undue suffering for the horses. Racers admit the sport is dangerous, but defend their sport amidst the controversy, arguing that the animals are well cared for, and that allowing them to race saves many horses from prematurely going to slaughter.
Following a particularly deadly series of accidents in 1986 where nine horses were killed in chuckwagon racing incidents alone – including five horses in one spectacular crash – humane society officials, fans and even some drivers called for major changes to the races, while others called for the sport to be banned entirely. Numerous rule changes were announced prior to the 1987 event. The Calgary chapter of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> accepted the changes, stating it would not call for the sport to be banned given that Stampede officials had moved to improve animal safety, further changes were announced in 2011.

Tie down roping is a particular focus of efforts to eliminate the event. The Stampede altered its policies in 2010 to enforce the rules of the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association. Additionally, the Stampede was the first rodeo to introduce a no-time penalty for competitors who make a dangerous tackle in the steer wrestling event. Several more changes were made in 2011, the rule changes were announced after six animals died at the 2010 Stampede and were met with mixed reactions from both cowboys and animal welfare groups.

Such changes have not completely eliminated all risks; periodic accidents have continued to result in the deaths of horses and livestock. One of the deadliest incidents in Stampede history occurred in 2005 when, late in a trail ride meant to help celebrate the province's centennial, a group of about 200 horses spooked and in the melee nine horses were killed after they were pushed off a city bridge into the <a href="Bow%20River">Bow River</a>. While similar trail rides had been completed without incident in the past, Stampede officials announced they would not attempt any further rides unless they could ensure the safety of the horses.

Animal welfare groups have called animal deaths "depressingly predictable" and seek a boycott of the rodeo. In the United Kingdom travel agencies have been asked to stop offering tourism packages to the Stampede, and in 2010, 92 members of the UK Parliament signed an <a href="Early%20Day%20Motion">Early Day Motion</a> asking their Canadian counterparts to ban rodeo. Several groups petitioned the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to cancel their planned attendance in 2011. However, the couple attended and participated in a private demonstration of rodeo and chuckwagon events.

As of 2018, live coverage of the rodeo and Rangeland Derby competitions are broadcast by the <a href="CBC%20Sports">CBC Sports</a> website and <a href="Sportsnet%20One">Sportsnet One</a>. <a href="CBC%20Television">CBC Television</a> carries daily, late-night highlight shows, and coverage on the weekend. Supplemental coverage was, until 2013, seen on CBC's former sister cable network <a href="Cottage%20Life%20TV">Bold</a>.

The festival spirit during Stampede extends throughout the city. Parade day serves as an unofficial holiday as many companies give employees half or full days off to attend. People of all walks of life, from executives to students, discard formal attire for casual western dress, typically represented by <a href="Wrangler%20%28jeans%29">Wrangler jeans</a> and <a href="cowboy%20hat">cowboy hat</a>s. Many Calgarians have reduced productivity during the event because they take a relaxed attitude towards their usual workplace and personal responsibilities. However, the community and corporate events held during the Stampede create <a href="social%20network">social network</a>ing opportunities and help newcomers acclimatize to the city. The Stampede is an important stop for political leaders as part of their annual summer tours of the country, sometimes called the <a href="barbecue%20circuit">barbecue circuit</a>.

The pancake breakfast is a local institution during Stampede. Dozens are held throughout the city each day, hosted by community groups, corporations, churches, politicians and the Stampede itself. The tradition of pancake breakfasts dates back to the 1923 Stampede when a chuckwagon driver by the name of Jack Morton invited passing citizens to join him for his morning meals.

The largest is the breakfast hosted at the <a href="Chinook%20Centre">Chinook Centre</a> shopping mall. Four hundred volunteers are required to feed over 60,000 people who attend the one-day event that had its 50th anniversary in 2010. Other groups, such as the Calgary Stampede Caravan, feed as many as 120,000 people over ten days. The rising popularity of the <a href="barbecue%20grill">barbecue grill</a> in the 1960s and the city's population boom at the time brought with it the growth of community and company barbecues throughout the city during Stampede. Community booster groups have exported the tradition across the country as a symbol of Calgary's hospitality. Among them are the Calgary <a href="Grey%20Cup">Grey Cup</a> Committee, whose volunteers have hosted pancake breakfasts on the day of the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> championship game for over three decades, sometimes in spite of poor weather conditions for the annual November contest.

The size and number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an indicator of Calgary's economic strength. Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients, while bars and pubs erect party tents, the largest of which draws up to 20,000 people per day. Paul Vickers, who owns several establishments in the city, estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone. Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals, so much so that one hotel's satirical ad promising to safely store a patron's wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer. The parties are not without consequences, as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede, primarily on claims of infidelity. Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20disease">sexually transmitted disease</a>s, and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April – nine months after the event.

The Stampede has become inexorably linked to the city's identity. Calgary has long been called the "Stampede City", and carries the informal nickname of "Cowtown". The event's iconic status offers Calgary global publicity and plays a significant role in defining the city's image. Calgary's <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> team has been called the <a href="Calgary%20Stampeders">Stampeders</a> since 1945, and it is a name shared by other teams in various sports throughout the city's history, including the <a href="Calgary%20Stampeders%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Stampeders hockey team</a> that operated in the years following World War II.

The Stampede has strong polling support within the province. A 2006 <a href="Ipsos-Reid">Ipsos-Reid</a> poll found that 86 percent of Albertans felt that it raised the civic quality of life and considered it one of the region's most important cultural events. Nearly three in four stated they look forward to the annual event. However, critics argue that it is not a reflection of Alberta's frontier history, but represents a mythical impression of western cowboy culture created by 19th-century wild west shows.

Part of the event's success can be attributed to the close relationship the Stampede has often shared with both the civic government and community leaders. Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office, and the Stampede's ability to convince wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high-profile within the city. The Stampede operates on city-owned land, pays no property tax on its lease, and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall. It operates as a non-profit entity with all income reinvested into the park. All improvements to the park would revert to city control if the lease were allowed to expire.

Likewise, the Stampede has support from the media, which has been accused of providing an inordinate amount of positive coverage to the event while trivializing negative aspects. The local media faced national scrutiny in 2009 when both major newspapers refused to run anti-rodeo ads sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society. While the "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>" simply refused to run the ad, the "<a href="Calgary%20Sun">Calgary Sun</a>" defended its position in an editorial. The "Sun" refuted charges it was kowtowing to the Stampede and justified its refusal by claiming "we are Calgarians and allowing a group of outsiders to come in and insult a proud Calgary tradition seemed just plain wrong." The "Herald" reversed its decision a year later, running a full-page ad sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.

While 70 percent of Stampede attendees are from the Calgary region, officials work to promote the event across the globe. As such, the Calgary Stampede is known around the world. The Stampede draws foreign visitors primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and is experiencing growing attendance by tourists from Asia and South America.

Stampede officials estimated in 2009 that the city of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million. In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa's <a href="Winterlude">Winterlude</a>, the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Exhibition">Canadian National Exhibition</a> in Toronto, and the <a href="Just%20for%20Laughs">Just for Laughs</a> festival in Montreal. Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 in the rest of the city. A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150–$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.

Civic leaders have consistently noted the Stampede's impact on the city. Mayor <a href="Andrew%20Davison">Andrew Davison</a> claimed in 1944 that the event "had done more to advertise Calgary than any single agency", an opinion that has been echoed by his successors. Stampede officials have made similar claims, arguing that the event is one of Canada's most important tourist attractions. The Canadian Tourism Commission placed the event in its Signature Experiences Collection, one of six such events or locations in Alberta.

According to <a href="Ralph%20Klein">Ralph Klein</a>, former mayor of Calgary and premier of Alberta, the Stampede symbolizes the province's spirit. He cited the friendly and welcoming attitude and festival spirit of the city's populace during the event, which community booster groups export around the world. Among examples cited was the infamous <a href="36th%20Grey%20Cup">1948 Grey Cup</a> game in which two trains of Stampeder football fans descended on Toronto and launched an unprecedented series of celebrations before, during and after the game that included riding a horse into the lobby of the <a href="Fairmont%20Royal%20York">Royal York Hotel</a>. The events helped turn the Grey Cup into a national festival and the largest single-day sporting event in the country.

Rotavirus

Rotavirus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="double-stranded%20RNA%20viruses">double-stranded RNA viruses</a> in the <a href="Family%20%28taxonomy%29">family</a> "Reoviridae". Rotaviruses are the most common cause of <a href="Diarrhea">diarrhoeal disease</a> among infants and young children. Nearly every child in the world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by the age of five. <a href="Immunity%20%28medical%29">Immunity</a> develops with each infection, so subsequent infections are less severe; adults are rarely affected. There are nine <a href="species">species</a> of the genus, referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. "Rotavirus A", the most common species, causes more than 90% of rotavirus infections in humans.

The virus is transmitted by the <a href="fecal-oral%20route">faecal-oral route</a>. It infects and damages the <a href="enterocyte">cells</a> that line the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a> and causes <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> (which is often called "stomach flu" despite having no relation to <a href="influenza">influenza</a>). Although "Rotavirus" was discovered in 1973 by <a href="Ruth%20Bishop">Ruth Bishop</a> and her colleagues by electron micrograph images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children, its importance has historically been underestimated within the <a href="public%20health">public health</a> community, particularly in <a href="developing%20country">developing countries</a>. In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects animals, and is a <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> of livestock.

Rotaviral enteritis is usually an easily managed disease of childhood, but in 2013, rotaviruses caused 37 percent of deaths of children from diarrhoea and 215,000 deaths worldwide, and almost two million more became severely ill. Most of these deaths occurred in developing countries. In the United States, before initiation of the <a href="Rotavirus%20vaccine">rotavirus vaccination</a> programme in the 2000s, rotavirus caused about 2.7 million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children, almost 60,000 hospitalisations, and around 37 deaths each year. Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United States, hospitalisation rates have fallen significantly. Public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing <a href="oral%20rehydration%20therapy">oral rehydration therapy</a> for infected children and <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> to prevent the disease. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies.

There are nine species of rotavirus, referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. Humans are primarily infected by the species "rotavirus A". A–E species cause disease in other animals, species E and H in pigs, D, F and G in birds and I in cats.
Within "rotavirus A" there are different strains, called <a href="serovar">serotype</a>s. As with <a href="Influenza">influenza virus</a>, a dual classification system is used based on two proteins on the surface of the virus. The <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a> VP7 defines the G serotypes and the <a href="protease">protease</a>-sensitive protein VP4 defines P serotypes. Because the two genes that determine G-types and P-types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses, different combinations are found. A whole genome genotyping system has been established for "rotavirus A", which has been used to determine the origin of atypical strains. The prevalence of the individual G-types and P-types varies between, and within, countries and years.

The <a href="genome">genome</a> of rotaviruses consists of 11 unique double helix molecules of <a href="RNA">RNA</a> (dsRNA) which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a <a href="gene">gene</a>, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one <a href="protein">protein</a>, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA is surrounded by a three-layered <a href="truncated%20icosahedron">icosahedral</a> protein <a href="capsid">capsid</a>. Viral particles are up to 76.5 nm in diameter and are not <a href="viral%20envelope">enveloped</a>.

There are six viral proteins (VPs) that form the virus particle (<a href="virion">virion</a>). These "structural" proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition to the VPs, there are six <a href="nonstructural%20protein">"nonstructural" proteins</a> (NSPs), that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. These are called <a href="NSP1%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP1</a>, <a href="NSP2%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP2</a>, <a href="NSP3%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP3</a>, <a href="NSP4%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP4</a>, <a href="NSP5%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP5</a> and <a href="NSP6%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP6</a>.

At least six of the twelve proteins <a href="coding%20region">encoded</a> by the rotavirus genome bind <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood; their functions are thought to be related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion, mRNA transport to the site of genome replication, and <a href="messenger%20RNA">mRNA</a> translation and regulation of gene expression.

VP1 is located in the core of the virus particle and is an <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a> <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>. In an infected cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced virus particles.

VP2 forms the core layer of the virion and binds the RNA genome.

VP3 is part of the inner core of the virion and is an enzyme called <a href="guanylyl%20transferase">guanylyl transferase</a>. This is a <a href="capping%20enzyme">capping enzyme</a> that catalyses the formation of the <a href="5%27%20cap">5' cap</a> in the <a href="post-transcriptional%20modification">post-transcriptional modification</a> of mRNA. The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a> degrading enzymes called <a href="nucleases">nucleases</a>.

VP4 is on the surface of the virion that protrudes as a spike. It binds to molecules on the surface of cells called <a href="Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptors</a> and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the <a href="protease">protease</a> enzyme <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a>, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how <a href="virulent">virulent</a> the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus. In humans there is an association between the blood group secretor status and susceptibility to infection. Non-secretors seem resistant to infection by types P[4] and P[8], indicating that blood group antigens are the receptors for these genotypes.

VP6 forms the bulk of the capsid. It is highly <a href="antigen">antigen</a>ic and can be used to identify rotavirus species. This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections.

VP7 is a <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a> that forms the outer surface of the virion. Apart from its structural functions, it determines the G-type of the strain and, along with VP4, is involved in <a href="Immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> to infection.

NSP1, the product of gene 5, is a <a href="nonstructural%20protein">nonstructural</a> RNA-binding protein. NSP1 also blocks the <a href="interferon">interferon</a> response, the part of the <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune system</a> that protects cells from viral infection. NSP1 causes the <a href="proteosome">proteosome</a> to degrade key signaling components required to stimulate production of interferon in an infected cell and to respond to interferon secreted by adjacent cells. Targets for degradation include several <a href="interferon%20regulatory%20factors">IRF</a> transcription factors required for interferon gene transcription.

NSP2 is an <a href="RNA-binding%20protein">RNA-binding protein</a> that accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions (<a href="viroplasm">viroplasm</a>s) and is required for genome replication.

NSP3 is bound to viral mRNAs in infected cells and it is responsible for the shutdown of cellular protein synthesis. NSP3 inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mRNA. First, NSP3 ejects <a href="poly%28A%29-binding%20protein">poly(A)-binding protein</a> (PABP) from the translation initiation factor <a href="eIF4F">eIF4F</a>. PABP is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a 3' <a href="poly%28A%29%20tail">poly(A) tail</a>, which is found on most host cell transcripts. Second, NSP3 inactivates <a href="eIF2">eIF2</a> by stimulating its phosphorylation. Efficient translation of rotavirus mRNA, which lacks the 3' poly(A) tail, does not require either of these factors.

NSP4 is a viral <a href="enterotoxin">enterotoxin</a> that induces diarrhoea and was the first viral enterotoxin discovered.

NSP5 is encoded by genome segment 11 of rotavirus A. In virus-infected cells NSP5 accumulates in the viroplasm.

NSP6 is a nucleic acid binding protein and is encoded by gene 11 from an out-of-phase <a href="open%20reading%20frame">open reading frame</a>.
This table is based on the <a href="simian">simian</a> rotavirus strain SA11. RNA-protein coding assignments differ in some strains.

The virus enters cells by <a href="endocytosis">receptor mediated endocytosis</a> and form a <a href="Vesicle%20%28biology%29">vesicle</a> known as an <a href="endosome">endosome</a>. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the <a href="Calcium%20in%20biology">calcium</a> concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 <a href="Trimer%20%28biochemistry%29">trimer</a>s into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).

The eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral <a href="RNA%20replicase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a> that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.

During the infection, rotaviruses produce mRNA for both <a href="protein%20biosynthesis">protein biosynthesis</a> and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. In the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from <a href="siRNA">siRNA</a>-induced RNase degradation. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference "in vitro" results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a> where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The <a href="Offspring">progeny</a> viruses are released from the cell by <a href="cell%20lysis">lysis</a>.

Rotaviruses are transmitted by the <a href="fecal-oral%20route">fæcal-oral route</a>, via contact with contaminated hands, surfaces and objects, and possibly by the respiratory route. Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious. The faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person.

Rotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in <a href="estuary">estuary</a> samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days. Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus, as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar.

Rotaviral enteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, watery diarrhoea and low-grade <a href="fever">fever</a>. Once a child is infected by the virus, there is an <a href="incubation%20period">incubation period</a> of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. <a href="Dehydration">Dehydration</a> is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection.

"Rotavirus A" infections can occur throughout life: the first usually <a href="Symptom%23Types">produces symptoms</a>, but subsequent infections are typically mild or <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>, as the immune system provides some protection. Consequently, symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards 45 years of age. The most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age, the elderly, and those with <a href="immunodeficiency">immunodeficiency</a>. Due to immunity acquired in childhood, most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus; gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus, but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain the transmission of infection in the community. There is some evidence to suggest blood group secretor status and the predominant bacteria in the gut can impact on the susceptibility to infection by rotaviruses.

Rotaviruses replicate mainly in the <a href="Gut%20%28zoology%29">gut</a>, and infect enterocytes of the <a href="Intestinal%20villus">villi</a> of the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a>, leading to structural and functional changes of the <a href="epithelium">epithelium</a>. There is evidence in humans, and particularly in animal models of extraintestinal dissemination of infectious virus to other organs and macrophages.

The diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of the virus. <a href="Malabsorption">Malabsorption</a> occurs because of the destruction of gut cells called <a href="enterocyte">enterocyte</a>s. The <a href="enterotoxin">toxic</a> rotavirus protein <a href="NSP4%20%28rotavirus%29">NSP4</a> induces age- and <a href="calcium">calcium</a> ion-dependent <a href="chloride">chloride</a> secretion, disrupts <a href="Sodium-glucose%20transport%20proteins">SGLT1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter 2)</a> <a href="Membrane%20transport%20protein">transporter</a>-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of <a href="Brush%20border">brush-border membrane</a> <a href="disaccharidase">disaccharidase</a>s, and activates the calcium ion-dependent <a href="secretion">secretory</a> <a href="reflex">reflex</a>es of the <a href="enteric%20nervous%20system">enteric nervous system</a>. The elevated concentrations of calcium ions in the cytosol (which are required for the assembly of the progeny viruses) is achieved by NSP4 acting as a <a href="viroporin">viroporin</a>. This increase in calcium ions leads to autophagy (self destruction) of the infected enterocytes.

NSP4 is also secreted. This extracellular form, which is modified by <a href="protease">protease enzymes</a> in the gut, is an enterotoxin which acts on uninfected cells via <a href="integrin">integrin</a> receptors, which in turn cause and increase in intracellular calcium ion concentrations, secretory diarrhoea and autophagy.

The vomiting, which is a characteristic of rotaviral enteritis, is caused by the virus infecting the <a href="enterochromaffin%20cell">enterochromaffin cell</a>s on the lining of the digestive tract. The infection stimulates the production of 5' hydroxytryptamine (<a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>). This activates vagal afferent nerves, which in turn activates the cells of the brain stem that control the vomiting reflex.

Healthy enterocytes secrete <a href="lactase">lactase</a> into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child's diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the <a href="disaccharide">disaccharide</a> <a href="lactose">lactose</a> in the gut.

Rotaviruses elicit both B and T cell immune responses. Antibodies to the rotavirus VP4 and VP7 proteins neutralise viral infectivity "in vitro" and "in vivo". Specific antibodies of the classes IgM, IgA and IgG are produced, which have been shown to protect against rotavirus infection by the passive transfer of the antibodies in animals. Maternal trans-placental IgG might play a role in the protection neonates from rotavirus infections, but on the other hand might reduce vaccine efficacy.

Following infection by rotaviruses there is a rapid innate immune response involving types I and III <a href="interferon">interferon</a>s and other <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s (particularly Th1 and Th2 ) which inhibit the replication of the virus and recruit <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s, and <a href="natural%20killer%20cell">natural killer cell</a>s to the rotavirus infected cells. The rotavirus dsRNA activates pattern recognition receptors such <a href="toll-like%20receptor">toll-like receptor</a>s that stimulate the production of interferons. The rotavirus protein NSP1 counteracts the effects of type 1 interferons by suppressing the activity of the interferon regulatory proteins IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7.

The levels of IgG and IgA in the blood, and IgA in the gut correlate with protection from infection. Rotavirus specific serum IgG and IgA at high <a href="titre">titre</a>s (e.g. >1:200) have been claimed to be protective and there is a significant correlation between IgA titres and rotavirus vaccine efficacy.

Diagnosis of infection with a rotavirus normally follows diagnosis of <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> as the cause of severe diarrhoea. Most children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis are tested for "".
Specific <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of infection with ' is made by finding the virus in the child's <a href="Human%20feces">stool</a> by <a href="enzyme%20immunoassay">enzyme immunoassay</a>. There are several licensed test kits on the market which are sensitive, specific and detect all serotypes of '. Other methods, such as <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a> and <a href="PCR">PCR</a> (polymerase chain reaction), are used in research laboratories. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (<a href="RT-PCR">RT-PCR</a>) can detect and identify all species and serotypes of human rotaviruses.

Treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, <a href="management%20of%20dehydration">management of dehydration</a>. If untreated, children can die from the resulting severe dehydration. Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of <a href="oral%20rehydration%20therapy">oral rehydration therapy</a>, during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains specific amounts of salt and sugar. In 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity <a href="Oral%20rehydration%20therapy">oral rehydration solution</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenous therapy</a> or <a href="nasogastric%20intubation">nasogastric intubation</a>, and the child's <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s and <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a> are monitored. <a href="Probiotic">Probiotic</a>s have been shown to reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology "effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as "<a href="Lactobacillus%20rhamnosus">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</a>" or "<a href="Saccharomyces%20boulardii">Saccharomyces boulardii</a>", <a href="diosmectite">diosmectite</a> or <a href="racecadotril">racecadotril</a>." Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent.

<a href="Thiazolides">Thiazolides</a> are class of antivirals that may be effective in treating rotavirus, according to studies. This treatment is not approved for rotavirus by the FDA and its use constitutes an off-label treatment.

Rotaviruses are highly contagious and cannot be treated with antibiotics or other drugs. Because improved <a href="sanitation">sanitation</a> does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, and the rate of hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. In 1998, a <a href="rotavirus%20vaccine">rotavirus vaccine</a> was licensed for use in the United States. <a href="Clinical%20trials">Clinical trials</a> in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by "rotavirus A", and researchers had detected no <a href="statistical%20significance">statistically significant</a> serious <a href="adverse%20drug%20reaction">adverse effects</a>. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for <a href="Intussusception%20%28medical%20disorder%29">intussusception</a>, a type of <a href="bowel%20obstruction">bowel obstruction</a>, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.
In 2006, two new vaccines against "" infection were shown to be safe and effective in children, and in 2009, the WHO recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes.

The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49–92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17–55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotaviruses have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine. Globally, vaccination has reduced hospital admissions and emergency department visits by a median of 67%.

Rotavirus vaccines are licensed in over 100 countries, and more than 80 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination, almost half with the support of <a href="Gavi%2C%20the%20Vaccine%20Alliance">Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance</a>. To make rotavirus vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, <a href="PATH%20%28global%20health%20organization%29">PATH</a> (formerly Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), the WHO, the U.S. <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, and Gavi have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.

"Rotavirus A", which accounts for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a> worldwide. Each year rotaviruses cause millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2 million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus infections, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotaviruses by age five. Rotaviruses are the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for about a third of the cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus infections.
In the pre-vaccination era, rotavirus infections occurred primarily during cool, dry seasons. The number attributable to food contamination is unknown.

Outbreaks of "rotavirus A" diarrhoea are common among hospitalised infants, young children attending day care centres, and elderly people in nursing homes. An outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in Colorado in 1981.
During 2005, the largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak was associated with mutations in the "rotavirus A" genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.

"Rotavirus B", also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of people of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. "Rotavirus B" infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by "rotavirus B" have been confined to <a href="mainland%20China">mainland China</a>, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.
"Rotavirus C" has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children, and small outbreaks have occurred in families.

Rotaviruses infect the young of many species of animals and they are a major cause of diarrhoea in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to <a href="Reassortment">reassortants</a> with human strains.

In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes proved that a filterable agent in the faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown to be related to the virus causing scours. In 1973, <a href="Ruth%20Bishop">Ruth Bishop</a> and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.

In 1974, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Flewett">Thomas Henry Flewett</a> suggested the name "rotavirus" after observing that, when viewed through an <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>, a rotavirus particle looks like a wheel ("rota" in Latin) the name was officially recognised by the <a href="International%20Committee%20on%20Taxonomy%20of%20Viruses">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotaviruses from humans were first grown in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a>s derived from monkey kidneys, by adding <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a> (an enzyme found in the <a href="duodenum">duodenum</a> of <a href="mammals">mammals</a> and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotaviruses in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.

German battleship Bismarck

Bismarck was the first of two s built for <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>". Named after Chancellor <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, the ship was laid down at the <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a> shipyard in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. "Bismarck" and her sister ship were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.

In the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, <a href="Ernst%20Lindemann">Captain Ernst Lindemann</a>, "Bismarck" conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Rhein%C3%BCbung">"Rheinübung"</a>. The ship, along with the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a>, the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> initially engaged "Prinz Eugen", probably by mistake, while engaged "Bismarck". In the ensuing battle "Hood" was destroyed by the combined fire of "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen", who then damaged "Prince of Wales" and forced her retreat. "Bismarck" suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the raiding mission.

The destruction of "Hood" spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for <a href="occupied%20France">occupied France</a> to effect repairs, "Bismarck" was attacked by 16 obsolescent <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s from the aircraft carrier ; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">her final battle</a> the following morning, the already-crippled "Bismarck" was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by <a href="Robert%20Ballard">Robert Ballard</a>, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.

The two s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the <a href="Anglo-German%20Naval%20Agreement">Anglo-German Naval Agreement</a> of 1935, "Bismarck" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister</a> were nominally within the limit imposed by the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington regime</a> that governed battleship construction in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an "escalator clause" that permitted displacements as high as .

"Bismarck" displaced <a href="Standard%20displacement">as built</a> and <a href="Full-load%20displacement">fully loaded</a>, with an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a maximum <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . The battleship was Germany's largest warship, and displaced more than any other European battleship, with the exception of , commissioned after the end of the war. "Bismarck" was powered by three Blohm & Voss geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s and twelve oil-fired Wagner <a href="Superheated%20steam">superheated</a> <a href="Water-tube%20boiler">boilers</a>, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of on speed trials. The ship had a cruising range of at . "Bismarck" was equipped with three FuMO 23 search <a href="radar">radar</a> sets, mounted on the forward and stern <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s and foretop.

The standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men. The crew was divided into twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions were assigned to the ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary <a href="Artillery%20battery%23Naval%20usage">batteries</a> and five and six manning <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The <a href="radio%20operator">radio operator</a>s, signalmen, and <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>s were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a> personnel. When "Bismarck" left port, fleet staff, <a href="prize%20crews">prize crews</a>, and <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a>s increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men. Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which had been lost during <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation Weserübung</a>, the German invasion of Norway. "Bismarck"s crew published a ship's newspaper titled "Die Schiffsglocke" (The Ship's Bell); this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.

"Bismarck" was armed with eight <a href="38%20cm%20SK%20C/34%20naval%20gun">SK C/34 guns</a> arranged in four twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s: two <a href="superfire">super-firing</a> turrets forward—"Anton" and "Bruno"—and two aft—"Caesar" and "Dora". Secondary armament consisted of twelve <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20C/28">L/55</a> guns, sixteen <a href="10.5%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm%20FlaK%2038">L/65</a> and sixteen <a href="3.7%20cm%20SK%20C/30">L/83</a>, and twelve <a href="2%20cm%20Flak%2030/38/Flakvierling"></a> anti-aircraft guns. "Bismarck" also carried four <a href="Arado%20Ar%20196">Arado Ar 196</a> reconnaissance <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s, with a single large hangar and a double-ended <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a>. The ship's <a href="belt%20armour">main belt</a> was thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were and thick, respectively. The turrets were protected by thick faces and thick sides.

"Bismarck" was ordered under the name "Ersatz Hannover" (""Hannover" replacement"), a replacement for the old <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> , under contract "F". The contract was awarded to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where the <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid on 1 July 1936 at Helgen IX. The ship was launched on 14 February 1939 and during the elaborate ceremonies was christened by Dorothee von Löwenfeld, granddaughter of Chancellor <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, the ship's namesake. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> made the christening speech. <a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a> work followed the launch, during which time the original straight <a href="Stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a> was replaced with a raked "Atlantic bow" similar to those of the s. "Bismarck" was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940 for <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, which were conducted in the Baltic. "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" <a href="Ernst%20Lindemann">Ernst Lindemann</a> took command of the ship at the time of commissioning.

On 15 September 1940, three weeks after commissioning, "Bismarck" left Hamburg to begin sea trials in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a>. "<a href="Sperrbrecher">Sperrbrecher</a> 13" escorted the ship to <a href="Cape%20Arkona">Arcona</a> on 28 September, and then on to <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a> for trials in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Danzig">Gulf of Danzig</a>. The ship's power-plant was given a thorough workout; "Bismarck" made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering <a href="propeller%20%28ship%29">propeller</a> revolutions, the crew learned that "Bismarck" could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. "Bismarck"s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; "Bismarck" returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.

The ship was scheduled to return to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 24 January 1941, but a merchant vessel had been sunk in the <a href="Kiel%20Canal">Kiel Canal</a> and prevented use of the waterway. Severe weather hampered efforts to remove the wreck, and "Bismarck" was not able to reach Kiel until March. The delay greatly frustrated Lindemann, who remarked that "["Bismarck"] had been tied down at Hamburg for five weeks ... the precious time at sea lost as a result cannot be made up, and a significant delay in the final war deployment of the ship thus is unavoidable." While waiting to reach Kiel, "Bismarck" hosted Captain Anders Forshell, the Swedish naval attaché to Berlin. He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the <a href="Swedish%20Navy">Swedish Navy</a>. The information provided the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.

On 6 March, "Bismarck" received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> fighters and a pair of <a href="Armed%20merchantman">armed merchant vessels</a>, along with an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a>. At 08:45 on 8 March, "Bismarck" briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of <a href="dazzle%20paint">dazzle paint</a> to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an icebreaker, escorted "Bismarck" through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.

The Naval High Command ("<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Marine">Oberkommando der Marine</a>" or OKM), commanded by Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>, intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean. The two "Scharnhorst"-class battleships were based in <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest, France</a>, at the time, having just completed <a href="Operation%20Berlin%20%28Atlantic%29">Operation Berlin</a>, a major raid into the Atlantic. "Bismarck"s sister ship "Tirpitz" rapidly approached completion. "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz" were to sortie from the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and rendezvous with the two "Scharnhorst"-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.

Work on "Tirpitz" was completed later than anticipated, and she was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in <a href="drydock">drydock</a>. required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie. Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers and . The two ships would not be ready for action until July or August. Admiral <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20L%C3%BCtjens">Günther Lütjens</a>, "Flottenchef" (Fleet Chief) of the Kriegsmarine, chosen to lead the operation, wished to delay the operation at least until either "Scharnhorst" or "Tirpitz" became available, but the OKM decided to proceed with the operation, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Rhein%C3%BCbung">Operation Rheinübung</a>, with a force consisting of only "Bismarck" and the heavy cruiser . At a final meeting with Raeder in Paris on 26 April, Lütjens was encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy gaining any respite.

On 5 May 1941, Hitler and <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a>, with a large entourage, arrived to view "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz" in Gotenhafen. The men were given an extensive tour of the ships, after which Hitler met with Lütjens to discuss the upcoming mission. On 16 May, Lütjens reported that "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" were fully prepared for Operation Rheinübung; he was therefore ordered to proceed with the mission on the evening of 19 May. As part of the operational plans, a group of eighteen supply ships would be positioned to support "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen". Four <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s would be placed along the convoy routes between <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax</a> and Britain to scout for the raiders.

By the start of the operation, "Bismarck"s crew had increased to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, "Bismarck" departed Gotenhafen and made for the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>. She was joined at 11:25 by "Prinz Eugen", which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s—, , and —and a <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a> of <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s. The <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.

An hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> ; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. "Gotland" transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: "Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10–12 aircraft passed <a href="Marstrand">Marstrand</a>, course 205°/20'." The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by "Gotland", though both Lütjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost. The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attaché to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>. The code-breakers at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a> confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had <a href="encryption">decrypted</a> reports that "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" had taken on prize crews and requested additional <a href="navigational%20chart">navigational chart</a>s from headquarters. A pair of <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s was ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the flotilla.

German aerial reconnaissance confirmed that one <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>, three battleships, and four cruisers remained at anchor in the main British naval base at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, which confirmed to Lütjens that the British were unaware of his operation. On the evening of 20 May, "Bismarck" and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board "Prinz Eugen" picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast. At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> and anchored at <a href="Grimstadfjord">Grimstadfjord</a>, where the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard "outboard grey" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.

When "Bismarck" was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect her from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of and take photos of "Bismarck" and her escorts. Upon receipt of the information, Admiral <a href="John%20Tovey">John Tovey</a> ordered the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> , the newly commissioned battleship , and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>. The rest of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> was placed on high alert in Scapa Flow. Eighteen bombers were dispatched to attack the Germans, but weather over the <a href="fjord">fjord</a> had worsened and they were unable to find the German warships.

"Bismarck" did not replenish her fuel stores in Norway, as her operational orders did not require her to do so. She had left port short of a full load, and had since expended another on the voyage from Gotenhafen. "Prinz Eugen" took on of fuel. At 19:30 on 21 May, "Bismarck", "Prinz Eugen", and the three escorting destroyers left Bergen. At midnight, when the force was in the open sea, heading towards the Arctic Ocean, Raeder disclosed the operation to Hitler, who reluctantly consented to the raid. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. At around 12:00, Lütjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the break-out into the open Atlantic.

By 04:00 on 23 May, Lütjens ordered "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" to increase speed to to make the dash through the Denmark Strait. Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMO radar detection equipment sets. "Bismarck" led "Prinz Eugen" by about ; mist reduced visibility to . The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to . Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid <a href="Drift%20ice">ice floes</a>. At 19:22, <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a> and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser at a range of approximately . "Prinz Eugen"s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by "Suffolk" and learned that their location had been reported.

Lütjens gave permission for "Prinz Eugen" to engage "Suffolk", but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held fire. "Suffolk" quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser joined "Suffolk", but approached the German raiders too closely. Lütjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; "Bismarck" fired five salvoes, three of which straddled "Norfolk" and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38 cm guns' firing disabled "Bismarck"s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted Lütjens to order "Prinz Eugen" to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.

At around 22:00, Lütjens ordered "Bismarck" to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him. Although "Bismarck" was visually obscured in a rain squall, "Suffolk"s radar quickly detected the manoeuvre, allowing the cruiser to evade. The cruisers remained on station through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships. The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07, hydrophone operators aboard "Prinz Eugen" detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of , reporting "Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280° relative bearing!"

At 05:45 on 24 May, German lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon; this turned out to be from "Hood" and "Prince of Wales", under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Lancelot%20Holland">Lancelot Holland</a>. Lütjens ordered his ships' crews to <a href="battle%20stations">battle stations</a>. By 05:52, the range had fallen to and "Hood" opened fire, followed by "Prince of Wales" a minute later. "Hood" engaged "Prinz Eugen", which the British thought to be "Bismarck", while "Prince of Wales" fired on "Bismarck". <a href="Adalbert%20Schneider">Adalbert Schneider</a>, the first gunnery officer aboard "Bismarck", twice requested permission to return fire, but Lütjens hesitated. Lindemann intervened, muttering "I will not let my ship be shot out from under my ass." He demanded permission to fire from Lütjens, who relented and at 05:55 ordered his ships to engage the British.

The British ships approached the German ships head on, which permitted them to use only their forward guns; "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" could fire full <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s. Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20° turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on "Hood". About a minute after opening fire, "Prinz Eugen" scored a hit with a high-explosive shell; the explosion detonated <a href="unrotated%20projectile">unrotated projectile</a> ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished. After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to "Hood"; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from "Bismarck"s eight 38 cm guns. He also ordered the ship's 15 cm secondary guns to engage "Prince of Wales". Holland then ordered a second 20° turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen". Lütjens ordered "Prinz Eugen" to shift fire and target "Prince of Wales", to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, "Prinz Eugen" scored a pair of hits on the battleship that started a small fire.

Lütjens then ordered "Prinz Eugen" to drop behind "Bismarck", so she could continue to monitor the location of "Norfolk" and "Suffolk", which were still to the east. At 06:00, "Hood" was completing the second turn to port when "Bismarck"s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38 cm <a href="armour-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing</a> shells struck "Hood" and penetrated her thin deck armour. The shell reached "Hood"s rear ammunition magazine and detonated of <a href="cordite">cordite</a> propellant. The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle. The stern also rose as water rushed into the ripped-open compartments. Schneider exclaimed "He is sinking!" over the ship's loudspeakers. In only eight minutes of firing, "Hood" had disappeared, taking all but three of her crew of 1,419 men with her.

"Bismarck" then shifted fire to "Prince of Wales". The British battleship scored a hit on "Bismarck" with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on "Prince of Wales", though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain <a href="John%20Leach%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Leach</a>, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon "Prince of Wales", causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, "Prince of Wales" scored three hits on "Bismarck" in the engagement. The first struck her in the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>, completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.

At 06:13, Leach gave the order to retreat; only five of his ship's ten guns were still firing and his ship had sustained significant damage. "Prince of Wales" made a 160° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing "Prince of Wales" and destroying her, Lütjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy, firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" to head for the North Atlantic. In the engagement, "Bismarck" had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return. The forecastle hit allowed of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. Lütjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship. The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as "Bismarck" had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree <a href="List%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to port and a 3-degree <a href="wikt%3Atrim%23Noun">trim</a> by the bow.

After the engagement, Lütjens reported, "Battlecruiser, probably "Hood", sunk. Another battleship, "King George V" or "Renown", turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact." At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach "Prinz Eugen" for commerce raiding and to make for <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> for repairs. Shortly after 10:00, Lütjens ordered "Prinz Eugen" to fall behind "Bismarck" to determine the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming "broad streams of oil on both sides of ["Bismarck"s] wake", "Prinz Eugen" returned to the forward position. About an hour later, a British <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> reported the oil slick to "Suffolk" and "Norfolk", which had been joined by the damaged "Prince of Wales". Rear Admiral <a href="Frederic%20Wake-Walker">Frederic Wake-Walker</a>, the commander of the two cruisers, ordered "Prince of Wales" to remain behind his ships.

The Royal Navy ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen". Tovey's Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers , , and to patrol the Denmark Strait in the event that Lütjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship , which had been escorting and was due for a refit in the <a href="Boston%20Navy%20Yard">Boston Navy Yard</a>, joined Tovey. Two old s were ordered into the hunt: , from Halifax, and , which was escorting Convoy HX 127. In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase. By around 17:00, the crew aboard "Prince of Wales" restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack "Bismarck" if the opportunity arose.

With the weather worsening, Lütjens attempted to detach "Prinz Eugen" at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. "Prinz Eugen" was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. "Bismarck" turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing "Suffolk" to turn away at high speed. "Prince of Wales" fired twelve salvos at "Bismarck", which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted "Prinz Eugen" to slip away. After "Bismarck" resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on "Bismarck"s port side.

Although "Bismarck" had been damaged in the engagement and forced to reduce speed, she was still capable of reaching , the maximum speed of Tovey's . Unless "Bismarck" could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent her from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. At 22:00, "Victorious" launched the strike, which comprised six <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a> fighters and nine <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="825%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">825 Naval Air Squadron</a>, led by Lt Cdr <a href="Eugene%20Esmonde">Eugene Esmonde</a>. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked "Norfolk" and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter <a href="USCGC%20Modoc%20%28WPG-46%29">USCGC "Modoc"</a> on their approach; the confusion alerted "Bismarck"s anti-aircraft gunners.

"Bismarck" also used her main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers. None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. "Bismarck" evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others. The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to . Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to , the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.

Shortly after the Swordfish departed the scene, "Bismarck" and "Prince of Wales" engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit. "Bismarck"s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.

As the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, "Bismarck" was out of range of "Suffolk"s radar. At 03:00 on 25 May, Lütjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was . He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; "Bismarck" successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. "Suffolk"s captain assumed that "Bismarck" had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.

The Royal Navy search became frantic, as many of the British ships were low on fuel. "Victorious" and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>, with the aircraft carrier and steaming up from <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, was still at least a day away. Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, Lütjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board "King George V", leading Tovey to believe that "Bismarck" was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, "Bismarck" had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.

British code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for "Bismarck" making for Brest, decrypted by <a href="Jane%20Fawcett">Jane Fawcett</a> on 25 May 1941. The <a href="French%20Resistance">French Resistance</a> provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which "Bismarck" would have to pass. A squadron of Coastal Command <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a>s based in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> joined the search, covering areas where "Bismarck" might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign <a href="Leonard%20B.%20Smith">Leonard B. Smith</a> of the US Navy located her, some northwest of Brest. At her current speed, she would have been close enough to reach the protection of U-boats and the Luftwaffe in less than a day. Most British forces were not close enough to stop her.

The only possibility for the Royal Navy was "Ark Royal" with Force H, under the command of Admiral <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a>. "Victorious", "Prince of Wales", "Suffolk" and were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortage; the only heavy ships remaining apart from Force H were "King George V" and "Rodney", but they were too distant. "Ark Royal"s Swordfish were already searching nearby when the Catalina found her. Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about away from "Ark Royal". Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser to shadow "Bismarck", though "Ark Royal"s aviators were not informed of this. As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with new magnetic <a href="detonator">detonator</a>s, accidentally attacked "Sheffield". The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and "Sheffield" emerged unscathed.

Upon returning to "Ark Royal", the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, "Bismarck" fired her main battery at "Sheffield", straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on "Sheffield", killing three men and wounding several others. "Sheffield" quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; "Bismarck" began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.

The second torpedo struck "Bismarck" in her stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.

With the port rudder jammed, "Bismarck" was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships "King George V" and "Rodney" were still available, along with the heavy cruisers "Dorsetshire" and "Norfolk". Lütjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: "Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer." The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself. As darkness fell, "Bismarck" briefly fired on "Sheffield", though the cruiser quickly fled. "Sheffield" lost contact in the low visibility and Captain <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a>'s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with "Bismarck" through the night.

The ships encountered "Bismarck" at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with her main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish</a> destroyer . The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried "Bismarck", illuminating her with <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a>s and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, "Bismarck"s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with "Hood", and other important documents. The third shell hit from "Prince of Wales" had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.

After daybreak on 27 May, "King George V" led the attack. "Rodney" followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at "Bismarck" until he was about away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target. At 08:43, lookouts on "King George V" spotted her, some away. Four minutes later, "Rodney"s two forward turrets, comprising six guns, opened fire, then "King George V"s guns began firing. "Bismarck" returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled "Rodney". Thereafter, "Bismarck"s ability to aim her guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.

As the range fell, the ships' secondary batteries joined the battle. "Norfolk" and "Dorsetshire" closed and began firing with their guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from "Rodney" struck "Bismarck"s forward <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and Lütjens and the rest of the bridge staff. The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it would manage to fire one last salvo at 09:27. Lieutenant von Müllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action. One of "Bismarck"s shells exploded 20 feet off "Rodney"s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube—the closest "Bismarck" came to a direct hit on her opponents.

By 10:00, Tovey's two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range; "Bismarck" had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern. She was slowly settling by the stern from uncontrolled flooding with a 20 degree list to port. "Rodney" closed to , <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a> for guns of that size, and continued to fire. Tovey could not cease fire until the Germans <a href="Striking%20the%20colors">struck their ensigns</a> or it became clear they were abandoning ship. "Rodney" fired two torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to <a href="Ludovic%20Kennedy">Ludovic Kennedy</a>, "if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another".

First Officer Hans Oels ordered the men below decks to abandon ship; he instructed the engine room crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate as they made their way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.

The four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at "Bismarck", and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink "Bismarck" by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser "Dorsetshire" to sink "Bismarck" with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. "Dorsetshire" fired a pair of torpedoes into "Bismarck"s starboard side, one of which hit. "Dorsetshire" then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against "Bismarck"s port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, "Bismarck" capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank.

Junack, who had abandoned ship by the time it capsized, observed no underwater damage to the ship's starboard side. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg reported the same but assumed that the port side, which was then under water, had been more significantly damaged. Around 400 men were now in the water; "Dorsetshire" and the destroyer moved in and lowered ropes to pull the survivors aboard. At 11:40, "Dorsetshire"s captain ordered the rescue effort abandoned after lookouts spotted what they thought was a U-boat. "Dorsetshire" had rescued 85 men and "Maori" had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene. A U-boat later reached the survivors and found three men, and a German trawler rescued another two. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.

In 1959, <a href="C.%20S.%20Forester">C. S. Forester</a> published his novel "<a href="Last%20Nine%20Days%20of%20the%20Bismarck">Last Nine Days of the Bismarck</a>." The book was adapted for the movie "<a href="Sink%20the%20Bismarck%21">Sink the Bismarck!</a>," released the following year. For dramatic effect the film showed "Bismarck" sinking a British destroyer and shooting down two aircraft, neither of which happened. That same year, <a href="Johnny%20Horton">Johnny Horton</a> released the song "<a href="Sink%20the%20Bismark">Sink the Bismark</a>".

The wreck of "Bismarck" was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Dr. <a href="Robert%20Ballard">Robert Ballard</a>, the <a href="oceanographer">oceanographer</a> responsible for finding . "Bismarck" was found to be resting on its keel at a depth of approximately , about west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some above the surrounding <a href="abyssal%20plain">abyssal plain</a>, triggering a <a href="landslide">landslide</a>. "Bismarck" slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down.

Ballard's survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship's fully armoured <a href="Citadel%23Naval%20term">citadel</a>. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from "Bismarck"s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14 inch shells fired by "King George V" bounced off the German belt armour.

Ballard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that ""Bismarck" did not implode." This suggests that "Bismarck"s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory. Ballard added "we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact". They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by her crew, as claimed by German survivors. Ballard kept the wreck's exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts from the ship, a practice he considered a form of <a href="grave%20robbing">grave robbing</a>.

The whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure. The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank "stern first" and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 "Prinz Eugen" was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.

In June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with <a href="Woods%20Hole%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>, conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built <a href="Submersible">mini-submarines</a>. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, "You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline." The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.

An Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano—the only one in that area—to locate the wreck. Using <a href="Remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">ROVs</a> to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader <a href="David%20Mearns">David Mearns</a> claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: "My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes".

The 2002 documentary "", directed by <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> and filmed in May–June 2002 using smaller and more agile <a href="Mir%20%28submersible%29">Mir submersibles</a>, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that there was not enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.

Despite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that "Bismarck" would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that "Bismarck" could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving on the destroyer at the time). Kennedy stated, "That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." When asked whether "Bismarck" would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." In Mearns' subsequent book "Hood and Bismarck", he conceded that scuttling "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes." Ballard later concluded that "As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow."

Sense and Sensibility (film)

Sense and Sensibility is a 1995 American <a href="period%20drama">period drama</a> film directed by <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a> and based on <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s <a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">1811 novel of the same name</a>. <a href="Emma%20Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> wrote the screenplay and stars as <a href="Elinor%20Dashwood">Elinor Dashwood</a>, while <a href="Kate%20Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> plays Elinor's younger sister <a href="Marianne%20Dashwood">Marianne</a>. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, members of a wealthy English family of <a href="landed%20gentry">landed gentry</a>, as they must deal with circumstances of sudden destitution. They are forced to seek financial security through marriage. <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> and <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a> play their respective suitors. The film was released on December 13, 1995, in the United States.

Producer <a href="Lindsay%20Doran">Lindsay Doran</a>, a longtime admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay, who spent five years drafting numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were nervous that Thompson – a first-time screenwriter – was the credited writer, but <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> agreed to distribute the film. Though initially intending to have another actress portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to take the role.

Thompson's screenplay exaggerated the Dashwood family's wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Lee was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Banquet">The Wedding Banquet</a>" and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.

A commercial success, earning $135 million worldwide, the film garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release and <a href="List%20of%20accolades%20received%20by%20Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%28film%29">received many accolades</a>, including three awards and eleven nominations at the 1995 <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">British Academy Film Awards</a>. It earned seven <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> nominations, including for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>. Thompson received the award for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>, becoming the only person to have won Academy Awards for both acting and screenwriting. "Sense and Sensibility" contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen's works, and has led to many more productions in similar genres. It persists in being recognised as one of the best Austen adaptations of all time.

On his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood tells his son from his first marriage, John, to take care of his second wife and three daughters, <a href="Elinor%20Dashwood">Elinor</a>, <a href="Marianne%20Dashwood">Marianne</a>, and Margaret, since they will inherit nothing. John promises to do so. John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny convinces him to give his half sisters nothing financially; John and Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home.

Fanny invites her brother <a href="Edward%20Ferrars">Edward Ferrars</a> to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money.

Sir John Middleton, Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in and are frequent guests at Barton Park. The Dashwoods meet the older Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with Marianne at first sight. However, Marianne considers him incapable of feeling love or inspiring it in another.

One afternoon, Marianne takes a walk with Margaret and slips and falls in the rain. She is carried home by the dashing <a href="John%20Willoughby">John Willoughby</a>, with whom Marianne falls in love. They spend a great deal of time together, but on the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London.

Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, to visit. They bring with them Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years.

Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He greets Marianne uncomfortably and barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they soon learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable. Colonel Brandon later explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and abandoned his ward Beth, the illegitimate daughter of his former love. When Willoughby's aunt and benefactress Lady Allen learned of his behavior, she disinherited him and so he chose to marry for money.

Lucy is invited to stay with John and Fanny. Lucy, believing she has a friend in Fanny, confides her clandestine engagement to Edward and is thrown out of the house. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he refuses, she arranges to have his fortune transferred to his younger brother, Robert. On hearing this, Colonel Brandon offers Edward the parish on his estate, feeling sympathy for the unfortunate but honorable Edward.

On their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate and becomes gravely ill walking in torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.

The Dashwoods soon learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume she is married to Edward. Later when Edward visits their house, they learn that Miss Steele jilted him in favor of his brother Robert. Edward proposes to and marries Elinor. Edward becomes a vicar under the patronage of Colonel Brandon, whom Marianne marries. Willoughby is seen watching their wedding from a distance, and then rides away.

In 1989, <a href="Lindsay%20Doran">Lindsay Doran</a>, the new president of production company <a href="Mirage%20Enterprises">Mirage Enterprises</a>, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> novel "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a>" to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a <a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%281981%20TV%20serial%29">1981 television serial</a>. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that "all of [Austen's] books are funny and emotional, but "Sense and Sensibility" is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." She also praised the novel for possessing "wonderful characters ... "three" strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending."

Prior to being hired at Mirage, the producer had spent years looking for a suitable screenwriter – someone who was "equally strong in the areas of satire and romance" and could think in Austen's language "almost as naturally as he or she could think in the language of the twentieth century." Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a <a href="Thompson%20%28TV%20series%29">series of comedic skits</a>, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was "exactly what [she'd] been searching for." Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film "<a href="Dead%20Again">Dead Again</a>." A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt "Sense and Sensibility", although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt "<a href="Persuasion%20%28novel%29">Persuasion</a>" or "<a href="Emma%20%28novel%29">Emma</a>" before agreeing to Doran's proposal. The actress found that "Sense and Sensibility" contained more action than she had remembered, and decided it would translate well to drama.

Thompson spent five years writing and revising the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel's language to be "far more arcane than in [Austen's] later books," Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the "elegance and wit of the original." She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had "a lot of good stuff in it" but needed to be edited, and second drafts would "almost certainly be rubbish ... because you get into a panic." Thompson credits Doran for "help[ing] me, nourish[ing] me and mentor[ing] me through that process ... I learned about screenwriting at her feet."

Thompson's first draft was more than three hundred handwritten pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length. She found the romances to be the most difficult to "juggle", and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward sidelined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that "if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people ... then it wasn't going to work." At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting "a couple of women waiting around for men"; gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.

With the draft screenplay, Doran pitched the idea to various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were wary of the beginner Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's work, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.

As Thompson mentioned on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> program "<a href="QI">QI</a>" in 2009, at one point in the writing process a laptop failure almost lost the entire work. In panic Thompson called fellow actor and close friend <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>, the host of "<a href="QI">QI</a>" and a self-professed "geek". After seven hours, Fry was able to recover the documents from the device while Thompson had tea with <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> who was at Fry's house at the time.

Taiwanese director <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a> was hired as a result of his work in the 1993 family comedy film "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Banquet">The Wedding Banquet</a>", which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. He was not familiar with Jane Austen. Doran felt that Lee's films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen's storylines. She recalled, "The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didn't have English as his first language." The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson's script, to which he replied that he was "cautiously interested". Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen's humour; he told them he wanted the film to "break people's hearts so badly that they'll still be recovering from it two months later."

From the beginning, Doran wanted "Sense and Sensibility" to appeal to both a core audience of Austen aficionados as well as younger viewers attracted to <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a> films. She felt that Lee's involvement prevented the film from becoming "just some little English movie" that appealed only to local audiences instead of to the wider world. Lee said,
"I thought they were crazy: I was brought up in Taiwan, what do I know about 19th-century England? About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I realised that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier."Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a "director for hire", as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England "learn[ing] how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally ... and how to adapt to the major league film industry."

In January 1995, Thompson presented a draft to Lee, Doran, co-producer Laurie Borg, and others working on the production, and spent the next two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback. Thompson would continue making revisions throughout production of the film, including altering scenes to meet budgetary concerns, adding dialogue changes, and changing certain aspects to better fit the actors. Brandon's confession scene, for instance, initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before Thompson decided it was "emotionally more interesting to let Brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult."

Thompson initially hoped that Doran would cast sisters <a href="Natasha%20Richardson">Natasha</a> and <a href="Joely%20Richardson">Joely Richardson</a> as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a "big-deal movie star" after her critically successful role in the 1992 film "<a href="Howards%20End%20%28film%29">Howards End</a>", to play Elinor. The actress replied that at the age of thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor's age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of <a href="spinster">spinster</a>hood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was "desperate to get into a corset and act it and stop thinking about it as a script."

The formal casting process began in February 1995, though some of the actors met with Thompson the previous year to help her conceptualise the script. Lee eventually cast all but one of them: <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> (as Edward Ferrars), <a href="Robert%20Hardy">Robert Hardy</a> (as Sir John Middleton), <a href="Harriet%20Walter">Harriet Walter</a> (as Fanny Ferrars Dashwood), <a href="Imelda%20Staunton">Imelda Staunton</a> (as Charlotte Jennings Palmer), and <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> (as Mr. Palmer). <a href="Amanda%20Root">Amanda Root</a> had also worked with Thompson on the screenplay, but had already committed to star in the 1995 film "<a href="Persuasion%20%281995%20film%29">Persuasion</a>". Commenting on the casting of Laurie, whom she had known for years, Thompson has said, "There is no one [else] on the planet who could capture Mr. Palmer's disenchantment and redemption so perfectly, and make it funny."

Thompson wrote the part of Edward Ferrars with Grant in mind, and he agreed to receive a lower salary in line with the film's budget. Grant called her screenplay "genius", explaining "I've always been a <a href="philistinism">philistine</a> about Jane Austen herself, and I think Emma's script is miles better than the book and much more amusing." Grant's casting was criticised by the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), whose representatives said that he was too handsome for the part. Actress Kate Winslet initially intended to audition for the role of Marianne but Lee disliked her work in the 1994 drama film "<a href="Heavenly%20Creatures">Heavenly Creatures</a>;" she auditioned for the lesser part of Lucy Steele. Winslet pretended she had heard that the audition was still for Marianne, and won the part based on a single reading. Thompson later said that Winslet, only nineteen years old, approached the part "energised and open, realistic, intelligent, and tremendous fun." The role helped Winslet become recognised as a significant actress.

Also appearing in the film was <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the "extraordinary sweetness [of] his nature," as he had played "<a href="Machiavellian">Machiavellian</a> types so effectively" in other films. <a href="Greg%20Wise">Greg Wise</a> was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old <a href="Myriam%20Francois-Cerrah">Emilie François</a>, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, was one of the last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, "Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity in all of us just by being there." Other cast members included <a href="Gemma%20Jones">Gemma Jones</a> as Mrs. Dashwood, <a href="James%20Fleet">James Fleet</a> as John Dashwood, <a href="Elizabeth%20Spriggs">Elizabeth Spriggs</a> as Mrs. Jennings, <a href="Imogen%20Stubbs">Imogen Stubbs</a> as Lucy Steele, <a href="Richard%20Lumsden">Richard Lumsden</a> as Robert Ferrars, <a href="Tom%20Wilkinson">Tom Wilkinson</a> as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.

According to Austen scholar Linda Troost, the costumes used in "Sense and Sensibility" helped emphasise the class and status of the various characters, particularly among the Dashwoods. They were created by <a href="Jenny%20Beavan">Jenny Beavan</a> and <a href="John%20Bright%20%28costume%20designer%29">John Bright</a>, a team of designers best known for <a href="Merchant%20Ivory">Merchant Ivory</a> films who began working together in 1984. The two attempted to create accurate period dress, and featured the "fuller, classical look and colours of the <a href="1795%E2%80%931820%20in%20Western%20fashion">late 18th century</a>." They found inspiration in the works of the English artists <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>, John Hopper, and <a href="George%20Romney%20%28painter%29">George Romney</a>, and also reviewed <a href="fashion%20plate">fashion plate</a>s stored in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. The main costumes and hats were manufactured at Cosprop, a London-based costumer company.

To achieve the tightly wound curls fashionably inspired by <a href="Greek%20art">Greek art</a>, some of the actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls. Fanny, the snobbiest of the characters, possesses the tightest of curls but has less of a Greek silhouette, a reflection of her wealth and silliness. Beavan stated that Fanny and Mrs. Jennings "couldn't quite give up the frills," and instead draped themselves in lace, fur, feathers, jewellery, and rich fabrics. Conversely, sensible Elinor opts for simpler accessories, such as a long gold chain and a straw hat. Fanny's shallow personality is also reflected in "flashy, colourful" dresses, while Edward's buttoned-up appearance represents his "repressed" personality, with little visible skin. Each of the 100 extras used in the London ballroom scene, depicting "soldiers and lawyers to <a href="fop">fop</a>s and <a href="dowager">dowager</a>s," don visually distinct costumes.

For Brandon's costumes, Beavan and Bright consulted with Thompson and Lee and decided to have him project an image of "experienced and dependable masculinity." Brandon is first seen in black, but later he wears sporting gear in the form of corduroy jackets and shirtsleeves. His rescue of Marianne has him transforming into the "romantic <a href="Byronic%20hero">Byronic hero</a>", sporting an unbuttoned shirt and loose cravat. In conjunction with his tragic backstory, Brandon's "flattering" costumes help his appeal to the audience. Beavan and Bright's work on the film earned them a nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design">Best Costume Design</a> at the <a href="68th%20Academy%20Awards">68th Academy Awards</a>.
The film was budgeted at $16 million, the largest Ang Lee had yet received as well as the largest awarded to an Austen film that decade. In the wake of the success of Columbia's 1994 film "<a href="Little%20Women%20%281994%20film%29">Little Women</a>", the American studio authorised Lee's "relatively high budget" out of an expectation that it would be another cross-over hit and appeal to multiple audiences, thus yielding high box office returns. Nevertheless, Doran considered it a "low budget film" and many of the ideas Thompson and Lee came up with – such as an early dramatic scene depicting Mr. Dashwood's bloody fall from a horse – were deemed unfilmable from a cost perspective.

According to Thompson, Lee "arrived on set with the whole movie in his head". Rather than focus on period details, he wanted his film to concentrate on telling a good story. He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including "<a href="Barry%20Lyndon">Barry Lyndon</a>" and "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Innocence%20%281993%20film%29">The Age of Innocence</a>", which he believed to be "great movies; everybody worships the art work, [but] it's not what we want to do." Lee criticised the latter film for lacking energy, in contrast to the "passionate tale" of "Sense and Sensibility".

The cast and crew experienced "slight <a href="culture%20shock">culture shock</a>" with Lee on a number of occasions. He expected the <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a>s to be the "tough ones" and keep production on schedule, while they expected the same of him; this led to a slower schedule in the early stages of production. Additionally, according to Thompson the director became "deeply hurt and confused" when she and Grant made suggestions for certain scenes, which was something that was not done in his native country. Lee thought his authority was being undermined and lost sleep, though this was gradually resolved as he became used to their methods. The cast "grew to trust his instincts so completely," making fewer and fewer suggestions. Co-producer James Schamus stated that Lee also adapted by becoming more verbal and willing to express his opinion.

Lee became known for his "frightening" tendency to not "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene in order to get the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something "boring" if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would "always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to "look so old." She also commented, however, that "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice <a href="T%27ai%20chi%20ch%27uan">t'ai chi</a> to "help her relax [and] make her do things simpler." Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [Lee] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding <a href="side-saddle">side-saddle</a>.

Lee found that in contrast to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed like a human being and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an "over-the-top" performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing ... and not [let] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.

Production of "Sense and Sensibility" was scheduled for fifty-eight days, though this was eventually extended to sixty-five. Filming commenced in mid-April 1995 at a number of locations in <a href="Devon%2C%20England">Devon</a>, beginning with <a href="Saltram%20House">Saltram House</a> (standing in for Norland Park), where Winslet and Jones shot the first scene of the production: when their characters read about Barton Cottage. As Saltram was a <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> property, Schamus had to sign a contract before production began, and staff with the organisation remained on set to carefully monitor the filming. Production later returned to shoot several more scenes, finishing there on 29 April. The second location of filming, <a href="Flete%20House">Flete House</a>, stood in for part of Mrs. Jennings' London estate, where Edward first sees Elinor with Lucy. Representing Barton Cottage was a Flete Estate stone cottage, which Thompson called "one of the most beautiful spots we've ever seen."

Early May saw production at the "exquisite" village church in <a href="Berry%20Pomeroy">Berry Pomeroy</a> for the final wedding scene. From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne's first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day. Lee shot around fifty <a href="take">take</a>s, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted <a href="phlebitis">phlebitis</a> in her leg, developed a limp, and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.

From May to July, production took place at a number of other National Trust estates and stately homes across England. <a href="Trafalgar%20House%20%28Wiltshire%29">Trafalgar House</a> and <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a> in Wiltshire stood in for the grounds of Barton Park and the London Ballroom respectively. <a href="Mompesson%20House">Mompesson House</a>, an eighteenth-century townhouse located in <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, represented Mrs. Jennings' sumptuous townhouse. Sixteenth-century <a href="Montacute%20House">Montacute House</a> in <a href="South%20Somerset">South Somerset</a> was the setting for the Palmer estate of Cleveland House. Further scenes were shot at <a href="Compton%20Castle">Compton Castle</a> in Devon (Mr Willoughby's estate) and at the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>.

Composer <a href="Patrick%20Doyle">Patrick Doyle</a>, who had previously worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281989%20film%29">Henry V</a>", "<a href="Much%20Ado%20About%20Nothing%20%281993%20film%29">Much Ado About Nothing</a>", and "Dead Again", was hired to produce the music for "Sense and Sensibility". Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new "gentle" melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film's events. He explained, "You had this middle-class English <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>, and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion." Doyle explains that the score "becomes a little more grown-up" as the story progresses to one of "maturity and an emotional catharsis." The score contains romantic elements and has been described by <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> as a "restricted compass ... of emotion" with "instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way". They also noted that as a reflection of the story, the score is a "little wistful ... and sentimental."

Two songs are sung by Marianne in the film, with lyrics adapted from seventeenth-century poems. Lee believed that the two songs conveyed the "vision of duality" visible both in the novel and script. In his opinion, the second song expressed Marianne's "mature acceptance," intertwined with a "sense of melancholy". The melody of "Weep You No More Sad Fountains", Marianne's first song, appears in the opening credits, while her second song's melody features again during the ending credits, this time sung by <a href="dramatic%20soprano">dramatic soprano</a> <a href="Jane%20Eaglen">Jane Eaglen</a>. The songs were written by Doyle before filming began. The composer received his first <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for his score.

Thompson and Doran discussed how much of the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would "very much lie in the editing." Thompson wrote "hundreds of different versions" of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as "there was nothing for him to do." Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it "only seemed to subtract from the mystery." She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as "keeping plates spinning".

A scene was shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, but this was excluded from the film. Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio "couldn't stand the idea of these two people who we've been watching all the way through not kissing." It was one of the first scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it "being one of the great scenes in book history," they could not get it to fit into the film.

<a href="Tim%20Squyres">Tim Squyres</a> edited the film, his fourth collaboration with Ang Lee. He reflected in 2013 about the editing process:
It was the first film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant — these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was my job to look at something that Emma Thompson had done and say, "Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead." And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to.

Scholar Louise Flavin has noted that Thompson's screenplay contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies "sense", i.e. "sensible" in our terms, and the latter, "sensibility", i.e. "sensitivity" in our terms. Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister. To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an "erotic" invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair – a direct contrast to Elinor's "reserved relationship" with Edward. Lee also distinguishes them through imagery – Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames. Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys "the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century." Thompson uses Margaret for <a href="exposition%20%28narrative%29">exposition</a> in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret – and by extension, the audience – why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate. Margaret's altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the "feminine" side of Edward and Brandon, as they become <a href="father%20figure">father or brother figures</a> to her. The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, as well as that of Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.

When adapting the characters for film, Thompson found that in the novel, "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," and that "making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions." Several major male characters in "Sense and Sensibility" were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are "ideal" modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.

Thompson viewed the novel as a story of "love and money," noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, executive producer <a href="Sydney%20Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. "I'm from <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>; if I get it, everyone gets it," he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, "You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?" She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. "Family dramas," he stated, "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will."

The film's theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes an important element in Austen's stories and is "impossible" to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an "ambiguous treatment of class values" that stresses social differences but "underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel"; for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the <a href="vicarage">vicarage</a>. Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility are represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised "mélange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes," in which little connection is made between "individual subjects and the land that supports them." Andrew Higson argued that while "Sense and Sensibility" includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a "sense of impoverishment [but is] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted." The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a "visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage."

Gender has been seen as another major theme of the film, often intersecting with class. Penny Gay observed that Elinor's early dialogue with Edward about "feel[ing] idle and useless ... [with] no hope whatsoever of any occupation" reflected Thompson's background as a "middle class, <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>-educated feminist." Conversely, Dole wrote that Thompson's version of Elinor "has a surprising anti-feminist element to it," as she appears more dependent on men than the original character; the film presents her as repressed, resulting in her emotional breakdown with Edward. Linda Troost opined that Lee's production prominently features "radical feminist and economic issues" while "paradoxically endorsing the conservative concept of marriage as a woman's goal in life." Despite this "mixed political agenda," Troost believed that the film's faithfulness to the traditional <a href="heritage%20film">heritage film</a> genre is evident through its use of locations, costumes, and attention to details, all of which also emphasize class and status. Gay and Julianne Pidduck stated that gender differences are expressed by showing the female characters indoors, while their male counterparts are depicted outside confidently moving throughout the countryside. Nora Stovel observed that Thompson "emphasises Austen's feminist satire on Regency gender economics," drawing attention not only to the financial plight of the Dashwoods but also to eighteenth-century women in general.

In the United States, <a href="Sony">Sony</a> and Columbia Pictures released "Sense and Sensibility" on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films, first premiering it on 13 December 1995. Believing that a limited release would position the film both as an "exclusive quality picture" and increase its chances of winning <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, Columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the US; it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned $721,341. To benefit from the publicity surrounding potential Academy Award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations, the film was released within "<a href="Oscar%20season">Oscar season</a>". The number of theatres showing "Sense and Sensibility" was slowly expanded, with particular surges when its seven Oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the <a href="68th%20Academy%20Awards">ceremony in late March</a>, until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the US. By the end of its American release, "Sense and Sensibility" had been watched by more than eight million people, garnering an "impressive" total domestic gross of $43,182,776.

On the basis of Austen's reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near the time of its US release, large spreads in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>", "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>", "<a href="Film%20Comment">Film Comment</a>", and other media outlets featured columns on Lee's production. In late December, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine declared it and "Persuasion" to be the best films of 1995. Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a "marketing coup" because it meant the film "was reaching one of its target audiences." Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a "sort of <a href="chick%20flick">chick flick</a> in period garb." New Market Press published Thompson's screenplay and film diary; in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US. British publisher <a href="Bloomsbury%20Press">Bloomsbury</a> released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast's names on the cover, whilst Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress <a href="Julie%20Christie">Julie Christie</a> read the novel in an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> released by Penguin Audiobooks. "Sense and Sensibility" increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" Best Seller list for paperbacks</a> in February 1996.

In the United Kingdom, "Sense and Sensibility" was released on 23 February 1996 in order to "take advantage of the hype from "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281995%20TV%20series%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>"", another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. <a href="TriStar%20Pictures">Columbia Tristar</a>'s head of UK marketing noted that "if there was any territory this film was going to work, it was in the UK." After receiving positive responses at previews, marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences. Attention was also paid to marketing "Sense and Sensibility" internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being "bigger" than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as "just another English period film." Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", which compared the film to "<a href="Four%20Weddings%20and%20a%20Funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>" (1994). It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe. Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776, a sum that reflected its commercial success. It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.

"Sense and Sensibility" has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included on more than a hundred top-ten of the year lists. Writing for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine, <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> observed that the film's success was assisted by its "highly skilled cast of actors," as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, "Although [Lee's] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of <a href="Kazuo%20Ishiguro">Kazuo Ishiguro</a> writing "<a href="The%20Remains%20of%20the%20Day">The Remains of the Day</a>"."

<a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" lauded the film for containing a sense of urgency "that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal." LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a "right balance of irony and warmth. The result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity, filmed with an elegance that never calls attention to itself." Film critic <a href="John%20Simon%20%28critic%29">John Simon</a> praised most of the film, particularly focusing on Thompson's performance, though he criticised Grant for being "much too adorably bumbling ... he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona, and stop hunching his shoulders like a <a href="dromedary">dromedary</a>." However, many other major critics such as LaSalle, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> and <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> praised Grant's performance. Maslin wrote, Grant "rises touchingly to the film's most straightforward and meaningful encounters."

In "<a href="The%20Mail%20on%20Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a>", William Leith found "Sense and Sensibility" to be "an extremely sharp, subtle, clever, lovely looking film" that was superior to the serial "Pride and Prejudice". Leith especially saved praise for the cast, writing that Grant plays his role "masterfully" and Harriet Walter "conveys sour bitchiness like you never thought she could." Jarr Carr of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" thought that Lee "nail[ed] Austen's acute social observation and tangy satire," and viewed Thompson and Winslet's age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility. The "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" David Parkinson was equally appreciative of Lee's direction, writing that he "avoid[s] the chocolate-box visuals that cheapen so many British costume dramas" and "brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows Emma Thompson's respectful Oscar-winning script to flourish."

Out of the 1990s Austen adaptations, "Sense and Sensibility" received the most recognition from Hollywood. It garnered seven nominations at the 68th Academy Awards ceremony, where Thompson received the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Writing%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Award for Best Adapted Screenplay</a>, making her the only person to have won an Oscar for both her writing and acting (Thompson won the Best Actress award for "Howards End", in 1993). The film also was the recipient of twelve nominations at the <a href="49th%20British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">49th British Academy Film Awards</a>, including <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Best Actress in a Leading Role</a> (for Thompson), and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Best Actress in a Supporting Role</a> (for Winslet). In addition, the film won the <a href="Golden%20Bear">Golden Bear</a> at the <a href="46th%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">46th Berlin International Film Festival</a>, making Lee the first director to win this twice.

Despite the recognition given to the film, Lee was not nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> (though he was nominated for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Golden Globe</a>). The scholar Shu-mei Shih and the journalist Clarence Page have attributed this snub to Hollywood's racism against Lee, and Chinese cinema in general. Lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the Taiwan state media not to make it a "national issue," explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his country's representative.

Following the theatrical release of "<a href="Persuasion%20%281995%20film%29">Persuasion</a>" by a few months, "Sense and Sensibility" was one of the first English-language <a href="Period%20piece">period</a> adaptations of an Austen novel to be released in cinemas in over fifty years, the previous being the 1940 film "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281940%20film%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>". The year 1995 saw a resurgence of popularity for Austen's works, as "Sense and Sensibility" and the serial "Pride and Prejudice" both rocketed to critical and financial success. The two adaptations helped draw more attention to the previously little-known 1995 television film "Persuasion", and led to additional Austen adaptations in the following years. In 1995 and 1996, six Austen adaptations were released onto film or television. The filming of these productions led to a surge in popularity of many of the landmarks and locations depicted; according to the scholar <a href="Sue%20Parrill">Sue Parrill</a>, they became "instant meccas for viewers."

When "Sense and Sensibility" was released in cinemas in the US, "<a href="Town%20%26amp%3B%20Country%20%28magazine%29">Town & Country</a>" published a six-page article entitled "Jane Austen's England", which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film. A press book released by the studio, as well as Thompson's published screenplay and diaries, listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism. Saltram House for instance was carefully promoted during the film's release, and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance. In 1996, JASNA's membership increased by fifty percent. The popularity of both "Sense and Sensibility" and "Pride and Prejudice" led to the BBC and ITV releasing their Austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto DVD.

As the mid-1990s included adaptations of four Austen novels, there were few of her works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that this resulted in a "variety of successors" in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include "<a href="Mrs%20Dalloway%20%28film%29">Mrs Dalloway</a>" (1997), "<a href="Mrs.%20Brown">Mrs. Brown</a>" (1997), "<a href="Shakespeare%20in%20Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>" (1998), and "<a href="Bridget%20Jones%27s%20Diary%20%28film%29">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>" (2001). In 2008, <a href="Andrew%20Davies%20%28writer%29">Andrew Davies</a>, the screenwriter of "Pride and Prejudice", <a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%282008%20TV%20serial%29">adapted "Sense and Sensibility"</a> for television. As a reaction to what he said was Lee's overly "sentimental" film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.

"Sense and Sensibility" has maintained its popularity into the twenty-first century. In 2004, Louise Flavin referred to the 1995 film as "the most popular of the Austen film adaptations," and in 2008, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" ranked it as the third-best Austen adaptation of all time, opining that Lee "offered an acute outsider's insight into Austen in this compelling 1995 interpretation of the book [and] Emma Thompson delivered a charming turn as the older, wiser, Dashwood sister, Elinor." Journalist <a href="Zoe%20Williams">Zoe Williams</a> credits Thompson as the person most responsible for Austen's popularity, explaining in 2007 that "Sense and Sensibility" "is the definitive Austen film and that's largely down to her." In 2011, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" film critic Paul Laity named it his favourite film of all time, partly because of its "exceptional screenplay, crisply and skilfully done.". Devoney Looser reflected on the film in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" on the 20th anniversary of its release, arguing that the film served as "a turning point" for "pro-feminist masculinity" in Austen adaptations.

Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough

Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (née Jenyns, spelled Jennings in most modern references; 5 June 1660 <a href="Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates">(Old Style)</a> – 18 October 1744) rose to be one of the most influential women of her time through her close friendship with <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne, Queen of Great Britain</a>. Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne were widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became Queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and intimacy with the queen, had made her a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.

Sarah enjoyed a "long and devoted" relationship with her husband of more than 40 years, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</a>. She acted as Anne's agent after Anne's father, <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, was deposed during the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>; and she promoted her interests during the rule of James's successors, <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary II</a>. When Anne came to the throne after William's death in 1702, the Duke of Marlborough, together with <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Sidney Godolphin</a>, the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Earl of Godolphin</a>, rose to head the government, partly owing to his wife's friendship with the queen. 

While the Duke was out of the country commanding troops in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, Sarah kept him informed of court intrigue, while he sent her requests and political advice, which she would then convey to the queen. Sarah tirelessly campaigned on behalf of the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a>, while also devoting much of her time to building projects such as <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>.

Sarah, a strong-willed woman, strained her relationship with the Queen whenever she disagreed with the Queen on political, court, or church appointments. After her final break with Anne in 1711, Sarah and her husband were dismissed from the court, but she had her revenge under the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverians</a> following Anne's death. She had famous subsequent disagreements with many important people, including her daughter the <a href="Henrietta%20Godolphin%2C%202nd%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">second Duchess of Marlborough</a>; the architect of <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>, <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>; Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>; <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II</a>; and his wife, <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Queen Caroline</a>. The money she inherited from the Marlborough <a href="Trust%20law">trust</a> left her one of the richest women in Europe. She died in 1744, aged 84.

Sarah Jennings was born on 5 June 1660, probably at <a href="Holywell%20House%2C%20Hertfordshire">Holywell House</a>, <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>,
<a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. She was the daughter of <a href="Richard%20Jennings%20%28politician%29">Richard Jennings</a> (or Jenyns), a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir <a href="John%20Jennings%20%28St%20Albans%20MP%29">John Jennings</a>, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (<a href="Martin%20Lister">Martin Lister</a>) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a> (the future <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, brother of King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (<a href="The%20manor%20of%20Agney%2C%20Kent">Agney Court</a>) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister ("née" Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, <a href="Frances%20Talbot%2C%20Countess%20of%20Tyrconnel">Frances</a>, was appointed <a href="maid%20of%20honour">maid of honour</a> to the <a href="Duchess%20of%20York">Duchess of York</a>, <a href="Anne%20Hyde">Anne Hyde</a>.

Although James forced Frances to give up the post because of her marriage to a Catholic, James did not forget the family. In 1673, Sarah entered court as maid of honour to James’s second wife, <a href="Mary%20of%20Modena">Mary of Modena</a>.

Sarah became close to the young <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Princess Anne</a> in about 1675, and the friendship grew stronger as the two grew older. In late 1675, when she was still only fifteen, she met <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Churchill</a>, 10 years her senior, who fell in love with her. Churchill, who had previously been a lover of Charles II’s mistress, <a href="Barbara%20Palmer%2C%201st%20Duchess%20of%20Cleveland">Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland</a>, had little to offer financially, as his estates were deeply in debt. Sarah had a rival for Churchill in <a href="Catherine%20Sedley%2C%20Countess%20of%20Dorchester">Catherine Sedley</a>, a wealthy mistress of James II and the choice of Churchill's father, <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20%281620-1688%29">Sir Winston Churchill</a>, who was anxious to restore the family's fortune. John may have hoped to take Sarah as a mistress in place of the Duchess of Cleveland, who had recently departed for France, but surviving letters from Sarah to John show her unwillingness to assume that role.

In 1677, Sarah's brother Ralph died, and she and her sister, <a href="Frances%20Talbot%2C%20Countess%20of%20Tyrconnel">Frances</a>, became co-heirs of the Jennings estates in Hertfordshire and Kent. John chose Sarah over Catherine Sedley, but both John's and Sarah's families disapproved of the match, therefore they <a href="secret%20marriage">married secretly</a> in the winter of 1677–78.

John and Sarah were both Protestants in a predominantly Catholic court, a circumstance that would influence their political allegiances. Although no date was recorded, the marriage was announced only to the Duchess of York, and a small circle of friends, so that Sarah could keep her court position as Maid of Honour.

When Sarah became pregnant, her marriage was announced publicly (on 1 October 1678), and she retired from the court to give birth to her first child, Harriet, who <a href="infant%20mortality">died in infancy</a>. When the Duke of York went into self-imposed exile to Scotland as a result of the furore surrounding the <a href="Popish%20Plot">Popish Plot</a>, John and Sarah accompanied him, and Charles II rewarded John's loyalty by creating him Baron Churchill of <a href="Eyemouth">Eyemouth</a> in Scotland, Sarah thus becoming Lady Churchill. The Duke of York returned to England after the religious tension had eased, and Sarah was appointed a <a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">Lady of the Bedchamber</a> to Anne after the latter's marriage in 1683.

The early reign of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> was relatively successful; it was not expected that a Catholic king could assert control in a fiercely Protestant, anti-Catholic country. In addition, his daughter and heir was a Protestant. However, when James attempted to reform the national religion, popular discontent against him and his government became widespread. The level of alarm increased when Queen Mary gave birth to a Roman Catholic son and heir, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">Prince James Francis Edward</a>, on 10 June 1688. A group of politicians known as the <a href="Immortal%20Seven">Immortal Seven</a> invited <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">Prince William of Orange</a>, husband of James's Protestant daughter <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>, to invade England and remove James from power, though the plan became public knowledge very quickly. James still retained some influence, and he ordered that both Lady Churchill and Princess Anne be placed under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> at Anne's residence (the <a href="Cockpit-in-Court">Cockpit</a>) in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>; both their husbands, though previously loyal to James, had switched their allegiances to William of Orange. Sarah, however, describes in her memoirs how the two easily escaped and fled to <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>:
Although Sarah implied that she had encouraged the escape for the safety of Princess Anne, it is more likely that she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for <a href="treason">treason</a>, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.

Life for Sarah during the reign of William and Mary was difficult. Although the new king and queen had awarded Sarah’s husband the title <a href="Duke%20of%20Marlborough%20%28title%29">Earl of Marlborough</a>, Sarah and John enjoyed considerably less favour than they had during the reign of James II. The new Earl of Marlborough had supported the now exiled James; and by this time Sarah’s influence on Anne, and her cultivation of high members of the government to promote Anne’s interests, was widely known. Mary II responded to this by demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah. However, Anne refused. This created a rift between Mary and Anne that never healed.

Other problems also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">the Duke of Somerset</a>) demanded that she be granted a parliamentary <a href="Life%20annuity">annuity</a> of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah was seen as the driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the <a href="Privy%20Purse">Privy Purse</a>, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.

Sarah's success as a leader of the opposition only intensified the queen's animosity towards the Marlboroughs. Although she could not dismiss Sarah from Anne's service, Mary responded by evicting Sarah from her court lodgings at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>. Anne responded by leaving the court as well, and Sarah and she went to stay with their friends <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Charles Seymour</a>, the sixth <a href="Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Seymour%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Somerset">Elizabeth, the Duchess of Somerset</a> at <a href="Syon%20House">Syon House</a>. Anne continued to defy the queen’s demand for Sarah’s dismissal, even though an incriminating document signed by the Earl of Marlborough supporting the recently exiled James II and <a href="Jacobitism">his supporters</a> had been discovered. This document is likely to have been forged by Robert Young, a known forger and disciple of <a href="Titus%20Oates">Titus Oates</a>; Oates was famous for stirring a strongly anti-Catholic atmosphere in England between 1679 and the early 1680s. The Earl was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. The loneliness Sarah suffered during these events drew her and Anne closer together.

Following the death of Mary II from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in 1694, William III restored Anne’s honours, as she was now next in line to the throne, and provided her with apartments at <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Palace">St. James's Palace</a>. He also restored the Earl of Marlborough to all his offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, and he did not make her <a href="regent">regent</a> in his absences though she was now his <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>.

In 1702, <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">King William III</a> died, and Anne became queen. Anne immediately offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused. Sarah was concerned that a dukedom would strain the family's finances; a ducal family at the time was expected to show off its rank through lavish entertainments. Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a <a href="pension">pension</a> of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the <a href="Privy%20Purse">Privy Purse</a>, and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created <a href="Mistress%20of%20the%20Robes">Mistress of the Robes</a> (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), <a href="Groom%20of%20the%20Stole">Groom of the Stole</a>, <a href="Keeper%20of%20the%20Privy%20Purse">Keeper of the Privy Purse</a>, and <a href="Ranger%20of%20Windsor%20Great%20Park">Ranger of Windsor Great Park</a>. The Duke accepted the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, as well as the office of <a href="Captain-General">Captain-General</a> of the army.

During much of Anne’s reign, the Duke of Marlborough was abroad fighting the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, while Sarah remained in England. Despite being the most powerful woman in England besides the queen, she appeared at court only rarely, preferring to oversee the construction of her new estate, <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Oxfordshire">Woodstock</a> <a href="Woodstock%20Palace">Manor</a> (the site of the later <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>), a gift from Queen Anne after the duke's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blenheim">Battle of Blenheim</a>. Nevertheless, Anne sent her news of political developments in letters and consulted Sarah's advice in most matters.

Sarah was famous for telling the queen exactly what she thought, and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for themselves during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: "Mrs Freeman" (Sarah) and "Mrs Morley" (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.

Anne, however, expected kindness and compassion from her closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming in this regard and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, <a href="Charles%20Spencer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Charles Spencer</a>, the third <a href="Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Earl of Sunderland</a>, be admitted into the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. 

Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw as a threat to her <a href="royal%20prerogative">royal prerogative</a>. Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Lord Godolphin</a> that she did not think she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.

Sarah's frankness and indifference for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now seen to be intrusive. Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Marlborough</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Godolphin</a>. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly and away from the political side of Sarah, who as a powerful and intelligent woman he considered bossy, interfering, and presuming to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. 

Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.

Anne's apparent withdrawal of genuine affection occurred for a number of reasons. She was frustrated by Sarah's long absences from court and despite numerous letters from Anne to Sarah on this subject, Sarah rarely attended, and wrote her excuses in letters to Anne. There was also a political difference between them: Anne was a <a href="Tory">Tory</a> (the party known as the "Church party", religion being one of Anne's chief concerns), and Sarah was a <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> (the party known to support Marlborough's wars). 

Sarah did not share Anne's deep interest in religion, a subject she rarely mentioned, although at their last fraught interview she did warn Anne that she risked God's vengeance for her unreasoning cruelty to Sarah. The queen did not want this difference to come between them; but Sarah, always thinking of her husband, wanted Anne to give more support to the Whigs, which she was not prepared to do.

Sarah was called to <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> in 1703, where her only surviving son, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%20Marquess%20of%20Blandford">John, Marquess of Blandford</a>, was taken ill with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken over the loss of her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. 

After the death of Anne's husband, <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a> in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a> to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken queen to move from Kensington to <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call <a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Masham</a> to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.

Sarah had previously introduced her impoverished cousin, then known as <a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Hill</a>, to court, with the intention of finding a role for her. Abigail, the eldest daughter of Sarah's aunt, Elizabeth Hill (Jennings), was working as a servant to Sir John Rivers of Kent when Sarah first learned of her existence. Because Sarah's grandfather, Sir John Jennings, had fathered twenty-two children, she had a multitude of cousins and did not know them all. Out of kindness and a sense of family solidarity, she gave Abigail employment within her own household at <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, and after a tenure of satisfactory service, Abigail was made a <a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">Lady of the Bedchamber</a> to Queen Anne in 1704. Sarah later claimed in her memoirs that she had raised Abigail "in all regards as a sister", though there were implications that she only assisted her cousin out of embarrassment of her difficult circumstances.

Abigail was also a second cousin, on her father's side of the family, to the <a href="Tory">Tory</a> leader <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Mortimer">Robert Harley</a>, later first <a href="Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earl of Oxford and Mortimer</a>. Flattering, subtle and retiring, Abigail was the complete opposite of Sarah, who was dominating, blunt and scathing. During Sarah’s frequent absences from court, Abigail and Anne grew close. Not only was Abigail happy to give the queen the kindness and compassion that Anne had longed for from Sarah, she also never pressured the queen about politics. Anne responded with pathos to Abigail's flattery and charm. She was present at Abigail’s <a href="secret%20marriage">secret wedding</a>, in 1707, to <a href="Samuel%20Masham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Masham">Samuel Masham</a>, groom of the bedchamber to <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Prince George</a>, without Sarah’s knowledge.

Sarah was completely oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, and was therefore surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne, with the intention of informing her of the event. It was at that interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage, and Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and the <a href="Royal%20Household">Royal Household</a> for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present, and had given Abigail a <a href="dowry">dowry</a> of £2000 from the Privy Purse. That proved to Sarah that Anne was duplicitous. Despite being Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.

In July 1708, <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">the Duke of Marlborough</a>, with his ally <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a>, won a great victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oudenarde">Battle of Oudenarde</a>. On the way to the thanksgiving service at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, Sarah engaged in a furious argument with Anne about the jewels Anne wore to the service, and showed her a letter from the Duke of Marlborough which expressed hope that the queen would make good political use of the victory. The implication that she should publicly express her support for the Whigs offended Anne; at the service Sarah told the queen to "be quiet" after Anne continued the argument, thus offending the queen still further. 

Anne's next letter to Sarah was an exercise in chilling hostility, referring sarcastically to the "command" Sarah had given her to be silent. As a result Sarah, who rarely admitted that she was in the wrong, for once realised that she had gone too far and apologised for her rudeness, but her apology had little effect. Anne wrote to Marlborough, encouraging him not to let her rift with Sarah become public knowledge; but he could not prevent his wife's indiscretion. 

Sarah continued vehemently supporting the Whigs in writing and speaking to Anne, with the support of Godolphin and the other Whig ministers. The news of the public's support for the Whigs reached Marlborough in letters from Sarah and Godolphin, which influenced his political advice to the queen. Anne, already in ill health, felt used and harassed and was desperate for escape. She found refuge in the gentle and quiet comfort of Abigail Masham.

Anne had explained before that she did not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as <a href="Captain-General">Captain-General</a>. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as <a href="Captain-General">Captain-General</a> of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.

Sarah had always been jealous of Anne's affection for <a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Masham</a>, after she learned of it. Together with the Duke of Marlborough and most of the Whig party, she had tried to force Anne to dismiss Abigail. All these attempts failed, even when Anne was threatened with an official parliamentary demand from the Whigs, who were suspicious of Abigail's Tory influence with Anne, for Abigail's dismissal. The whole scenario echoed Anne's refusal to give up Sarah during the reign of William and Mary; but the threat of Parliamentary interference exceeded anything tried against Anne in the 1690s. 

Anne was ultimately triumphant; she conducted interviews with high-ranking politicians of both political parties and begged them "with tears in her eyes" to oppose the motion. The general view was that the Marlboroughs had made themselves look ridiculous over a trivial matter – since when, it was asked, did Parliament address the queen on whom she should employ in her bedchamber?

The passion she showed for Abigail, and the stubborn refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah to the point that she implied that a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah was the only one who refused to wear suitable <a href="mourning%20clothes">mourning clothes</a>. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>.

Sarah's last attempt to re-establish her friendship with Anne came in 1710 when they had their final meeting. An account written by Sarah shortly afterwards shows that she pleaded to be given an explanation of why their friendship was at an end, but Anne was unmoved, coldly repeating a few set phrases such as "I shall make no answer to anything you say" and "you may put it in writing". 

Sarah was so appalled by the queen's "inhuman" conduct that she was reduced to tears, and, most unusually for a woman who rarely spoke of religion, ended by threatening the queen with the judgment of God. Anne replied that God's judgment on her concerned herself only, but later admitted that this was the one remark from Sarah which hurt her deeply.

After hearing this, the Duke of Marlborough, realising that Anne intended to dismiss them, begged her to keep them in their offices for nine months until the campaign was over, so that they could retire honourably. However, Anne told Marlborough that "for her [Anne's] honour" Sarah was to resign immediately and return her gold key – the symbol of her authority within the royal household – within two days. Years of trying the queen's patience had finally resulted in her dismissal. When told the news, Sarah, in a fit of pride, told Marlborough to return the key to the queen immediately.

In January 1711, Sarah lost the offices of <a href="Mistress%20of%20the%20Robes">Mistress of the Robes</a> and <a href="Groom%20of%20the%20Stole">Groom of the Stole</a> and was replaced by <a href="Elizabeth%20Seymour%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Somerset">Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset</a>. Abigail was made <a href="Keeper%20of%20the%20Privy%20Purse">Keeper of the Privy Purse</a>. This broke a promise Anne had made to distribute these court offices to Sarah's children.

The Marlboroughs also lost state funding for <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>, and the building came to a halt for the first time since it was begun in 1705. Now in disgrace, they left England and travelled in Europe. As a result of his success in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough was a favourite among the German courts and with the Holy Roman Empire, and the family was received in those places with full honours.

Sarah, however, did not like being away from England, and often complained that they were received with full honours in Europe, but were in disgrace at home. Sarah found life travelling the royal courts difficult, remarking that they were full of dull company. She took the waters at <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>.

Sarah and Queen Anne never made up their differences, although one eyewitness claimed to have heard Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that she had called them home herself. <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> died on 1 August 1714 at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors had insisted on their right to be present, preventing <a href="Henry%20St.%20John%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bolingbroke">Henry St. John</a>, the first <a href="Viscount%20Bolingbroke">Viscount Bolingbroke</a> from declaring for the Pretender, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>. 

The Marlboroughs returned home on the afternoon of Anne's death. The <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement</a> of 1701 ensured a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> succession by passing over more than fifty stronger <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> claimants and proclaiming Georg Ludwig, <a href="Elector%20of%20Hanover">Elector of Hanover</a> (the great grandson of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> through Georg's mother <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a>), King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I of Great Britain</a>.

The new reign was supported by the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a>, who were mostly staunch <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s. The <a href="Tory">Tories</a> were suspected of supporting the Catholic Pretender <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>. George I rewarded the Whigs by forming a Whig government; at his welcome in <a href="Queen%27s%20House">Queen's House</a> at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, he conversed with the Whigs but not with the Tories. Sarah approved of his choice of Whig ministers.

King George also had a personal friendship with the Marlboroughs; the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a> had fought with him in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, and John and Sarah made frequent visits to the <a href="Hanoverian%20court">Hanoverian court</a> during their effective exile from England. George's first words to Marlborough as king of Great Britain were, "My lord Duke, I hope your troubles are now over;" Marlborough was restored to his old office of <a href="Captain-General">Captain-General</a> of the Army.
Sarah was relieved to move back to England. The Duke of Marlborough became one of the king's close advisers, and Sarah moved back into <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a>, where she flaunted her eldest granddaughter, <a href="Lady%20Henrietta%20Godolphin">Lady Henrietta Godolphin</a>, in the hope of <a href="arranged%20marriage">finding her a suitable marriage partner</a>. Henrietta eventually married <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Thomas Pelham-Holles</a>, first <a href="Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne</a>, in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.

Sarah's concern for her grandchildren briefly came to a halt, however, when in 1716 her husband had two <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s, the second of which left him without the ability to speak. Sarah spent much of her time with him, accompanying him to <a href="Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, and he recovered shortly afterwards. Even after his recovery, Sarah opened his correspondence and filtered the letters Marlborough received, lest their contents precipitate another stroke.

Sarah had a good relationship with her daughter, <a href="Anne%20Spencer%2C%20Countess%20of%20Sunderland%20%281683%E2%80%931716%29">Anne Spencer</a>, although she later became estranged from her daughters Henrietta, Elizabeth, and Mary. Similarly heartbroken when her favourite daughter Anne died in 1716, Sarah kept her favourite cup and a lock of her hair, and adopted the Sunderlands' youngest child, <a href="Diana%20Spencer%20%281710%E2%80%931735%29">Lady Diana</a>, who would later become her favourite granddaughter.

<a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Churchill</a> died at Windsor in 1722, and Sarah arranged a large funeral for him. Their daughter, <a href="Henrietta%20Godolphin%2C%202nd%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Henrietta</a>, became duchess <a href="suo%20jure">in her own right</a>. Sarah became one of the trustees of the Marlborough estate, and she used her business sense to distribute the family fortune, including the income for her daughter Henrietta.

Sarah’s personal income was now considerable, and she used the money to invest in land; she believed this would protect her from <a href="currency%20devaluation">currency devaluation</a>. The <a href="Dowager">dowager duchess</a> purchased <a href="Wimbledon%20Manor%20House">Wimbledon manor</a> in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, <a href="Diana%20Spencer%20%281710-1735%29">Lady Diana Spencer</a>, to <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, for which she would pay a massive <a href="dowry">dowry</a> of £100,000. 

However, <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Treasury">First Lord of the Treasury</a> (effectively the same as today's <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, good relations with the royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Queen Caroline</a>, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.

The Duchess of Marlborough was a capable business manager, unusual in a period when women were excluded from most things outside the management of their household. Her friend <a href="Arthur%20Maynwaring">Arthur Maynwaring</a> wrote that she was more capable of business than any man. Although she never came to like <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> – describing it as "that great heap of stones" – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the <a href="Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a> about the new waterworks: "I believe it will be beautiful. The Canal and Bason (which is already don[e]) look very fine. There is to be a lake & a cascade ... which I think will bee a great addition to the place".
The Duchess of Marlborough fought against anything she thought was undue extravagance. She wrote to the Duke of Somerset, "I have reduced the stables to one third of what was intended by Sir John [<a href="John%20Vanbrugh">Vanbrugh</a>] yet I have room for fine horses." 

She allowed only two features of extravagance: the Marlboroughs' tomb in the Blenheim chapel, designed by <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a>; and the <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> Column of Victory in the park designed by <a href="Henry%20Herbert%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke</a>, and finished by Roger Morris. The latter rose to a height of , complete with fine embellishments. The Duchess carefully monitored the construction of all Blenheim's features, and she fell out with anyone who did not do exactly what she wanted.

These detailed inspections extended to her smaller land purchases. After buying the Wimbledon estate (which she described as "upon clay, an ill sod, very damp and...an unhealthy place"), and <a href="Holdenby%20House">Holdenby House</a> near <a href="Althorp">Althorp</a>, she kept detailed accounts of her finances and expenditure, as well as a sharp look-out for any dishonesty in her agents.

Her friendship with Queen Caroline ended when Sarah refused the queen access through her <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> estate, which resulted in the loss of her £500 income as <a href="Ranger%20of%20Windsor%20Great%20Park">Ranger of Windsor Great Park</a>. Sarah was also rude to <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II</a> – making it clear that he was "too much of a German" – which further alienated her from the court. Her "<a href="persona%20non%20grata">persona non grata</a>" status at the Walpole-controlled court prevented her from suppressing the rise of the <a href="Tory">Tories</a>; Walpole's taxes and peace with Spain were deeply unpopular with ruling class English society, and the Tories were gaining much more support as a result.

Sarah never lost her good looks and, despite failing popularity, received many offers of marriage after the death of her husband, including one from her old enemy, <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Charles Seymour</a>, the sixth <a href="Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>. Ultimately, she decided against remarriage, preferring to keep her independence.

Sarah continued to appeal against court decisions which ruled that funding for Blenheim should come from the Marlboroughs' personal estate, and not the government. This made her unpopular; as a trustee of her family's estate, she could easily have afforded the payments herself. She was surprised by the grief she felt following the death of her <a href="Henrietta%20Godolphin%2C%202nd%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">eldest living daughter</a> in 1733. 

Sarah lived to see her enemy <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to improve her reputation by approving a biographical publication titled "An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710". She died at the age of 84, on 18 October 1744, at <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a>; she was buried at <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim</a>. Her husband’s body was exhumed from <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> and buried beside her.

Although the Duchess of Marlborough’s downfall is chiefly attributed to her own self-serving relationship with <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, she was a vibrant and intelligent woman, who promoted Anne's interests when she was princess. However, she found Anne a dull conversationalist and Sarah did not find her company stimulating. 

Sarah believed that she had a right to enforce her political advice, whether Anne personally liked it or not, and became angry if she stubbornly refused to take it. She seems to have underestimated Anne's strength of character, continuing to believe she could dominate a woman whom foreign Ambassadors noted had become "very determined and quite ferocious". Apart from her notorious bad temper, Sarah's main weakness has been described as "an almost pathological inability to admit the validity of anyone else's point of view".

<a href="Abigail%20Masham%2C%20Baroness%20Masham">Abigail Masham</a> also played a key role in Sarah’s downfall. Modest and retiring, she promoted the <a href="Tory">Tory</a> policies of her cousin <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Robert Harley</a>. Despite owing her position at court to the Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah soon saw Abigail as her enemy, who supplanted her in Anne’s affections when Sarah spent more and more time away from the Queen.

During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six <a href="Will%20%28law%29">wills</a>, the last of which was only written a few months before her death; and had purchased twenty-seven <a href="Landed%20estate">estates</a>. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> ministers such as <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt</a>, later the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Chatham">Earl of Chatham</a>, and <a href="Philip%20Stanhope%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chesterfield">Philip Stanhope</a>, the fourth <a href="Earl%20of%20Chesterfield">Earl of Chesterfield</a>. Although she left little to the poor and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32 million in today's money.
Much of the money left after Sarah's numerous bequests was inherited by her grandson, <a href="John%20Spencer%20%28British%20politician%29">John Spencer</a>, with the condition that he could not accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including <a href="Wimbledon%20Park">Wimbledon</a>. <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> remained empty for 14 years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, before it became the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. 

In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British Royal Family</a> until it became the <a href="Commonwealth%20Secretariat">Commonwealth Secretariat</a> in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and <a href="Holywell%20House%2C%20Hertfordshire">Holywell House</a>, Sarah's birthplace in <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, was demolished in 1827. Today, much of St Albans is named after the Marlboroughs because of Sarah's influence.

Sarah died, in the words of <a href="Tobias%20Smollett">Tobias Smollett</a>, "immensely rich and very little regretted, either by her own family or the world in general", but her efforts to continue the Marlborough legacy cannot be ignored. Because of her influence, Sarah managed to marry off members of her family to England’s greatest aristocratic dynasties. Among the more famous descendants of the Marlboroughs are <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> and her sons <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William, Duke of Cambridge</a> and <a href="Prince%20Harry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Sussex">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex</a>.


The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough's children who survived childhood married into the most important families in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>:

1952 Winter Olympics

The 1952 Winter Olympics (<a href="Norwegian%20Language">Norwegian</a>: "Vinter-OL 1952"), officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (<a href="French%20Language">French</a>: Les "VIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver"), took place in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, from 14 to 25 February 1952. 

Discussions about Oslo hosting the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympic Games</a> began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the <a href="1948%20Winter%20Olympics">1948 Games</a>, but <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> made that impossible. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included <a href="Cortina%20d%27Ampezzo">Cortina d'Ampezzo</a> in Italy and <a href="Lake%20Placid%2C%20New%20York">Lake Placid</a> in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo's metropolitan area except for the <a href="Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">alpine skiing</a> events, which were held at <a href="Norefjell">Norefjell</a>, from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries, along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches, creating the first modern <a href="Olympic%20Village">athlete's village</a>. The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated.

The Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries, who participated in four <a href="Olympic%20sports">sports</a> and 22 events. <a href="Japan%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Japan</a> and <a href="Germany%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Germany</a> made their returns to winter Olympic competition, after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II. Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because <a href="East%20Germany%20at%20the%20Olympics">East Germany</a> declined to compete as a unified team. <a href="Portugal%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Portugal</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">New Zealand</a> made their Winter Olympic debuts, and for the first time women were allowed to compete in <a href="Cross-country%20skiing%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">cross-country skiing</a>.

Norwegian truck driver <a href="Hjalmar%20Andersen">Hjalmar Andersen</a> won three out of four <a href="Speed%20skating%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">speed skating</a> events to become the most decorated athlete at the Games. Germany resumed its former prominence in <a href="bobsleigh">bobsleigh</a>, with wins in the four- and two-man events. <a href="Dick%20Button">Dick Button</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">United States</a> performed the first triple jump in international competition to claim his second consecutive men's <a href="Figure%20skating%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">figure skating</a> Olympic title. The 1952 Games featured one demonstration sport, <a href="bandy">bandy</a>, but only three <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a> competed in the tournament. Norway dominated the overall medal count with 16 medals, seven of them gold. The Games closed with the presentation of a flag that would be passed from one Winter Olympics host city to the next. The flag, which became known as the "Oslo flag", has been displayed in the host city during each subsequent Winter Games.

<a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> had unsuccessfully bid to host the <a href="1936%20Winter%20Olympics">1936 Winter Olympics</a>, losing to Germany, which had hosted the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>. At that time, the nation that hosted the <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympics</a> also hosted the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympics</a>. After the 1936 Games, the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) decided to award the Winter and Summer Games to different countries, but the Games were suspended during World War II. London hosted the first post-war Games, the <a href="1948%20Summer%20Olympics">1948 Summer Olympics</a>, and recommended Oslo as the host city for the <a href="1948%20Winter%20Olympics">1948 Winter Games</a>, but the city council declined. Instead, the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in <a href="St.%20Moritz">St. Moritz</a>, Switzerland.

Norwegians were undecided about hosting a Winter Olympics. Culturally, they were opposed to competitive winter sports, particularly skiing events, despite the success of Norwegian athletes at previous Winter Games. But the organizers believed the 1952 Games could be an opportunity to promote national unity and to show the world that Norway had recovered from the war. Vying with Oslo for the right to host the Games were <a href="Cortina%20d%27Ampezzo">Cortina d'Ampezzo</a>, Italy, and <a href="Lake%20Placid%20%28New%20York%29">Lake Placid</a>, United States. The IOC voted to award the 1952 Winter Games to Oslo on 21 June 1947 at the 40th <a href="List%20of%20IOC%20meetings">IOC Session</a> in Stockholm, Sweden. Later, Cortina d'Ampezzo was awarded the <a href="1956%20Winter%20Olympics">1956 Games</a>, and Lake Placid—which had hosted the <a href="1932%20Winter%20Olympics">1932 Winter Olympics</a>—was chosen to host the <a href="1980%20Winter%20Olympics">1980 Winter Games</a>. Norway became the first Scandinavian country to host a Winter Olympics, and the 1952 Winter Games were the first to be held in a nation's capital.

A special committee was assigned to organize the 1952 Games, which consisted of four Norwegian sports officials and four representatives from the municipality of Oslo, including mayor <a href="Brynjulf%20Bull">Brynjulf Bull</a>. The committee was in place by December 1947. The city of Oslo funded the Games entirely, in exchange for keeping all the revenue generated. To accommodate the influx of athletes and coaches, quarters for competitors and support staff were designed and constructed, with three new facilities (forerunners of the athlete's villages of later Games) built. The city of Oslo paid to have a new hotel constructed, the <a href="Hotel%20Royal%20Christiania">Viking</a>, used for IOC delegates, out-of-town dignitaries, and as the communication hub of the Games. For the first time in a Winter Games, an indoor ice hockey arena was constructed, which hosted the eight-team tournament. Oslo's existing central arena, <a href="Bislett%20Stadium">Bislett Stadium</a>, was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, and for speed skating events. Improvements to the arena included better sound and lighting systems, remodeled club house and press rooms, and the addition of a medical center.

In the aftermath of the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">German occupation of Norway</a> during World War II, anti-German sentiment began to affect preparations for the 1952 Olympics. Discussions were held to consider whether Germany should be allowed to participate in the Games. When in 1950, the West German Olympic Committee requested recognition by the IOC, it raised the question of whether their participation would cause political boycotts in the upcoming Games. Once the IOC recognized the West German Olympic Committee, West Germany was then formally invited to compete at the 1952 Winter Games. East Germany was invited to participate with West Germany, as a unified team, but they declined.

At first Norway was reluctant to welcome German athletes and others considered <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> sympathizers. For example, Norwegian speed skater <a href="Finn%20Hodt">Finn Hodt</a> was not allowed to compete in the Norwegian speed skating team because he collaborated with the Nazis during the war. Eventually, despite the concern, Norway agreed to allow German and <a href="Japan%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Japanese</a> athletes to compete. The Soviet Union sent no athletes to Oslo, despite being recognized by the IOC. They had intended to enter a team in the ice hockey tournament, but applied too late to join the <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a>.

Medals were awarded in 22 events contested in four sports (eight disciplines).


The <a href="Olympic%20Games%20ceremony">opening ceremonies</a> were held in Bislett Stadium on 15 February. King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> of Great Britain had died on 6 February 1952 with his daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> took the throne as queen, eight days before the start of the Games. As a result, all national flags were flown at half-mast, and Princess <a href="Princess%20Ragnhild%20of%20Norway">Ragnhild</a> opened the Games in place of her grandfather, King <a href="Haakon%20VII">Haakon VII</a>, who was in London attending the funeral. This was the first time an <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> had been declared open by a female official. The parade of nations was held according to tradition, with <a href="Greece%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Greece</a> first, the rest of the nations proceeding by Norwegian alphabetical order, with <a href="Norway%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">the host nation</a> last. The <a href="Great%20Britain%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">British</a>, <a href="Australia%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Australian</a>, <a href="Canada%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Canadian</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">New Zealand</a> teams all wore black arm bands at the opening ceremonies in memory of their monarch. After the parade of nations the Olympic flame was lit. On 13 February, at the start of the <a href="1952%20Winter%20Olympics%20torch%20relay">inaugural Winter Olympics torch relay</a>, the torch was lit in the hearth of the <a href="Morgedal">Morgedal</a> House, birthplace of skiing pioneer <a href="Sondre%20Norheim">Sondre Norheim</a>. The torch relay lasted two days and took place entirely on skis. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, <a href="Eigil%20Nansen">Eigil Nansen</a>, received the Olympic torch and skied to a flight of stairs where he removed his skis, ascended, and ignited the flame.

The bobsleigh and alpine skiing events were held the day before the opening ceremonies. Competitors in these events were unable to attend the festivities in Oslo; consequently simple opening ceremonies were held at <a href="Frognerseteren">Frognerseteren</a>, site of the bobsleigh events, and <a href="Norefjell">Norefjell</a>, site of the alpine skiing events.

After a 16-year hiatus from the Olympics Germany made a triumphant return to the <a href="bobsleigh">bobsleigh</a> competition, winning the two- and four-man events. The results for both bobsleigh events were the same, with the <a href="United%20States%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">United States</a> and <a href="Switzerland%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Switzerland</a> taking silver and bronze respectively. <a href="Fritz%20Feierabend">Fritz Feierabend</a> from Switzerland competed in both the two- and four-man competitions. His two bronze medals were the fourth and fifth in an Olympic career that spanned 16 years and three Olympics. There were no weight restrictions on the bobsleigh athletes, and the average weight for each member of the winning German four-man team was , which was more than the Olympic heavyweight boxing champion in <a href="1952%20Summer%20Olympics">1952</a>. Seeing the undue advantage overweight athletes brought to their teams, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20Bobsleigh%20et%20de%20Tobogganing">International Federation for Bobsleigh and Toboganning</a> instituted a weight limit for future Olympics.

All of the <a href="speed%20skating">speed skating</a> events were held at Bislett Stadium. Americans <a href="Ken%20Henry%20%28speed%20skater%29">Ken Henry</a> and <a href="Don%20McDermott">Don McDermott</a> placed first and second in the 500-meter race, but Norwegian truck driver <a href="Hjalmar%20Andersen">Hjalmar Andersen</a> electrified the partisan crowd by winning the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000-meter events; his margins of victory were the largest in Olympic history. <a href="Netherlands%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Dutchman</a> <a href="Wim%20van%20der%20Voort">Wim van der Voort</a> placed second in the 1,500 meters and his countryman <a href="Kees%20Broekman">Kees Broekman</a> placed second to Andersen in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races, becoming the first Olympic speed skating medalists from the Netherlands. Absent from the competition was former world champion <a href="Korn%C3%A9l%20Pajor">Kornél Pajor</a>. The Hungarian-born speed skater had won both long distance races at the World Championships held in Oslo in 1949 and then defected to Sweden, but was unable to obtain Swedish citizenship in time to compete in 1952.

There were three <a href="alpine%20skiing">alpine skiing</a> events on the Olympic program: the <a href="slalom%20skiing">slalom</a>, <a href="giant%20slalom">giant slalom</a> and <a href="Downhill%20%28ski%20competition%29">downhill</a>. Both men and women competed in all three events, held at Norefjell and <a href="R%C3%B8dkleiva">Rødkleiva</a>. The giant slalom made its Olympic debut at the 1952 Games. Austrian skiers dominated the competition, winning seven out of a possible 18 medals, including <a href="Othmar%20Schneider">Othmar Schneider</a> who won gold and silver in the men's slalom and downhill. Norwegian <a href="Stein%20Eriksen">Stein Eriksen</a> won gold in the men's giant slalom and silver in the slalom. <a href="Greece%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Greek</a> slalom skier <a href="Antoin%20Miliordos">Antoin Miliordos</a> fell 18 times on his run and crossed the finish line backwards. American skier <a href="Andrea%20Mead%20Lawrence">Andrea Mead Lawrence</a> was the only double gold medalist, winning the giant slalom and the slalom. She was the first skier from the United States to win two alpine skiing gold medals.

All the <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country</a> events were held next to the ski jump hill at <a href="Holmenkollbakken">Holmenkollbakken</a>. As had been the case in 1948 there were three men's events: 18 kilometers, 50 kilometers, and a relay. Added to the Olympic program for the first time was a ten-kilometer race for women. All the cross-country medals were won by Nordic countries, and <a href="Finland%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Finnish</a> skiers won eight of the twelve possible. <a href="Lydia%20Wideman">Lydia Wideman</a> of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross-country skiing; her teammates <a href="Mirja%20Hietamies">Mirja Hietamies</a> and <a href="Siiri%20Rantanen">Siiri Rantanen</a> won silver and bronze respectively. <a href="Veikko%20Hakulinen">Veikko Hakulinen</a> won the 50-kilometer men's race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold. <a href="Hallgeir%20Brenden">Hallgeir Brenden</a> won the 18-kilometer race and helped Norway take the silver in the 4 × 10-kilometer relay. Brenden went on to win another gold in the <a href="Cross-country%20skiing%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%2015%20kilometres">men's 15-kilometer race</a> in 1956, and a silver in the relay in <a href="1960%20Winter%20Olympics">1960</a>.

The <a href="nordic%20combined">nordic combined</a> event was held at the cross-country and ski jump venues. For the first time, the ski jump part took place first with competitors taking three jumps from the Holmenkollbakken. The 18-km cross country skiing event took place the next day. Results were tallied by the best two marks were scored, along with the results of the cross-country race, to determine a winner. Norwegians <a href="Simon%20Sl%C3%A5ttvik">Simon Slåttvik</a> and <a href="Sverre%20Stenersen">Sverre Stenersen</a> won the gold and bronze respectively. Stenersen went on to win the gold at the 1956 Games in the same event. <a href="Heikki%20Hasu">Heikki Hasu</a> from Finland won the silver, preventing a Norwegian sweep of the medals.

Crowds in excess of 100,000 greeted the <a href="ski%20jump">ski jump</a>ers as they competed at Holmenkollbakken. In 1952 there was only one event, the men's normal hill, which was held on 24 February. The King, Prince <a href="Harald%20V%20of%20Norway">Harald</a>, and Princess Ragnhild were in attendance. The Norwegian athletes did not disappoint the crowd, as <a href="Arnfinn%20Bergmann">Arnfinn Bergmann</a> and <a href="Torbj%C3%B8rn%20Falkanger">Torbjørn Falkanger</a> placed first and second; Swedish jumper <a href="Karl%20Holmstr%C3%B6m">Karl Holmström</a> took the bronze. Norwegian athletes won the ski jumping gold medal in every Winter Olympics from 1924 to 1952.

There were three events in the Olympic <a href="figure%20skating">figure skating</a> competition: men's singles, women's singles and mixed pairs. The events were held at Bislett Stadium on a rink constructed inside the speed skating track.

<a href="Dick%20Button">Dick Button</a> of the United States won the men's singles event. <a href="Helmut%20Seibt">Helmut Seibt</a> of <a href="Austria%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Austria</a> took silver and <a href="James%20Grogan">James Grogan</a> of the United States won bronze. Button became the first figure-skater to land a triple jump in competition when he performed the <a href="Loop%20jump">triple loop</a> in the men's free skate. British skater <a href="Jeannette%20Altwegg">Jeannette Altwegg</a> won the gold medal in the women's singles, the silver was awarded to American <a href="Tenley%20Albright">Tenley Albright</a>, who went on to win gold at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, and <a href="Jacqueline%20du%20Bief">Jacqueline du Bief</a> of <a href="France%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">France</a> won the bronze. The German husband and wife pair of <a href="Ria%20Falk">Ria</a> and <a href="Paul%20Falk">Paul Falk</a> won the mixed pairs competition. They defeated Americans <a href="Karol%20Kennedy">Karol</a> and <a href="Peter%20Kennedy%20%28figure%20skater%29">Peter Kennedy</a>, who placed second, and <a href="Hungary%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Hungarian</a> siblings <a href="Marianna%20Nagy%20%28figure%20skater%29">Marianna</a> and <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Nagy%20%28figure%20skater%29">László Nagy</a>, who won the bronze medal.

A majority of the <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> matches took place at <a href="Jordal%20Amfi">Jordal Amfi</a>, a new hockey stadium built for the Olympics. Nine teams played in the tournament and <a href="Canada%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Canada</a> again won the gold medal. Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey tournament thus far, but in 1956 the Soviet team began to compete and ended Canadian dominance. Canada was represented by the <a href="Edmonton%20Mercurys">Edmonton Mercurys</a>, an amateur hockey team sponsored by the owner of a <a href="Mercury%20%28automobile%29">Mercury</a> automobile dealership. Canada played the United States to a three all tie on the final day to clinch the gold, and the Americans won silver. Norwegian newspaper "<a href="Dagbladet">Dagbladet</a>" criticized the result, calling the game "fixed in advance". The official report of the USOC for the 1952 Olympics covers the game from a different perspective. Accroding to the report, by the end of the game against Canada, the Americans were mentally and physically exhausted and after scoring the third goal and tying the game they decided to focus on defense in order not to lose silver. It is important to note that Canadians at the time were considered unbeatable and even tying that team was almost impossible. <a href="Sweden%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Sweden</a> and <a href="Czechoslovakia%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">Czechoslovakia</a> ended up tied for third (Czechoslovakia defeated the Swedes in the head-to-head game, but according to the rules at the time they had to play a tiebreaker game because they were tied in points). Sweden won that game and avenged the loss in the round-robin. The Czechs believed they had already won the bronze when they defeated the Swedes in the round-robin, calling the decision to play a tie-breaking game a "plot of the <a href="capitalist">capitalist</a> countries". Canadian team was criticized for its rough play; although <a href="Checking%20%28ice%20hockey%29">body checking</a> was legal, it was not often used by European teams, and opponents and spectators alike took a dim view of that style of play.

The IOC lobbied the organizing committee to host either <a href="Biathlon">military patrol</a> or <a href="curling">curling</a> as a <a href="Olympic%20sports%23Demonstration%20winter%20sports">demonstration sport</a>. The committee instead selected <a href="bandy">bandy</a>, which had never been included in the Winter Games. <a href="Bandy">Bandy</a>, which is popular in nordic countries, is played by teams of eleven on an outdoor soccer field-sized ice rink, using a small ball and sticks about long. As it was a demonstration sport, the players were ineligible for medals. Three nations participated: <a href="Finland%20national%20bandy%20team">Finland</a>, <a href="Norway%20national%20bandy%20team">Norway</a> and <a href="Sweden%20national%20bandy%20team">Sweden</a>. Each of the three teams won one game and lost one game; with Sweden winning the competition based on number of goals scored, followed by Norway in second place, and Finland in third place. Two of the games were played at Dæhlenenga Stadium and one at Bislett Stadium.

At the 1952 Winter Games the closing ceremonies were a distinct program listing, unlike previous Winter Games when the closing ceremonies were held directly after the final event. The closing ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadium, on Monday evening, 25 February. The flag bearers entered the stadium in the same order they followed for the opening ceremonies. That evening four medal ceremonies were also held for the women's cross-country race, the men's cross-country relay, the ski jumping competition, and the ice hockey tournament.

Since 1920, the "<a href="Antwerp%20flag">Antwerp flag</a>" has been passed from host city to host city during closing ceremonies for the Summer Games. The city of Oslo gave an Olympic flag to establish the same tradition for the Winter Games. Brynjulf Bull, Oslo's mayor, passed the flag to the president of the IOC, <a href="Sigfrid%20Edstr%C3%B6m">Sigfrid Edström</a>, who declared the flag was to pass from host city to host city for future Winter Games. The flag, which came to be known as the "Oslo Flag", has since been preserved in a display case, with the name of every Winter Olympics host city engraved on brass plaques, and is brought to each Winter Games to be displayed. A replica is used during the closing ceremonies.

After the flag ceremony the Olympic flame was extinguished, a special speed skating race was held, and the figure skating competitors gave an exhibition, followed by 40 children dressed in national costumes performing an ice dance. For a finale, to the close the Games, the lights were extinguished and a 20-minute fireworks display lit up the night sky.

With a seating capacity of 29,000, <a href="Bislett%20Stadium">Bislett Stadium</a> became the centrepiece of the Games. It was the venue for the speed skating events and the figure skating competition. Bislett was large enough for a speed skating track, and a figure skating ice-rink of ; a snow bank separated the track and the rink. Because Bislett was an outdoor arena, the organizing committee chose <a href="Tryvann%20Stadion">Tryvann Stadion</a> and <a href="Hamar%20Stadion">Hamar Stadion</a> as secondary alternative skating venues to be used the case of bad weather. In 1994 <a href="Hamar">Hamar</a> became the venue for the <a href="Speed%20skating%20at%20the%201994%20Winter%20Olympics">speed skating events</a> at the <a href="1994%20Winter%20Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Lillehammer">Lillehammer</a>.

The Oslo Winter Games were the first to feature an Olympic ice hockey tournament held on artificial ice. A new stadium was built for the hockey tournament in a residential area of eastern Oslo, called <a href="Jordal%20Amfi">Jordal Amfi</a>, which accommodated 10,000 spectators in stands rising steeply from the rink. 23 of the 36 hockey matches were played at Jordal Amfi, with the remaining matches played at <a href="Kadettangen">Kadettangen</a>, <a href="D%C3%A6lenenga%20idrettspark">Dælenenga idrettspark</a>, <a href="Lillestr%C3%B8m%20Stadion">Lillestrøm Stadion</a> and <a href="Marienlyst%20Stadion">Marienlyst Stadion</a>.

The cross-country races and ski-jump competition were held at <a href="Holmenkollbakken">Holmenkollbakken</a>, located roughly from the center of Oslo. The expected number of spectators caused concerns about traffic, so a new road was constructed and the existing thoroughfare widened. Holmenkollbakken was built in 1892 and improvements were needed to meet international standards. The original wood ski-jump was replaced with a concrete tower and jump that was long. New stands were built to seat 13,000 people, and an area was added at the base of the hill to accommodate 130,000 spectators.

The hills and terrain in the surrounding area met the competitive demands for an elite cross-country ski event. A notice board was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors. The cross-country and nordic combined races began and ended at the base of the ski jump hill. The stands for the ski jump competition had to be removed during the cross-country races; spectators had only a small area from which to watch the races but were allowed on the course to cheer on the competitors.

The alpine skiing events were split between <a href="Norefjell">Norefjell</a> and <a href="R%C3%B8dkleiva">Rødkleiva</a>. The slalom courses were at Rødkleiva, located on the same mountain as Holmenkollen and Frognerseteren. The course had an elevation difference, from start to finish, of and was in length. A <a href="Ski%20tow">rope tow</a> had to be built to bring the skiers from the bottom to the top of the hill. The downhill race and the giant slalom—which made its Olympic debut in 1952—were held at Norefjell, which was from Oslo and the only venue located away from the capital city. Work had to be done to make the area suitable for Olympic competition. A bridge across <a href="Kr%C3%B8deren%20%28lake%29">Lake Krøderen</a> was built to help alleviate transportation congestion. A new hotel, two ski lifts, and a new road were also constructed.

There was no permanent bobsleigh run in Norway. Instead the organizers built a temporary course out of snow and ice. This is often wrongly assumed to have been built at <a href="Korketrekkeren">Korketrekkeren</a>. From Frognerseteren a separate long, 13-turn course was designed and built. The bobsleigh run was first constructed and tested in 1951, then rebuilt for the Games in 1952. A car was used to return the bobsleighs to the start of the track.

Thirty nations sent competitors, which was the highest number of participants at a Winter Games. <a href="New%20Zealand%20at%20the%20Olympics">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Portugal%20at%20the%20Olympics">Portugal</a> took part in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time. <a href="Australia%20at%20the%20Olympics">Australia</a>, <a href="Germany%20at%20the%20Winter%20Olympics">Germany</a>, and <a href="Japan%20at%20the%20Olympics">Japan</a> returned after a 16-year absence. <a href="South%20Korea%20at%20the%20Olympics">South Korea</a>, <a href="Liechtenstein%20at%20the%20Olympics">Liechtenstein</a>, and <a href="Turkey%20at%20the%20Olympics">Turkey</a> competed in 1948 but did not participate in the 1952 Games.

<noinclude>

The official opening ceremonies were held on 15 February, although two smaller ceremonies were held on 14 February to conform with competition schedules. From 15 February until 25 February, the day of the closing ceremonies, at least one event final was held each day.

These are the nations that topped the medal count at the 1952 Winter Games.

The Fifth Element

The Fifth Element () is a 1997 English-language French <a href="Science%20fiction%20film">science-fiction</a> <a href="action%20film">action film</a> directed and co-written by <a href="Luc%20Besson">Luc Besson</a>. It stars <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a> and <a href="Milla%20Jovovich">Milla Jovovich</a>. Primarily set in the 23rd century, the film's central plot involves the survival of planet Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> major, after a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his cab. To accomplish this, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defense of Earth against the impending attack of a malevolent cosmic entity.

Besson started writing the story that became "The Fifth Element" when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable facilities could not be found; filming took place instead in <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>. Comics writers <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean "Moebius" Giraud</a> and <a href="Jean-Claude%20M%C3%A9zi%C3%A8res">Jean-Claude Mézières</a>, whose comics provided inspiration for parts of the film, were hired for production design. Costume design was by <a href="Jean-Paul%20Gaultier">Jean-Paul Gaultier</a>.

"The Fifth Element" received mainly positive reviews, although it tended to polarize critics. It has been called both the best and worst summer blockbuster of all time. The film was a financial success, earning more than $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget. At the time of its release it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the international box office until the release of "<a href="The%20Intouchables">The Intouchables</a>" in 2011.

In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian temple to collect, for safekeeping from <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four <a href="classical%20element">classical element</a>s, and a <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> containing a Fifth Element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.

In 2263, the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories about the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who has been directed by the great evil (sending messages as Mister Shadow) to acquire the element stones.

The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, and the only "survivor" is a severed hand in a metal glove from the Fifth Element's sarcophagus that still contains some living cells. Human scientists take it to a New York City laboratory where they use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo. Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the <a href="Flying%20car%20%28aircraft%29">flying taxicab</a> of Korben Dallas, a former major in the <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>.

Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, and it is revealed that she is the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, but had been entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores for their failure to obtain the stones, but the survivors determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna in a flying luxury hotel; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner.

Plavalaguna is killed when the Mangalores attack the hotel, but Dallas succeeds in retrieving the stones. During his struggle with the Mangalores he kills their leader, rendering the remaining Mangalores unwilling to continue fighting. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft. He leaves behind a <a href="time%20bomb">time bomb</a> that forces the hotel's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the hotel and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.

As the great evil approaches Earth, the four join up with David at the weapon chamber in the temple. They arrange the stones and activate them with their corresponding elements, but having witnessed and studied so much violence, Leeloo has become disenchanted with humanity and refuses to cooperate. Dallas declares his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of the stones and releases the divine light onto the great evil, destroying its power and stopping it.

In an interview Besson stated "The Fifth Element" was not a "big theme movie", although the film's theme was an important one. He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states "What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?", and agree with her. Jay P. Telotte, writing in the book "Science Fiction Film", credited the film with exploring the theme of <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a>.

An article by Brian Ott and Eric Aoki in the feminist journal "<a href="Women%27s%20Studies%20in%20Communication">Women's Studies in Communication</a>" considered gender to be one of the film's main themes. The authors accused the film of erasing women from the introductory scenes, noting that Leeloo's reconstruction marked only the second appearance of a female in the film's first 20 minutes; the other is an androgynous, mostly speechless presidential aide. When females appear in the film, they do so as passive objects, such as the sexualised flight and <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> attendants; or stripped of their femininity, such as the "<a href="Butch%20and%20femme">butch</a>" Major Iceborg. Stefan Brandt, in the book "Subverting Masculinity", also said that the film "echoes stereotypical beliefs about gender" of all females in the film, including Leeloo, who he thought only left her passive role in the film during her fight with the Mangalores. With the exception of Tiny Lister's portrayal of the President, all males in the film were considered to be as unmanly as possible in various ways, such as Ruby Rhod's effeminacy, Vito Cornelius's clumsy form of speech, and General Munro's stupidity; their purpose was to make Korben's masculinity appear "god-like" by comparison.

In the book "The Films of Luc Besson", Susan Hayward considered "The Fifth Element" to be a classic story of a man "making his break from the tribe, proving his manhood, over-throwing the malevolent forces and killing the chief, finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage". Korben's journey, however, is under threat not only from the Mangalores and Zorg, but also from Leeloo, who relents and helps him only at the last minute, accepting his declaration of love. The love story within "The Fifth Element" was considered to be one of the main narratives in the film, and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline. Hayward also considered the issue of <a href="ecology">environmental damage</a>, in so far as <a href="waste">waste</a> and pollution are visible throughout the film. Whereas <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a>s often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity, "The Films of Luc Besson" included "The Fifth Element" amongst the minority of science fiction films that "hold up a mirror" and show humankind as responsible. The film was said to be skeptical of capitalist <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>, in so far as the gadgets in Zorg's office make an unhealthy obsession of his lust for <a href="technology">technology</a>. The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution.

As a teenager, Besson envisioned the world of "The Fifth Element" in an attempt to alleviate boredom. He began writing the script when he was 16, though it was not released in cinemas until he was 38. The original storyline was set in the year 2300, and was about a "nobody" named Zaltman Bleros (later renamed Korben Dallas) who wins a trip to the <a href="Club%20Med">Club Med</a> resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise. There he meets Leeloo, a "sand-girl" who has the "beauty of youth" despite being over 2,000 years old. Besson continued to work on the storyline for years; by the time his documentary film "<a href="Atlantis%20%281991%20film%29">Atlantis</a>" was released in 1991 he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and <a href="Patrice%20Ledoux">Patrice Ledoux</a> from <a href="Gaumont%20Film%20Company">Gaumont</a> were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while looking for actors for the film, Besson met <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">French comics</a> creators <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean Giraud</a> and <a href="Jean-Claude%20M%C3%A9zi%C3%A8res">Jean-Claude Mézières</a> and recruited them for the film's production design. Giraud and Mézières's comics were a major source of inspiration for Besson's futuristic <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Mézières wrote the book "<a href="The%20Circles%20of%20Power">The Circles of Power</a>", which contains a character named S'Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air traffic of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Five other artists were hired for the project, and <a href="Jean-Paul%20Gaultier">Jean-Paul Gaultier</a> was hired to design the costumes. The team spent a year creating over 8,000 drawings, during which time Besson approached both Bruce Willis and <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> for the lead role. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, "<a href="Hudson%20Hawk">Hudson Hawk</a>" and "<a href="Billy%20Bathgate%20%28film%29">Billy Bathgate</a>", had been received poorly; Gibson eventually turned down the role. While the team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one willing to take on the budget of almost $100 million. In December 1992 production stopped without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.

Besson went on to direct the commercially successful film "", which was released in September 1994. While shooting and releasing "Leon", he continued to work on the script for "The Fifth Element", shortening it and reducing the film's budget to $90 million before attempting to find a studio willing to produce it. <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, who had a partnership in "Leon", agreed to finance the film. By this time Besson had decided to go with a lesser-known lead actor in order to save on production costs. Besson was in <a href="Barry%20Josephson">Barry Josephson</a>'s office when Willis called regarding a different film. Besson asked to speak to Willis "just to say hello", and told him that "The Fifth Element" was finally going ahead, explaining the decision to go with a less-expensive actor. After a short silence, Willis stated "If I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement"; he agreed to take on the role after reading the script. Production commenced in early August 1995. Besson traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London and Rome. He hired Gary Oldman (who had starred in "Léon") for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as "one of the top five actors in the world." For the character Leeloo, Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200 to 300 applicants he met in person. The "Divine Language" spoken by Leeloo is a <a href="fictional%20language">fictional language</a> with only 400 words, invented by Besson. Jovovich and Besson held conversations and wrote letters to each other in the language as practice. Besson was married to <a href="Ma%C3%AFwenn">Maïwenn</a> Le Besco, who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna, when filming commenced; however, he left her for Jovovich during filming. Jovovich and Besson later married, but divorced in 1999.

Wishing to shoot the film in France, Besson could not find suitable facilities and "with a heavy heart" filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> on seven soundstages including the <a href="007%20Stage">007 Stage</a>. Construction of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>. Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>; the first shoot, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, "The Fifth Element" was a French production, and went on to become the costliest European film ever made at the time. The buildings in New York were derived from both <a href="Metabolism%20%28architecture%29">metabolist</a>-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s, and the futuristic designs of architect <a href="Antonio%20Sant%27Elia">Antonio Sant'Elia</a> in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the action shots take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films, and wanted a brighter "cheerfully crazy" look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one. Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as "intellectually <a href="Transgressive%20art">transgressive</a>", were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A single jacket he designed for the film cost $5,000.

The original name of the character Ruby Rhod was Loc Rhod. The name appears in both the original script and in the novelisation of the film. Speculation has been raised that the name change was a play on information in the periodic table. <a href="Rubidium">Rubidium</a> is the first of the <a href="Period%205%20element">Period 5 element</a>s, and exactly halfway down that row is the element <a href="Rhodium">Rhodium</a>. Taking the first half of each element yields "Rubi Rhod". Others have speculated his name is a play on his <a href="gender%20bender">gender bending</a> personality; having a feminine first name and phallic surname.

Three different teams handled the three different types of special effects used in the film. <a href="Nick%20Allder">Nick Allder</a> was placed in charge of mechanical and pyrotechnical effects, <a href="Nick%20Dudman">Nick Dudman</a> was placed in charge of 'creature' effects and <a href="Mark%20Stetson">Mark Stetson</a> headed the visual effects team. Visual effects company <a href="Digital%20Domain">Digital Domain</a> was hired, and <a href="Karen%20Goulekas">Karen Goulekas</a> was given the role of digital effects supervisor. <a href="PowerAnimator">Alias</a>, <a href="Autodesk%20Softimage">Autodesk Softimage</a>, Arete, Side Effect's Prisms, <a href="RenderMan%20%28software%29">RenderMan</a>, as well as in-house software, were used by Digital Domain to create effects. Some individual shots used a combination of <a href="live%20action">live action</a>, <a href="scale%20model">scale model</a>s, <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> and <a href="particle%20system">particle system</a>s. The lanes of traffic in the scenes in New York City were created with particle systems:

Amongst the scale models used for filming were the buildings seen in New York City. Dozens of apartment blocks and 25 skyscrapers, some high, were constructed in 1/24th scale. It took a team of 80 workers five months to build all the models. The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time-consuming tasks, along with details behind the windows, such as furniture, blinds, <a href="lightbox">lightbox</a>es and tiny pieces of flat artwork. Virtual sets built within digital environments were created to enhance the use of miniatures. <a href="Motion%20control%20photography">Motion control camera</a>s moved throughout the scale sets, and the data they collected was exported to track and generate the CG animation and particle systems. Other techniques used included digital <a href="Matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte</a> paintings for backgrounds and the <a href="Non-uniform%20rational%20B-spline">NURBS</a> mathematical model for certain animations, including the sequence in which Leeloo's body is reconstructed.

"The Fifth Element" is one of Besson's films which have been described as "intrinsically musical"; some kind of music is playing during about 90 percent of the film. The <a href="film%20score">score</a> was composed by <a href="%C3%89ric%20Serra">Éric Serra</a>. He relies heavily on the use of orchestral textures, such as the <a href="oboe">oboe</a> and strings heard as the surgeons prepare to regenerate Leeloo, and the <a href="wikt%3Apizzicato">pizzicato</a> as she is reconstructed. Serra also used many exotic influences, such as the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> fanfare heard before the spaceport sequence, the <a href="reggae">reggae</a> piece played in preparation for the flight, and the <a href="hula">hula</a> music that greets the passengers as they arrive in Fhloston. More conventional scoring techniques are present in the <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> that first appears when professor Pacoli mentions the fifth element, the militaristic snares as the warship prepares to attack the dark planet, and the <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahlerian</a> funereal piece heard when Leeloo learns about war. The music used for the taxicab chase scene, titled "Alech Taadi" by Algerian performer <a href="Khaled%20%28musician%29">Khaled</a>, is excluded from the film soundtrack, but is available on Khaled's album "<a href="N%27ssi%20N%27ssi">N'ssi N'ssi</a>".

The Diva Dance opera performance used music from <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Gaetano Donizetti</a>'s "<a href="Lucia%20di%20Lammermoor">Lucia di Lammermoor</a>": "<a href="Il%20dolce%20suono">Il dolce suono</a>", the <a href="mad%20scene">mad scene</a> of Act III, Scene 2. It is one of the few pieces of music in the film that is <a href="diegesis%23Film%20sound%20and%20music">diegetic</a>. It was sung by Albanian <a href="soprano">soprano</a> <a href="Inva%20Mula">Inva Mula</a>, while the role of Plavalaguna was played by French actress Maïwenn Le Besco. Part One (titled "Lucia di Lammermoor") and Part Two (titled "The Diva Dance") of this piece are included as separate tracks on "The Fifth Element" soundtrack, but are sequenced to create the effect of the entire performance seen in the film. The end of Part One blends into the beginning of Part Two, creating a smooth transition between the two tracks.

Released as an album under <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a>, the soundtrack peaked at No. 99 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. More than 200,000 copies of the lengthy soundtrack were sold in France alone. Rodney Batdorf of "<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>" gave the album three out of five stars, stating it was "diverse and accomplished, and it is just as effective outside of the film as it is within it." A review from Filmtracks.com also awarded the album three out of five stars.

The film premiered on 7 May 1997 at the <a href="1997%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1997 Cannes Film Festival</a>, where it was selected as the opening film. <a href="Gaumont%20Film%20Company">Gaumont</a> built an area for the screening that was over . Guests were given a "Fifth Element" <a href="Swatch">Swatch</a>, which was used as their ticket for entry. The event included a futuristic ballet, a fashion show by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and fireworks. Gaumont spent between <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US $</a>1 million and $3 million on the event, a record at the time.

The film debuted at number 1 in the US, earning $17 million on its opening weekend. It went on to become a box-office success, grossing over $263 million, almost three times its budget of $90 million. Seventy-six percent of the receipts for "The Fifth Element" were from markets outside the United States, and it was the ninth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. It was the most successful film at the box office in France in 1997, with more than 7.69 million seeing the film. In Germany the film was awarded the <a href="Goldene%20Leinwand">Goldene Leinwand</a>, a sales certification award for selling more than three million tickets at the box office. "The Fifth Element" went on to become the highest grossing French film at the foreign box-office, a record it held for 16 years until the release of "<a href="The%20Intouchables">The Intouchables</a>" in 2011.

"The Fifth Element" polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described the film as an "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's ""." He concluded that "The Fifth Element" was "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see." On film review show "<a href="At%20the%20Movies%20%281986%20TV%20program%29">At the Movies</a>", both <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> and <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> gave the film a "thumbs up"; in his own review for the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long."

The film was, however, subject to a number of harsh reviews that expressed disapproval of its overblown style. <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote, "A largely misfired European attempt to make an American-style sci-fi spectacular, "The Fifth Element" consists of a hodgepodge of elements that don't comfortably coalesce." David Edelstein of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" was even more critical, saying, "It may or may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is one of the most unhinged."

<a href="Chris%20Tucker">Chris Tucker</a>'s performance as Ruby Rhod also polarised critics. He was praised in the "Los Angeles Times" and in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"; the latter called him "the summer's most outrageous special effect." Josh Winning of "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>", however, singled out Tucker's performance as the low point of the film, ranking it as No. 20 on his 2011 list, "50 Performances That Ruined Movies".

"The Fifth Element" holds a 71% approval rating at <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads: "Visually inventive and gleefully over the top, Luc Besson's "The Fifth Element" is a fantastic piece of pop sci-fi that never takes itself too seriously." It has a weighted score of 52/100 at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, based on 22 professional reviews, indicating "mixed or average" reviews. Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.

The film has been described by <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>, <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, and ComingSoon.com as a science fiction <a href="Cult%20film">cult classic</a>. However film critic <a href="Mark%20Kermode">Mark Kermode</a> reported that "The Fifth Element" was one of the most divisive films among his readers, regarded as both the best and the worst summer blockbuster of all time. Kermode recalled his own experience: "I remember very clearly being in Cannes when "[The] Fifth Element" was first played, and it "really" divided the audience." Stephen Cass of "<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>" ranked the film the third-best science fiction film on subscription service <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>, writing, "People seem to either like or loathe "The Fifth Element "... Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching." In some circles the film has gained a "<a href="Cult%20film">so-bad-it's-good</a>" status; Meredith Woerner of <a href="io9">io9</a> listed "The Fifth Element" as one of "The 20 Best Worst Science Fiction Movies of All Time". In 2007 the <a href="Visual%20Effects%20Society">Visual Effects Society</a> placed "The Fifth Element" at No. 50, tied with "<a href="Darby%20O%27Gill%20and%20the%20Little%20People">Darby O'Gill and the Little People</a>", on their list of the 50 most influential visual effects films of all time. In 2014, "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" listed the film at No. 42 on their "100 best sci-fi movies" list.

Willis spoke favourably of the film in a 1999 interview, concluding "it was a real fun movie to make." Tucker and Jovovich also spoke favourably of both their experiences making the film and working with Besson in interviews on the "Ultimate Edition" DVD; Jovovich described Besson as "the first really amazing director I had worked with". Asked in a 2014 interview if he liked the film, Gary Oldman stated, "Oh no. I can't bear it." He had explained in 2011: "It was me singing for my supper because Luc had come in and partly financed [my film] "<a href="Nil%20by%20Mouth%20%28film%29">Nil by Mouth</a>"."

<a href="Alejandro%20Jodorowsky">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> and <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean Giraud</a> sued Besson after the film was released, claiming "The Fifth Element" had plagiarised their comic "<a href="The%20Incal">The Incal</a>". Giraud sued for 13.1 million euros for unfair competition, 9 million euros in damages and interest and two to five percent of the net operating revenues of the film. Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros. The case was dismissed in 2004 on the grounds that only "tiny fragments" of the comic had been used and also because Giraud had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.

A novel adaptation of "The Fifth Element", written by <a href="Terry%20Bisson">Terry Bisson</a>, was published by <a href="HarperPrism">HarperPrism</a> in 1997. There were rumors after the film's release that it would be followed by a sequel, tentatively titled "Mr. Shadow". In 2011, Besson stated that a sequel was never planned, and that he has no desire to make one.

A <a href="The%20Fifth%20Element%20%28video%20game%29">video game adaptation</a> of "The Fifth Element" was created by <a href="Activision">Activision</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> game console and <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> in 1998. The PlayStation version was generally met with negative reviews, though the PC version was better received. Lauren Fielder from "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" called the PlayStation version "quite possibly the worst game I've ever played." Doug Perry from "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" commented: "Take "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>", add in Leeloo Multipass and boring puzzles, and you've got "Fifth Element"." A racing game based on the film, "<a href="New%20York%20Race">New York Race</a>", was released in 2001. "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" gave the game 6 out of 10, concluding: ""New York Race" is a fun little arcade racer which oozes style, but it's something you'll grow tired of extremely quickly and as such remains fun only in short bursts."

The original home video release of "The Fifth Element" took place in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> on 10 December 1997, on VHS, <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, and DVD. The original DVD presented the film in its original 2.39:1 <a href="anamorphic%20widescreen">anamorphic widescreen</a> format though carried no special features. The film was released in Sony's <a href="Superbit">Superbit</a> format in October 2001. In his review, Conrad Jeremy from "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" gave the picture quality of the original DVD release 9 out of 10, though awarded the Superbit version a perfect score for picture quality. Overall the Superbit version was given 8 out of 10; the final score was brought down by the version's complete lack of special features.

An "Ultimate Edition" set of two DVDs was released on 11 January 2005. The only difference between the Superbit version and the Ultimate Edition disc one is the addition of a "fact track", which when turned on displays trivia about the film, cast and crew as the film plays. The second disc provides various special features, focusing on visual production, special effects, fashion in the film, <a href="featurette">featurette</a>s and interviews with Willis, Jovovich, and Tucker, as well as featurettes on the four different alien races in the film and Diva Plavalaguna. Ian Jane of "<a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a>" praised the Ultimate Edition for its special features.

The first <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> release of the film on 20 June 2006 was criticised as having poor picture quality by Blu-ray standards, and for its lack of special features. In what has been called "an extremely rare move" Sony responded to complaints by making a remastered Blu-ray version available, released on 17 July 2007, and also offered a replacement exchange program for customers unhappy with the original Blu-ray release. Ben Williams from Blu-ray.com stated the remastered version "absolutely" made up for the substandard initial release and praised its high video and audio quality; however, he criticised the continued lack of special features.

The 20th anniversary <a href="4K%20resolution">4K</a> remaster was released on <a href="Ultra%20HD%20Blu-ray">Ultra HD Blu-ray</a> on July 11, 2017.

Battle of Shiloh

The Battle of Shiloh (also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing) was a battle in the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western Theater</a> of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, fought April 6–7, 1862, in southwestern <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. A <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> force known as the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a> (<a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>) had moved via the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at <a href="Pittsburg%20Landing%2C%20Tennessee">Pittsburg Landing</a> on the west bank of the Tennessee River, where the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> <a href="Army%20of%20Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a> (<a href="General%20%28CSA%29">General</a> <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>, <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a> second-in-command) launched a surprise attack on Grant's army from its base in <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>. Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening. Overnight, Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Army of the Ohio</a> (Maj. Gen. <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>). The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day.

On April 6, the first day of the battle, the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west. Johnston hoped to defeat Grant's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio. The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting, and Grant's men instead fell back to the northeast, in the direction of Pittsburg Landing. A Union position on a slightly sunken road, nicknamed the "Hornet's Nest" and defended by the divisions of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gens.</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Prentiss">Benjamin Prentiss</a> and <a href="W.%20H.%20L.%20Wallace">William H. L. Wallace</a>, provided time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries. Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed, while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered. Johnston was shot in the leg and bled to death while leading an attack. Beauregard acknowledged how tired the army was from the day's exertions and decided against assaulting the final Union position that night. 

Tired but unfought and well-organized men from Buell's army and a division of Grant's army arrived in the evening of April 6 and helped turn the tide the next morning, when the Union commanders launched a counterattack along the entire line. Confederate forces were forced to retreat, ending their hopes of blocking the Union advance into northern <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. The Battle of Shiloh was the battle with the highest number of casualties in <a href="American%20history">American history</a> until the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stones%20River">Battle of Stones River</a>, which was surpassed by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> the next year and soon after, by the three-day <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, the highest-casualty battle of the war.

After the losses of <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Fort Henry</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> in February 1862, Confederate <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">General</a> <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> to reorganize. Johnston established his base at <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, the site of a <a href="Memphis%20and%20Charleston%20Railroad">major railroad</a> junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River.

In early March, Union Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20W.%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>, then commander of the Department of the Missouri, ordered Grant to remain at Fort Henry, and on March 4 turned field command of the expedition over to a subordinate, Brig. Gen. <a href="Charles%20Ferguson%20Smith">C. F. Smith</a>, who had recently been nominated as a major general. (Various writers assert that Halleck took this step because of professional and personal animosity toward Grant; however, Halleck shortly restored Grant to full command, perhaps influenced by an inquiry from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.) Smith's orders were to lead raids intended to capture or damage the railroads in southwestern Tennessee. Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>'s troops arrived from <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah, Kentucky</a>, to conduct a similar mission to break the railroads near Eastport, Mississippi. Halleck also ordered Grant to advance his <a href="Army%20of%20West%20Tennessee">Army of West Tennessee</a> (soon to be known by its more famous name, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a>) on an invasion up the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a>. Grant left Fort Henry and headed upriver (south), arriving at <a href="Savannah%2C%20Tennessee">Savannah, Tennessee</a>, on March 14, and established his headquarters on the east bank of the river. Grant's troops set up camp farther upriver: five divisions at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and a sixth at Crump's Landing, four miles from Grant's headquarters.

Meanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged through consolidation of Grant's and Buell's armies and renamed the Department of the Mississippi. With Buell's Army of the Ohio under his command, Halleck ordered Buell to concentrate with Grant at Savannah. Buell began a march with much of his army from <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, and headed southwest toward Savannah. Halleck intended to take the field in person and lead both armies in an advance south to seize Corinth, Mississippi, where the <a href="Mobile%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Mobile and Ohio Railroad</a> linking <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, to the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> intersected the <a href="Memphis%20%26amp%3B%20Charleston%20Railroad">Memphis and Charleston Railroad</a>. The railroad was a vital supply line connecting the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a> to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>.

Maj. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a> of 44,895 men consisted of six divisions:

Of the six divisions encamped on the western side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being more concerned with his own plans than with those of the enemy. His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most consequential lack of such concern—his army was spread out in <a href="Military%20camp">bivouac</a> style, with many of his men surrounding a small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.

In his memoirs, Grant reacted to criticism of his lack of entrenchments: "Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill more than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications." Lew Wallace's division was downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about to the south.

The portion of Maj. Gen. <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Army of the Ohio</a> that was engaged in the battle consisted of four divisions:

On April 5, the eve of battle, the first of Buell's divisions, under the command of Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20%26quot%3BBull%26quot%3B%20Nelson">William "Bull" Nelson</a>, reached Savannah. Grant instructed Nelson to encamp there instead of immediately crossing the river. The remainder of Buell's army, still marching toward Savannah with only portions of four of his divisions, totaling 17,918 men, did not reach the area in time to have a significant role in the battle until its second day. Buell's three other divisions were led by Brig. Gens. <a href="Alexander%20McDowell%20McCook">Alexander M. McCook</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas L. Crittenden</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Wood">Thomas J. Wood</a>. (Wood's division appeared too late even to be of much service on the second day.)

On the Confederate side, Albert S. Johnston named his newly assembled force the <a href="Army%20of%20Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a>. The 59-year old Johnston was one of the most experienced officers on either side at this point in the war, having participated in five different wars for three different nations during a military career that covered 34 years. <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> once said "If Johnston is not a general, then we have no general." He concentrated almost 55,000 men around <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, about southwest of Grant's troops at Pittsburg Landing. Of these men, 40,335 departed from Corinth on April 3, hoping to surprise Grant before Buell arrived to join forces. They were organized into four large corps, commanded by:


On the eve of battle, Grant's and Johnston's armies were of comparable size, but the Confederates were poorly armed with antique weapons, including shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, flintlock muskets, and even a few <a href="pike%20%28weapon%29">pikes</a>; however, some regiments, such as the 6th and 7th Kentucky Infantry, had <a href="Pattern%201853%20Enfield">Enfield</a> rifles. The troops approached the battle with very little combat experience; Braxton Bragg's men from Pensacola and Mobile were the best trained. Grant's army included 32 out of 62 infantry regiments who had combat experience at Fort Donelson. One half of his artillery batteries and most of his cavalry were also combat veterans.

Johnston's plan was to attack Grant's left, separate the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units to get lost in the woods and others to grind to a halt faced with heavy traffic jams. It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. Instead, it would happen on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to reinforce Grant on the second day. Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out of rations by the time the battle commenced.

During the Confederate march, there were several minor skirmishes with Union scouts and both sides had taken prisoners. Furthermore, many Confederate troops failed to maintain proper noise discipline as the army prepared for the attack. Positioned only a few miles from the Union Army, the rebel soldiers routinely played their bugles, pounded their drums, and even discharged their muskets hunting for game. As a result, Johnston's second in command, <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a>, feared that the element of surprise had been lost and recommended withdrawing to Corinth, believing that by the time the battle commenced, they would be facing an enemy "entrenched up to the eyes". He was also concerned about the lack of rations, fearing that if the army got into prolonged engagement, their meager remaining food supplies would not be able to sustain them. But Johnston once more refused to consider retreat.

Johnston made the decision to attack, stating "I would fight them if they were a million." Despite Beauregard's well-founded concern, most of the Union forces did not hear the marching army approach and were unaware of the enemy camps less than away.

Before 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 6, Johnston's army was deployed for battle, straddling the Corinth Road. The army had spent the entire night making a camp in order of battle within of the Union camp near Sherman's headquarters at Shiloh Church. Despite several contacts, a few minor skirmishes with Union forces, and the failure of the army to maintain proper noise discipline in the days leading up to the 6th, their approach and dawn assault achieved a strategic and tactical surprise. Grant wanted to avoid provoking any major battles until the linkup with Buell's Army of the Ohio was complete. Thus the Union army had sent out no scouts or regular patrols and did not have any <a href="vedette%20%28sentry%29">vedettes</a> in place for early warning, concerned that scouts and patrols might provoke a major battle before the Army of the Ohio finished crossing the river. Grant telegraphed a message to Halleck on the night of April 5, "I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack (general one) being made upon us, but will be prepared should such a thing take place." Grant's declaration proved to be overstated. Sherman, the informal camp commander at Pittsburg Landing, did not believe the Confederates had a major assault force nearby; he discounted the possibility of an attack from the south. Sherman expected that Johnston would eventually attack from the direction of <a href="Purdy%2C%20Tennessee">Purdy, Tennessee</a>, to the west. When Col. Jesse Appler, 53rd Ohio Infantry, warned Sherman that an attack was imminent, the general angrily replied, "Take your damned regiment back to Ohio. There are no Confederates closer than Corinth."

Around 3 a.m., Col. <a href="Everett%20Peabody">Everett Peabody</a>, commanding Brig. Gen. Benjamin Prentiss's 1st Brigade, sent a patrol of 250 infantry men from the 25th Missouri and the 12th Michigan out on reconnaissance patrol, convinced that the constant reports of Confederate contacts over the last few days meant there was a strong possibility of a large confederate force in the area. The patrol, under the command of Maj. James E. Powell, met fire from Confederates who then fled into the woods. A short time later, 5:15 a.m., they encountered Confederate outposts manned by the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, and a spirited fight lasted about an hour. Arriving messengers and sounds of gunfire from the skirmish alerted the nearest Union troops, who formed battle line positions before the Confederates were able to reach them; however, the Union army command had not adequately prepared for an attack on their camps. When Prentiss learned that Peabody had sent out a patrol without his authorization he was outraged and accused the Colonel of provoking a major engagement in violation of Grant's orders, but he soon realized he was facing an assault by an entire Confederate army and rushed to prepare his men for defense. By 9 a.m. Union forces at Pittsburg Landing were either engaged or moving toward the front line. Both Peabody and Powell were soon killed in the subsequent fighting.

The confusing alignment of the Confederate army helped reduce the effectiveness of the attack, since Johnston and Beauregard had no unified battle plan. Earlier, Johnston had telegraphed <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> his plan for the attack: "Polk the left, Bragg the center, Hardee the right, Breckinridge in reserve." His strategy was to emphasize the attack on his right flank to prevent the Union army from reaching the Tennessee River, its supply line and avenue of retreat. Johnston instructed Beauregard to stay in the rear and direct men and supplies as needed, while he rode to the front to lead the men on the battle line. This effectively ceded control of the battle to Beauregard, who had a different concept, which was simply to attack in three waves and push the Union army eastward to the river. The corps of Hardee and Bragg began the assault with their divisions in one line, nearly wide and about from its front to its rear column. As these units advanced, they became intermingled and difficult to control. Corps commanders attacked in line without reserves, and artillery could not be concentrated to effect a breakthrough. At about 7:30 a.m., from his position in the rear, Beauregard ordered the corps of Polk and Breckinridge forward on the left and right of the line, diluting their effectiveness. The attack therefore went forward as a <a href="frontal%20assault">frontal assault</a> conducted by a single linear formation, which lacked both the depth and weight needed for success. Units marching through rough uneven terrain were unable to maintain formation integrity and ended up mixing together with regiments from other commands. Generals ended up having to take command of zones of the battlefield rather than their own assigned divisions. Command and control, in the modern sense, were lost from the onset of the first assault.

The Confederate assault, despite its shortcomings, was ferocious, causing some of the numerous inexperienced Union soldiers in Grant's new army to flee to the river for safety. Others fought well, but were forced to withdraw under strong pressure from the Confederates, and attempted to form new defensive lines. Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, became one of its most important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides. Sherman received two minor wounds and had three horses shot out from under him. Historian <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> cites the battle as the turning point of Sherman's life, helping him to become one of the North's premier generals. Sherman's division bore the brunt of the initial attack. Despite heavy fire on their position and their left flank crumbling, Sherman's men fought stubbornly, but the Union troops slowly lost ground and fell back to a position behind Shiloh Church. <a href="John%20Alexander%20McClernand">McClernand</a>'s division temporarily stabilized the position. Overall, however, Johnston's forces made steady progress until noon, rolling up Union positions one by one. As the Confederates advanced, many threw away their flintlock muskets and grabbed rifles dropped by the fleeing Union troops.

By 11:00 am, the Confederate advance began to slow down, due to stiff Union resistance, but also due to disciplinary problems as the army overran the Federal camps. The sight of fresh food still burning on camp fires proved too tempting for many hungry Confederates, and many broke ranks to pillage and loot the camps, putting the army on hold until their officers could get them back into line. Johnston himself ended up personally intervening to help prevent the looting and get his army back on track. Riding into the Union camp, he took a single tin cup and announced "Let this be my share of the spoils today," before directing his army onward.

Grant was about downriver at Savannah, Tennessee, when he heard the sound of artillery fire. (On April 4, he had been injured when his horse fell and pinned him underneath. He was convalescing and unable to move without crutches.) Before leaving Savannah, Grant ordered Bull Nelson's division to march along the east side of the river, to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, where it could be ferried over to the battlefield. Grant then took his steamboat, "Tigress", to Crump's Landing, where he gave Lew Wallace his first orders, which were to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, arriving about 8:30 a.m.; most of the day went by before the first of these reinforcements arrived. (Nelson's division arrived around 5 p.m.; Wallace's appeared about 7 p.m.) Wallace's slow movement to the battlefield would become particularly controversial.

On the morning of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30 a.m., Grant's flagship stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30 a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, a move that would have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained that he was not ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).

Around noon, Wallace began the journey along the Shunpike, a route familiar to his men. A member of Grant's staff, <a href="William%20R.%20Rowley">William R. Rowley</a>, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30 p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was and why he had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have found himself in the rear of the advancing Confederate troops.

Wallace had to make a choice: he could launch an attack and fight through the Confederate rear to reach Grant's forces closer to Pittsburg Landing, or reverse his direction and march toward Pittsburg Landing via a crossroads to the River Road. Wallace chose the second option. (After the war, Wallace claimed that his division might have attacked and defeated the Confederates if his advance had not been interrupted, but later conceded that the move would not have been successful.) Rather than realign his troops so the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops to maintain the original order, only facing in the other direction. The move further delayed Wallace's troops as they marched north along the Shunpike road, then took a crossover to reach the River Road to the east, and headed south toward the battlefield.

Wallace's division began arriving at Grant's position about 6:30 p.m., after a march of about in seven hours over poor and muddy roads. It formed line on the battlefield about 7 p.m., when the fighting was nearly over for the day. Although Grant showed no disapproval at the time, his later endorsement of Wallace's battle report was negative enough to severely damage Wallace's military career. Today, Wallace is better remembered as the author of "".

On the main Union defensive line, starting around 9 a.m., Prentiss's and W. H. L. Wallace's divisions established and held a position nicknamed the "Hornet's Nest", in a field along a road, now popularly called the "Sunken Road," although there is little physical justification for that name. The Confederates assaulted the position for several hours rather than simply bypassing it, and suffered heavy casualties. Historians' estimates of the number of separate charges range from 8 to 14. The Union forces to the left and right of the Nest were forced back, making Prentiss's position a prominent point in the line. Coordination within the Nest was poor, and units withdrew based solely on their individual commanders' decisions. The pressure increased when W. H. L. Wallace, commander of the largest concentration of troops in the position, was mortally wounded while attempting to lead a breakout from the Confederate encirclement. Union regiments became disorganized and companies disintegrated as the Confederates, led by Brig. Gen. <a href="Daniel%20Ruggles">Daniel Ruggles</a>, assembled more than 50 cannons into "Ruggles's Battery", the largest concentration of artillery ever assembled in North America up to that point, to blast the line at close range. Confederates surrounded the Hornet's Nest, and it fell after holding out for seven hours. Prentiss surrendered himself and the remains of his division to the Confederates. A large portion of the Union survivors, an estimated 2,200 to 2,400 men, were captured, but their sacrifice bought time for Grant to establish a final defense line near Pittsburg Landing.

While dealing with the Hornet's Nest, the South suffered a serious setback with the death of their commanding general. Albert Sidney Johnston had received a report from Breckenridge that one of his brigades was refusing orders to advance against a Union force in a peach orchard. Quickly rushing to the scene, Johnston was able to rally the men to make the charge by leading it personally, and was mortally wounded at about 2:30 p.m. as he led the attacks on the Union left through the Widow Bell's cotton field against the Peach Orchard. Johnston was shot in his right leg, behind the knee. Deeming the wound insignificant (possibly due to a wound he received 25 years earlier that had inflicted permanent nerve damage preventing him from feeling how bad his injury was), Johnston continued on leading the battle.

Eventually, Johnston's staff members noticed him slumping in his saddle. One of them, Tennessee governor <a href="Isham%20Harris">Isham Harris</a>, asked Johnston if he was wounded, and the general replied "Yes, and I fear seriously." Earlier in the battle, Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners, and there was no medical staff at his current location. An aide helped him off his horse and laid him down under a tree, then went to fetch his surgeon, but did not apply a <a href="tourniquet">tourniquet</a> to Johnston's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston bled to death from a torn <a href="popliteal%20artery">popliteal artery</a> that caused internal bleeding and blood to collect unnoticed in his riding boot. Jefferson Davis considered Johnston to be the most effective general they had (this was two months before <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> emerged as the preeminent Confederate general). Johnston was the highest-ranking officer from either side to be killed in combat during the Civil War. Beauregard assumed command, but his position in the rear, where he relied on field reports from his subordinates, may have given him only a vague idea of the disposition of forces at the front. Beauregard ordered Johnston's body shrouded for secrecy to avoid lowering morale and resumed attacks against the Hornet's Nest. This was likely a tactical error, because the Union flanks were slowly pulling back to form a semicircular line around Pittsburg Landing. If Beauregard had concentrated his forces against the flanks, he might have defeated the Union army at the landing, and then reduced the Hornet's Nest position at his leisure.

The Union flanks were being pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the direction of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. <a href="David%20Stuart%20%28Michigan%20politician%29">David Stuart</a> and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates paused to regroup and recover from exhaustion and disorganization, then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5 km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. <a href="Jacob%20Ammen">Jacob Ammen</a>'s brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line. The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons and naval guns from the river (the gunboats <a href="USS%20Lexington%20%281861%29">USS "Lexington"</a> and <a href="USS%20Tyler%20%281857%29">USS "Tyler"</a>). A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break through the line but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set. The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river where he could be re-enforced and resupplied, not cut him off from his supply lines by forcing him west into the swamps in accordance with the original battle plan.

The evening of April 6 was a dispiriting end to the first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps throughout the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats "Lexington" and "Tyler", it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.

In his 1885 memoirs, Grant described his experience that night:

A famous anecdote encapsulates Grant's unflinching attitude to temporary setbacks and his tendency for offensive action. Sometime after midnight, Sherman encountered Grant standing under a tree, sheltering himself from the pouring rain and smoking one of his cigars, while considering his losses and planning for the next day. Sherman remarked, "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" Grant looked up. "Yes," he replied, followed by a puff. "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though."

Beauregard sent a telegram to President Davis announcing a complete victory. He later admitted, "I thought I had Grant just where I wanted him and could finish him up in the morning." Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.; Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.
Beauregard caused considerable historical controversy with his decision to halt the assault at dusk. Braxton Bragg and Albert Sidney Johnston's son, Col. William Preston Johnston, were among those who bemoaned the so-called "lost opportunity at Shiloh." Beauregard did not come to the front to inspect the strength of the Union lines; he remained at Shiloh Church. He also discounted intelligence reports from Col. <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a> (and bluster from <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> General Prentiss) that Buell's men were crossing the river to reinforce Grant. In defense of his decision, Beauregard's troops were simply exhausted, there was less than an hour of daylight left, and Grant's artillery advantage was formidable. In addition, he had received a dispatch from Brig. Gen. <a href="Benjamin%20Hardin%20Helm">Benjamin Hardin Helm</a> in northern Alabama that indicated Buell was marching toward <a href="Decatur%2C%20Alabama">Decatur</a> and not Pittsburg Landing.

On Monday morning, April 7, the combined Union armies numbered 45,000 men. The Confederates had suffered as many as 8,500 casualties the first day and their commanders reported no more than 20,000 effectives due to stragglers and deserters. (Buell disputed that figure after the war, stating that there were 28,000). The Confederates had withdrawn south into Prentiss's and Sherman's former camps, while Polk's corps retired to the Confederate bivouac established on April 5, which was southwest of Pittsburg Landing. No line of battle was formed, and few if any commands were resupplied with ammunition. The soldiers were consumed by the need to locate food, water, and shelter for a much-needed night's rest.

Beauregard, unaware that he was now outnumbered, planned to continue the attack and drive Grant into the river. To his surprise, Union forces started moving forward in a massive counterattack at dawn. Grant and Buell launched their attacks separately; coordination occurred only at the division level. Lew Wallace's division was the first to see action, about 5:30 a.m., at the extreme right of the Union line. Wallace continued the advance, crossing Tilghman Branch around 7 a.m. and met little resistance. Changing direction and moving to the southwest, Wallace's men drove back the brigade of Col. <a href="Preston%20Pond%2C%20Jr.">Preston Pond</a>. On Wallace's left were the survivors of Sherman's division, then McClernand's, and W. H. L. Wallace's (now under the command of Col. <a href="James%20M.%20Tuttle">James M. Tuttle</a>). Buell's army continued to the left with Bull Nelson's, Crittenden's, and McCook's divisions. The Confederate defenders were so badly commingled that little unit cohesion existed above the brigade level. It required more than two hours to locate Gen. Polk and bring up his division from its bivouac to the southwest. By 10 a.m., Beauregard had stabilized his front with his corps commanders from left to right: Bragg, Polk, Breckinridge, and Hardee. In a thicket near the Hamburg-Purdy Road, the fighting was so intense that Sherman described in his report of the battle "the severest musketry fire I ever heard."

On the Union left, Nelson's division led the advance, followed closely by Crittenden's and McCook's men, down the Corinth and Hamburg-Savannah roads. After heavy fighting, Crittenden's division recaptured the Hornet's Nest area by late morning, but the Crittenden and Nelson forces were repulsed by determined counterattacks from Breckinridge. Wallace's and Sherman's men on the Union right made steady progress, driving Bragg and Polk to the south. As Crittenden and McCook resumed their attacks, Breckinridge was forced to retire. By noon Beauregard's line paralleled the Hamburg-Purdy Road.

In early afternoon, Beauregard launched a series of counterattacks from the Shiloh Church area, aiming to control the Corinth Road. The Union right was temporarily driven back by these assaults at Water Oaks Pond. Crittenden, reinforced by Tuttle, seized the junction of the Hamburg-Purdy and East Corinth roads, driving the Confederates into Prentiss's old camps. Nelson resumed his attack and seized the heights overlooking Locust Grove Branch by late afternoon. Beauregard's final counterattack was <a href="flanking%20maneuver">flanked</a> and repulsed when Grant moved Col. <a href="James%20C.%20Veatch">James C. Veatch</a>'s brigade forward.

Realizing that he had lost the initiative, was low on ammunition and food, and had more than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly , but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark. The battle was over.

For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's decision not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act could have been the unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.

On April 8, Grant sent Sherman south along the Corinth Road on a reconnaissance in force to confirm that the Confederates had retreated, or if they were regrouping to resume their attacks. Grant's army lacked the large organized cavalry units that would have been better suited for reconnaissance and vigorous pursuit of a retreating enemy. Sherman marched with two infantry brigades from his division, along with two battalions of cavalry, and met Brig. Gen. <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Wood">Thomas J. Wood</a>'s division of Buell's army. Six miles (10 km) southwest of Pittsburg Landing, Sherman's men came upon a clear field in which an extensive camp was erected, including a Confederate field hospital. The camp was protected by 300 troopers of Confederate cavalry, commanded by Col. <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>. The road approaching the field was covered by fallen trees for more than .

As skirmishers from the <a href="77th%20Ohio%20Infantry">77th Ohio Infantry</a> approached, having difficulty clearing the fallen timber, Forrest ordered a charge. The wild melee, with Confederate troops firing shotguns and revolvers and brandishing sabers, nearly resulted in Forrest's capture. As Col. Jesse Hildebrand's brigade began forming in line of battle, the Southern troopers started to retreat at the sight of the strong force, and Forrest, who was well in advance of his men, came within a few yards of the Union soldiers before realizing he was all alone. Sherman's men yelled out, "Kill him! Kill him and his horse!" A Union soldier shoved his musket into Forrest's side and fired, striking him above the hip, penetrating to near the spine. Although he was seriously wounded, Forrest was able to stay on horseback and escape; he survived both the wound and the war. The Union lost about 100 men, most of them captured during Forrest's charge, in an incident that has been remembered with the name "Fallen Timbers". After capturing the Confederate field hospital, Sherman encountered the rear of Breckinridge's covering force, but determined the enemy was making no signs of renewing its attack and withdrew back to the Union camps.

In his memoirs, Grant intimated that

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Northern newspapers vilified Grant for his performance during the battle on April 6, especially for being surprised and unprepared. Reporters, many far from the battle, spread the story that Grant had been drunk, falsely alleging that this had resulted in many of his men being <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>ed in their tents because of a lack of defensive preparedness. Despite the Union victory, Grant's reputation suffered in Northern public opinion. Many credited Buell with taking control of the broken Union forces and leading them to victory on April 7. Calls for Grant's removal overwhelmed the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. President Lincoln replied with one of his most famous quotations about Grant: "I can't spare this man; he fights." Although all of the Union division commanders fought well, Sherman emerged as an immediate hero after Grant and Halleck commended him especially. His steadfastness under fire and amid chaos atoned for his previous melancholy and his defensive lapses preceding the battle.
Army officers that were with Grant gave a starkly different account of his capacity, and performance, than those of enterprising newspaper reporters far away from Grant during the battle. One such officer, Colonel William R. Rowley, answering a letter of inquiry about allegations aimed at Grant, maintained:
In retrospect, however, Grant is recognized positively for the clear judgment he was able to retain under the strenuous circumstances, and his ability to perceive the larger tactical picture that ultimately resulted in victory on the second day. For the rest of his life, Grant would insist he always had the battle well under control and rejected claims from critics that only the death of Johnston and arrival of Buell's Army prevented his defeat. In his 1885 memoirs, he wrote:

Grant's career suffered temporarily in the aftermath of Shiloh; Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Beauregard remained in command of the Army of Mississippi and led it back to Corinth. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck advanced slowly toward Corinth and took it in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Corinth">Siege of Corinth</a>, while an amphibious force on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> destroyed the Confederate <a href="River%20Defense%20Fleet">River Defense Fleet</a> and captured <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies and with his departure to the East, Grant was restored to command. The Union forces eventually pushed down the Mississippi River to besiege <a href="Vicksburg%20Campaign">Vicksburg</a>, Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Hudson">Port Hudson</a> in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River came under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two.

Davis was outraged at Beauregard for withdrawing from Corinth without a fight, even though he faced an army nearly twice his size and his water supplies in the city had become contaminated. Shortly after the fall of Corinth, Beauregard took medical leave without receiving authorization from Davis. This was the final straw for Davis, who quickly reassigned him to oversee the coastal defenses in South Carolina. Command of the Army of Mississippi fell to Braxton Bragg, who was promoted to full general on April 6 and during the fall of 1862, he led it on an abortive invasion of Kentucky, culminating in his retreat from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a>.

The Union General Lew Wallace was heavily criticized for failing to get his division into the battle until 1830 hours, near the end of combat on the first day. He was removed from the Army of the Tennessee and never again received a front line command or took part in a big offensive operation, though his backwater assignments still placed him in important battles. Shortly after Shiloh, he was sent to the War Department in Ohio where he led the successful <a href="Defense%20of%20Cincinnati">Defense of Cincinnati</a> during Bragg's invasion of Kentucky. In 1864, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monocacy">Battle of Monocacy</a>, Wallace commanded a 5,800 man force to oppose <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s 14,000-man invasion of Maryland. Faced against an army more than twice his size, Wallace was eventually forced to retreat to Baltimore, but his men delayed Early's advance for a full day, enabling Union re-enforcement to be brought up to protect Washington D.C. Despite this success and later fame for writing the book "", criticism of Wallace's conduct at Shiloh would haunt him for the rest of his life and he would spend much of it trying to defend his actions there.

The two-day battle of Shiloh, the costliest in American history up to that time, resulted in the defeat of the Confederate army and frustration of Johnston's plans to prevent the two Union armies in Tennessee from joining together. Union casualties were 13,047 (1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded, and 2,885 missing); Grant's army bore the brunt of the fighting over the two days, with casualties of 1,513 killed, 6,601 wounded, and 2,830 missing or captured. Confederate casualties were 10,699 (1,728 killed, 8,012 wounded, and 959 missing or captured). The dead included the Confederate army's commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, as well as Brigadier General <a href="Adley%20H.%20Gladden">Adley H. Gladden</a>. The highest ranking Union general killed was <a href="W.%20H.%20L.%20Wallace">W. H. L. Wallace</a>. Union Colonel <a href="Everett%20Peabody">Everett Peabody</a>, whose decision to send out a patrol the morning of the battle may have saved the Union from disaster, was also among the dead. Both sides were shocked at the carnage, which resulted in more than four times as many casualties as the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Battle of Bull Run</a> that had horrified the nation 10 months earlier.

Three more years of such bloodshed remained and eight larger and bloodier battles were yet to come. Grant later came to realize that his prediction of one great battle bringing the war to a close would probably not occur. The war would continue, at great cost in casualties and resources, until the Confederacy succumbed or the Union was divided. Grant also learned a valuable personal lesson on preparedness that (mostly) served him well for the rest of the war. 

The loss of Albert Johnston was a particularly severe blow to the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis called it "the turning point of our fate." For the remainder of the war, the Confederate armies in the West would go through a long string of commanders, much like the Union in the east, as Davis searched for a leader who was the caliber of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>.

In addition to those already mentioned, several other famous people participated in the Battle of Shiloh


Shiloh's importance as a Civil War battle, coupled with the lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development as one of the first five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved. Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The <a href="Civil%20War%20Trust">Civil War Trust</a> (a division of the <a href="American%20Battlefield%20Trust">American Battlefield Trust</a>) became the primary agent of these efforts, joining federal, state and local partners to acquire and preserve of the battlefield in more than 25 different acquisitions since 1996. Much of the acreage has been sold or conveyed to the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> and incorporated into the <a href="Shiloh%20National%20Military%20Park">Shiloh National Military Park</a>. The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank on day one and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.

The United States Postal Service released a commemorative stamp on the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Shiloh, first issued through the Shiloh, Tennessee, Post Office on April 7, 1962. It was the second in a marking the Civil War Centennial.

The writer <a href="Ambrose%20Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a> was at Shiloh as sergeant-major of the <a href="9th%20Indiana%20Infantry%20Regiment">9th Indiana Infantry Regiment</a>. He recalled his experiences in the essay "What I Saw of Shiloh", written in 1874 and twice revised in the following 35 years. He describes Pittsburg Landing as follows: "Here in 1862 were some fields and a house or two; now there are a national cemetery and other improvements." Some scholars think 'What I Saw of Shiloh' is Bierce's best work.

The song "Shiloh's Hill" was written shortly after the battle and soon became a popular civil war tune.

The Battle of Shiloh was depicted in the 1962 film "<a href="How%20the%20West%20Was%20Won%20%28film%29">How the West Was Won</a>", directed by <a href="John%20Ford">John Ford</a>.

<a href="Shel%20Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a> wrote "In the Hills of Shiloh", a poignant song about widowed bride forever awaiting the return of a man killed in the battle of Shiloh. The song was recorded by <a href="The%20New%20Christy%20Minstrels">The New Christy Minstrels</a>, <a href="Judy%20Collins">Judy Collins</a>, and others.

In <a href="Frederick%20Forsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a>'s 1999 novel "<a href="The%20Phantom%20of%20Manhattan">The Phantom of Manhattan</a>", one of the main plots is of the <a href="Erik%20%28The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%29">Phantom</a> composing an opera set during the battle called "The Angel of Shiloh".

In 2011, the American Celtic punk band <a href="Dropkick%20Murphys">Dropkick Murphys</a> included a song lamenting the heavy casualties taken by Irish units at Shiloh on their album "<a href="Going%20Out%20in%20Style">Going Out in Style</a>" entitled "Broken Hymns."

The Battle of Shiloh was depicted in the wargame "Bloody April: The Battle of Shiloh, 1862", published in 1979 by <a href="Simulation%20Publications">Simulation Publications</a> Inc. (SPI).

In May 2016, "Bloody April", a computer game based on the SPI title was released by HexWar Games, Ltd. (Scotland), for iPhone/iPad/Mac platforms. This single-player game (with a computer opponent) presents several scenarios covering the two-day battle.

Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc (; 7 January 189930 January 1963) was a French composer and pianist. His compositions include "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>s", solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite "<a href="Trois%20mouvements%20perp%C3%A9tuels">Trois mouvements perpétuels</a>" (1919), the ballet "<a href="Les%20biches">Les biches</a>" (1923), the "<a href="Concert%20champ%C3%AAtre">Concert champêtre</a>" (1928) for <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a> and orchestra, the <a href="Organ%20Concerto%20%28Poulenc%29">Organ Concerto</a> (1938), the opera "<a href="Dialogues%20des%20Carm%C3%A9lites">Dialogues des Carmélites</a>" (1957), and the "<a href="Gloria%20%28Poulenc%29">Gloria</a>" (1959) for <a href="soprano">soprano</a>, choir and orchestra.

As the only son of a prosperous manufacturer Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist <a href="Ricardo%20Vi%C3%B1es">Ricardo Viñes</a>, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came under the influence of <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>, under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as "<a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a>". In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.

In addition to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the <a href="baritone">baritone</a> <a href="Pierre%20Bernac">Pierre Bernac</a> (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano <a href="Denise%20Duval">Denise Duval</a>, touring in Europe and America with each, and making many recordings. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the <a href="phonograph">gramophone</a>, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.

In his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more attention has been given to his serious works, with many new productions of "Dialogues des Carmélites" and "<a href="La%20voix%20humaine">La voix humaine</a>" worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.

Poulenc was born in the <a href="8th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">8th arrondissement of Paris</a>, the younger child and only son of Émile Poulenc and his wife, Jenny, "née" Royer. Émile Poulenc was a joint owner of the <a href="Poulenc%20Fr%C3%A8res">Poulenc Frères</a>, a successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals (later <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne-Poulenc">Rhône-Poulenc</a>). He was a member of a pious Roman Catholic family from <a href="Espalion">Espalion</a> in the <a href="Departments%20of%20France">département</a> of <a href="Aveyron">Aveyron</a>. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc's view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father's family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother's. The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as "half monk and half naughty boy".
Poulenc grew up in a musical household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide repertoire ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste for what he called "adorable bad music". He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a> and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>: the former's "<a href="Winterreise">Winterreise</a>" and the latter's "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" made a deep impression on him. At his father's insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the <a href="Lyc%C3%A9e%20Condorcet">Lycée Condorcet</a> in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.

In 1916 a childhood friend, Raymonde Linossier (1897–1930), introduced Poulenc to <a href="Adrienne%20Monnier">Adrienne Monnier</a>'s bookshop, the "Maison des Amis des Livres". There he met the "avant-garde" poets <a href="Guillaume%20Apollinaire">Guillaume Apollinaire</a>, <a href="Max%20Jacob">Max Jacob</a>, <a href="Paul%20%C3%89luard">Paul Éluard</a> and <a href="Louis%20Aragon">Louis Aragon</a>. He later set many of their poems to music. In the same year he became the pupil of the pianist <a href="Ricardo%20Vi%C3%B1es">Ricardo Viñes</a>. The biographer <a href="Henri%20Hell">Henri Hell</a> comments that Viñes's influence on his pupil was profound, both as to pianistic technique and the style of Poulenc's keyboard works. Poulenc later said of Viñes:

He was a most delightful man, a bizarre hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough. ... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, he was the only virtuoso who played Debussy and <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything ... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.

When Poulenc was sixteen his mother died; his father died two years later. Viñes became more than a teacher: he was, in the words of Myriam Chimènes in the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", the young man's "spiritual mentor". He encouraged his pupil to compose, and he later gave the premieres of three early Poulenc works. Through him Poulenc became friendly with two composers who helped shape his early development: <a href="Georges%20Auric">Georges Auric</a> and <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>.

Auric, who was the same age as Poulenc, was an early developer musically; by the time the two met, Auric's music had already been performed at important Parisian concert venues. The two young composers shared a similar musical outlook and enthusiasms, and for the rest of Poulenc's life Auric was his most trusted friend and guide. Poulenc called him "my true brother in spirit". Satie, an eccentric figure, isolated from the mainstream French musical establishment, was a mentor to several rising young composers, including Auric, <a href="Louis%20Durey">Louis Durey</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Honegger">Arthur Honegger</a>. After initially dismissing Poulenc as a <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> amateur, he relented and admitted him to the circle of protégés, whom he called ""Les Nouveaux Jeunes"". Poulenc described Satie's influence on him as "immediate and wide, on both the spiritual and musical planes". The pianist <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a> commented that Poulenc's "<a href="Trois%20mouvements%20perp%C3%A9tuels">Trois mouvements perpétuels</a>" were "reflections of the ironical outlook of Satie adapted to the sensitive standards of the current intellectual circles".

Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his "<a href="Rapsodie%20n%C3%A8gre">Rapsodie nègre</a>", a ten-minute, five-<a href="movement%20%28music%29">movement</a> piece for <a href="baritone">baritone</a> and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer <a href="Jane%20Bathori">Jane Bathori</a>. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian <a href="Fl%C3%A2neur">boulevard</a> slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the <a href="rhapsody%20%28music%29">rhapsody</a>. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This "jeu d'esprit" was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call "leg-Poulenc". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot.
In 1917 Poulenc got to know Ravel well enough to have serious discussions with him about music. He was dismayed by Ravel's judgments, which exalted composers whom Poulenc thought little of above those he greatly admired. He told Satie of this unhappy encounter; Satie replied with a dismissive epithet for Ravel who, he said, talked "a load of rubbish". For many years Poulenc was equivocal about Ravel's music, though always respecting him as a man. Ravel's modesty about his own music particularly appealed to Poulenc, who sought throughout his life to follow Ravel's example.

From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French army in the last months of the <a href="French%20Army%20in%20World%20War%20I">First World War</a> and the immediate post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Franco-German front</a>, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Arm%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27Air%20%281909%E2%80%9342%29%23World%20War%20I">Ministry of Aviation</a>. His duties allowed him time for composition; the "<a href="Trois%20mouvements%20perp%C3%A9tuels">Trois mouvements perpétuels</a>" for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at <a href="Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pr%C3%A9">Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré</a>, and he completed his first <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>, "<a href="FP%20%28Poulenc%29%2315a">Le bestiaire</a>", setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the "Trois mouvements perpétuels" rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.

At this stage in his career Poulenc was conscious of his lack of academic musical training; the critic and biographer <a href="Jeremy%20Sams">Jeremy Sams</a> writes that it was the composer's good luck that the public mood was turning against late-<a href="romantic%20music">romantic</a> lushness in favour of the "freshness and insouciant charm" of his works, technically unsophisticated though they were. Four of Poulenc's early works were premiered at the <a href="Salle%20Huyghens">Salle Huyghens</a> in the <a href="Montparnasse">Montparnasse</a> area, where between 1917 and 1920 the cellist Félix Delgrange presented concerts of music by young composers. Among them were Auric, Durey, Honegger, <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a> and <a href="Germaine%20Tailleferre">Germaine Tailleferre</a> who, with Poulenc, became known collectively as ""<a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a>"". After one of their concerts, the critic <a href="Henri%20Collet">Henri Collet</a> published an article titled, "The Five Russians, the Six Frenchmen and Satie". According to Milhaud:
In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Cocteau</a>, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.
Cocteau, though similar in age to "Les Six", was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, "paradoxical and lapidary" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of "Les Six" collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite "<a href="L%27Album%20des%20Six">L'Album des Six</a>" consists of six separate and unrelated pieces. Their 1921 ballet "<a href="Les%20mari%C3%A9s%20de%20la%20tour%20Eiffel">Les mariés de la tour Eiffel</a>" contains three sections by Milhaud, two apiece by Auric, Poulenc and Tailleferre, one by Honegger and none by Durey, who was already distancing himself from the group.

In the early 1920s Poulenc remained concerned at his lack of formal musical training. Satie was suspicious of music colleges, but Ravel advised Poulenc to take composition lessons; Milhaud suggested the composer and teacher <a href="Charles%20Koechlin">Charles Koechlin</a>. Poulenc worked with him intermittently from 1921 to 1925.

From the early 1920s Poulenc was well received abroad, particularly in Britain, both as a performer and a composer. In 1921 <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", "I keep my eye on Francis Poulenc, a young man who has only just arrived at his twenties. He ought to develop into a <a href="farce">farce</a>ur of the first order." Newman said that he had rarely heard anything so deliciously absurd as parts of Poulenc's song cycle "Cocardes", with its accompaniment played by the unorthodox combination of <a href="cornet">cornet</a>, trombone, violin and percussion. In 1922 Poulenc and Milhaud travelled to Vienna to meet <a href="Alban%20Berg">Alban Berg</a>, <a href="Anton%20Webern">Anton Webern</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schönberg</a>. Neither of the French composers was influenced by their Austrian colleagues' revolutionary <a href="Twelve-tone%20technique">twelve-tone</a> system, but they admired the three as its leading proponents. The following year Poulenc received a commission from <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a> for a full-length ballet score. He decided that the theme would be a modern version of the classical French "<a href="f%C3%AAte%20galante">fête galante</a>". This work, "<a href="Les%20biches">Les biches</a>", was an immediate success, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and then in Paris in May, under the direction of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>; it has remained one of Poulenc's best-known scores. Poulenc's new celebrity after the success of the ballet was the unexpected cause of his estrangement from Satie: among the new friends Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, a writer whom Satie regarded with implacable enmity. Auric, who had just enjoyed a similar triumph with a Diaghilev ballet, "Les Fâcheux", was also repudiated by Satie for becoming a friend of Laloy.
As the decade progressed, Poulenc produced a range of compositions, from songs to chamber music and another ballet, "<a href="Aubade%20%28Poulenc%29">Aubade</a>". Hell suggests that Koechlin's influence occasionally inhibited Poulenc's natural simple style, and that Auric offered useful guidance to help him appear in his true colours. At a concert of music by the two friends in 1926, Poulenc's songs were sung for the first time by the <a href="Baritone%23Bariton/Baryton-Martin">baritone</a> <a href="Pierre%20Bernac">Pierre Bernac</a>, from whom, in Hell's phrase, "the name of Poulenc was soon to be inseparable." Another performer with whom the composer came to be closely associated was the <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>ist <a href="Wanda%20Landowska">Wanda Landowska</a>. He heard her as the soloist in <a href="Manuel%20de%20Falla">Falla</a>'s "<a href="El%20retablo%20de%20maese%20Pedro">El retablo de maese Pedro</a>" (1923), an early example of the use of a harpsichord in a modern work, and was immediately taken with the sound. At Landowska's request he wrote a concerto, the "<a href="Concert%20champ%C3%AAtre">Concert champêtre</a>", which she premiered in 1929 with the <a href="Orchestre%20Symphonique%20de%20Paris">Orchestre Symphonique de Paris</a> conducted by <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a>.

The biographer Richard D. E. Burton comments that, in the late 1920s, Poulenc might have seemed to be in an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at <a href="Noizay">Noizay</a>, Indre-et-Loire, south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter <a href="Richard%20Chanlaire">Richard Chanlaire</a>, to whom he sent a copy of the "Concert champêtre" score inscribed, "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, "All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob ... I am now twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.

At the start of the decade, Poulenc returned to writing songs, after a two-year break from doing so. His "Epitaphe", to a poem by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Malherbe">Malherbe</a>, was written in memory of Linossier, and is described by the pianist <a href="Graham%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Graham Johnson</a> as "a profound song in every sense". The following year Poulenc wrote three sets of songs, to words by Apollinaire and Max Jacob, some of which were serious in tone, and others reminiscent of his earlier light-hearted style, as were others of his works of the early 1930s. In 1932 his music was among the first to be broadcast on television, in a transmission by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in which <a href="Reginald%20Kell">Reginald Kell</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Vinter">Gilbert Vinter</a> played his <a href="Sonata%20for%20clarinet%20and%20bassoon">Sonata for clarinet and bassoon</a>. At about this time Poulenc began a relationship with Raymond Destouches, a chauffeur; as with Chanlaire earlier, what began as a passionate affair changed into a deep and lasting friendship. Destouches, who married in the 1950s, remained close to Poulenc until the end of the composer's life.
Two unrelated events in 1936 combined to inspire a reawakening of religious faith and a new depth of seriousness in Poulenc's music. His fellow composer <a href="Pierre-Octave%20Ferroud">Pierre-Octave Ferroud</a> was killed in a car crash so violent that he was decapitated, and almost immediately afterwards, while on holiday, Poulenc visited the sanctuary of <a href="Rocamadour">Rocamadour</a>. He later explained:
A few days earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague ... As I meditated on the fragility of our human frame, I was drawn once more to the life of the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France ... had everything to captivate me ... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my "Litanies à la Vierge noire" for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of "peasant devotion" that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.

Other works that followed continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the <a href="Mass%20%28Poulenc%29">Mass</a> in G major for soprano and mixed choir "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>", which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play "La Reine Margot", starring <a href="Yvonne%20Printemps">Yvonne Printemps</a>, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title "<a href="Suite%20fran%C3%A7aise%20%28Poulenc%29">Suite française</a>". Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.

In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">École Normale</a> in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's "<a href="FP%20%28Poulenc%29%2377">Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard</a>". They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the "three great meetings" of his professional career, the other two being Éluard and Landowska. In Johnson's words, "for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc's counsellor and conscience", and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.

Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as "the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits". In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. "<a href="Quatre%20motets%20pour%20un%20temps%20de%20p%C3%A9nitence">Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence</a>" (Four Penitential Motets, 1938–39) and the song "Bleuet" (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle "<a href="Fian%C3%A7ailles%20pour%20rire">Fiançailles pour rire</a>" (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures the spirit of "Les biches", in the opinion of Hell.

Poulenc was briefly a soldier again during the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II%23French%20Army%20%281939%E2%80%9340%29">Second World War</a>; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an anti-aircraft unit at <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>. After France <a href="Battle%20of%20France">surrendered to Germany</a>, Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year with family and friends at <a href="Brive-la-Gaillarde">Brive-la-Gaillarde</a> in south-central France. In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating "Les biches" and reworking his 1932 <a href="Sextet%20%28Poulenc%29">Sextet</a> for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once back at his home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were "<a href="L%27Histoire%20de%20Babar%2C%20le%20petit%20%C3%A9l%C3%A9phant">L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant</a>" for piano and narrator, the <a href="Cello%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">Cello Sonata</a>, the ballet "<a href="Les%20Animaux%20mod%C3%A8les">Les Animaux modèles</a>" and the song cycle "<a href="Banalit%C3%A9s%20%28Poulenc%29">Banalités</a>".
For most of the war, Poulenc was in Paris, giving recitals with Bernac, concentrating on French songs. Under <a href="German%20military%20administration%20in%20occupied%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">Nazi rule</a> he was in a vulnerable position, as a known homosexual (Destouches narrowly avoided arrest and deportation), but in his music he made many gestures of defiance of the Germans. He set to music verses by poets prominent in the <a href="French%20Resistance">French Resistance</a>, including Aragon and Éluard. In "Les Animaux modèles", premiered at the <a href="Paris%20Opera">Opéra</a> in 1942, he included the tune, repeated several times, of the anti-German song "Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine". He was a founder-member of the <a href="National%20Front%20%28French%20Resistance%29">Front National</a> (pour musique) which the Nazi authorities viewed with suspicion for its association with banned musicians such as Milhaud and <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>. In 1943 he wrote a <a href="cantata">cantata</a> for unaccompanied double choir intended for Belgium, "<a href="Figure%20humaine">Figure humaine</a>", setting eight of Éluard's poems. The work, ending with "Liberté", could not be given in France while the Germans were in control; its first performance was broadcast from a BBC studio in London in March 1945, and it was not sung in Paris until 1947. The music critic of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" later wrote that the work "is among the very finest choral works of our time and in itself removes Poulenc from the category of "petit maître" to which ignorance has generally been content to relegate him."

In January 1945, commissioned by the French government, Poulenc and Bernac flew from Paris to London, where they received an enthusiastic welcome. The <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> gave a reception in the composer's honour; he and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> were the soloists in a performance of Poulenc's <a href="Concerto%20for%20Two%20Pianos%20and%20Orchestra%20%28Poulenc%29">Double Piano Concerto</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>; with Bernac he gave recitals of French "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>s" and piano works at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> and the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, and recorded for the BBC. Bernac was overwhelmed by the public's response; when he and Poulenc stepped out on the Wigmore Hall stage, "the audience rose and my emotion was such that instead of beginning to sing, I began to weep." After their fortnight's stay, the two returned home on the first boat-train to leave London for Paris since May 1940.

In Paris, Poulenc completed his scores for "L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant" and his first opera, "<a href="Les%20mamelles%20de%20Tir%C3%A9sias">Les mamelles de Tirésias</a>" (The Breasts of <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a>), a short <a href="op%C3%A9ra%20bouffe">opéra bouffe</a> of about an hour's duration. The work is a setting of Apollinaire's play of the same name, staged in 1917. Sams describes the opera as "high-spirited topsy-turveydom" concealing "a deeper and sadder theme – the need to repopulate and rediscover a France ravaged by war". It was premiered in June 1947 at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, and was a critical success, but did not prove popular with the public. The leading female role was taken by <a href="Denise%20Duval">Denise Duval</a>, who became the composer's favourite <a href="soprano">soprano</a>, frequent recital partner and dedicatee of some of his music. He called her the nightingale who made him cry (""Mon rossignol à larmes"").
Shortly after the war, Poulenc had a brief affair with a woman, Fréderique ("Freddy") Lebedeff, with whom he had a daughter, Marie-Ange, in 1946. The child was brought up without knowing who her father was (Poulenc was supposedly her "godfather") but he made generous provision for her, and she was the principal beneficiary of his will.

In the post-war period Poulenc crossed swords with composers of the younger generation who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a> were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg's music was now "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" earned him the enmity of composers such as <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.

In 1948 Poulenc made his first visit to the US, in a two-month concert tour with Bernac. He returned there frequently until 1961, giving recitals with Bernac or Duval and as soloist in the world premiere of his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Poulenc%29">Piano Concerto</a> (1949), commissioned by the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>.

Poulenc began the 1950s with a new partner in his private life, Lucien Roubert, a travelling salesman. Professionally Poulenc was productive, writing a seven-song cycle setting poems by Éluard, "<a href="FP%20%28Poulenc%29%23147">La Fraîcheur et le feu</a>" (1950), and the "<a href="Stabat%20Mater%20%28Poulenc%29">Stabat Mater</a>", in memory of the painter <a href="Christian%20B%C3%A9rard">Christian Bérard</a>, composed in 1950 and premiered the following year.
In 1953, Poulenc was offered a commission by <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a> and the <a href="Milan">Milan</a>ese publisher <a href="Casa%20Ricordi">Casa Ricordi</a> for a ballet. He considered the story of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Cortona">St Margaret of Cortona</a> but found a dance version of her life impracticable. He preferred to write an opera on a religious theme; Ricordi suggested "Dialogues des Carmélites", an unfilmed screenplay by <a href="Georges%20Bernanos">Georges Bernanos</a>. The text, based on a short story by <a href="Gertrud%20von%20Le%20Fort">Gertrud von Le Fort</a>, depicts the <a href="Martyrs%20of%20Compi%C3%A8gne">Martyrs of Compiègne</a>, nuns guillotined during the French Revolution for their religious beliefs. Poulenc found it "such a moving and noble work", ideal for his libretto, and he began composition in August 1953.

During the composition of the opera, Poulenc suffered two blows. He learned of a dispute between Bernanos's estate and the writer <a href="Emmet%20Lavery">Emmet Lavery</a>, who held the rights to theatrical adaptations of Le Fort's novel; this caused Poulenc to stop work on his opera. At about the same time Roubert became gravely ill. Intense worry pushed Poulenc into a nervous breakdown, and in November 1954 he was in a clinic at <a href="L%27Ha%C3%BF-les-Roses">L'Haÿ-les-Roses</a>, outside Paris, heavily sedated. When he recovered, and the literary rights and royalty payments disputes with Lavery were settled, he resumed work on "<a href="Dialogues%20of%20the%20Carmelites">Dialogues des Carmélites</a>" in between extensive touring with Bernac in England. As his personal wealth had declined since the 1920s he required the substantial income earned from his recitals.

While working on the opera, Poulenc composed little else; exceptions were two "mélodies", and a short orchestral movement, "Bucolique" in a collective work, "<a href="Variations%20sur%20le%20nom%20de%20Marguerite%20Long">Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long</a>" (1954), to which his old friends from "Les Six" Auric and Milhaud also contributed. As Poulenc was writing the last pages of his opera in October 1955, Roubert died at the age of forty-seven. The composer wrote to a friend, "Lucien was delivered from his martyrdom ten days ago and the final copy of "Les Carmélites" was completed (take note) at the very moment my dear breathed his last."

The opera was first given in January 1957 at La Scala in Italian translation. Between then and the French premiere Poulenc introduced one of his most popular late works, the <a href="Flute%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">Flute Sonata</a>, which he and <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Rampal">Jean-Pierre Rampal</a> performed in June at the Strasbourg Festival. Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of "Dialogues des Carmélites" at the Opéra. It was a tremendous success, to the composer's considerable relief. At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc's life.
In 1958 Poulenc embarked on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in <a href="La%20voix%20humaine">an operatic version</a> of the latter's 1930 <a href="monodrama">monodrama</a> "<a href="The%20Human%20Voice">La Voix humaine</a>". The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.

Poulenc visited the US in 1960 and 1961. Among his works given during these trips were the American premiere of "La Voix humaine" at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in New York, with Duval, and the world premiere of his <a href="Gloria%20%28Poulenc%29">Gloria</a>, a large-scale work for soprano, four-part mixed chorus and orchestra, conducted in Boston by <a href="Charles%20Munch%20%28conductor%29">Charles Munch</a>. In 1961 Poulenc published a book about Chabrier, a 187-page study of which a reviewer wrote in the 1980s, "he writes with love and insight of a composer whose views he shared on matters like the primacy of melody and the essential seriousness of humour." The works of Poulenc's last twelve months included "<a href="Sept%20r%C3%A9pons%20des%20t%C3%A9n%C3%A8bres">Sept répons des ténèbres</a>" for voices and orchestra, the <a href="Clarinet%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">Clarinet Sonata</a> and the <a href="Sonata%20for%20oboe%20and%20piano%20%28Poulenc%29">Oboe Sonata</a>.

On 30 January 1963, at his flat opposite the <a href="Jardin%20du%20Luxembourg">Jardin du Luxembourg</a>, Poulenc suffered a fatal heart attack. His funeral was at the nearby church of <a href="Church%20of%20Saint-Sulpice%2C%20Paris">Saint-Sulpice</a>. In compliance with his wishes, none of his music was performed; <a href="Marcel%20Dupr%C3%A9">Marcel Dupré</a> played works by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> on the grand organ of the church. Poulenc was buried at <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>, alongside his family.
Poulenc's music is essentially <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a>. In <a href="Henri%20Hell">Henri Hell</a>'s view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of <a href="Roger%20Nichols%20%28musical%20scholar%29">Roger Nichols</a> in the "Grove" dictionary, "For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted." The commentator George Keck writes, "His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive."

Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer <a href="Lennox%20Berkeley">Lennox Berkeley</a> wrote of him, "All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity." Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language "as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a> that is rarely more than passing". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for "a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!" He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to <a href="dodecaphony">dodecaphony</a>, led by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Leibowitz">René Leibowitz</a>, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a>, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is "directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up – ""la légende de facilité"" – that his music came easily to him; he commented, "The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts."

The pianist <a href="Pascal%20Rog%C3%A9">Pascal Rogé</a> commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: "You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is." Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was "healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav".

Poulenc's principal works for large orchestra comprise two ballets, a "<a href="Sinfonietta%20%28Poulenc%29">Sinfonietta</a>" and four keyboard concertos. The first of the ballets, "<a href="Les%20biches">Les biches</a>", was first performed in 1924 and remains one of his best-known works. Nichols writes in "Grove" that the clear and tuneful score has no deep, or even shallow, symbolism, a fact "accentuated by a tiny passage of mock-<a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagnerian</a> brass, complete with emotive <a href="Ninth%23Minor%20ninth">minor 9ths</a>". The first two of the four concertos are in Poulenc's light-hearted vein. The "<a href="Concert%20champ%C3%AAtre">Concert champêtre</a>" for harpsichord and orchestra (1927–28), evokes the countryside seen from a Parisian point of view: Nichols comments that the <a href="fanfare">fanfare</a>s in the last movement bring to mind the bugles in the barracks of <a href="Vincennes">Vincennes</a> in the Paris suburbs. The <a href="Concerto%20for%20Two%20Pianos%20and%20Orchestra%20%28Poulenc%29">Concerto for two pianos and orchestra</a> (1932) is similarly a work intended purely to entertain. It draws on a variety of stylistic sources: the first movement ends in a manner reminiscent of <a href="Bali">Bali</a>nese <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a>, and the slow movement begins in a Mozartian style, which Poulenc gradually fills out with his own characteristic personal touches. The <a href="Organ%20Concerto%20%28Poulenc%29">Organ Concerto</a> (1938) is in a much more serious vein. Poulenc said that it was "on the outskirts" of his religious music, and there are passages that draw on the church music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, though there are also interludes in breezy popular style. The second ballet score, "<a href="Les%20Animaux%20mod%C3%A8les">Les Animaux modèles</a>" (1941), has never equalled the popularity of "Les biches", though both Auric and Honegger praised the composer's harmonic flair and resourceful orchestration. Honegger wrote, "The influences that have worked on him, Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky, are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think – it's Poulenc." The "Sinfonietta" (1947) is a reversion to Poulenc's pre-war frivolity. He came to feel, "I dressed too young for my age ... [it] is a new version of "Les biches" but young girls ["biches"] that are forty-eight years old – that's horrible!" The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Poulenc%29">Concerto for piano and orchestra</a> (1949) initially caused some disappointment: many felt that it was not an advance on Poulenc's pre-war music, a view he came to share. The piece has been re-evaluated in more recent years, and in 1996 the writer Claire Delamarche rated it as the composer's finest concertante work.

Poulenc, a highly accomplished pianist, usually composed at the piano and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing can be divided into the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, in the view of the writer Keith W Daniel, "what might be called 'miniatures'". Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: "I tolerate the "Mouvements perpétuels", my old "<a href="Piano%20Suite%20%28Poulenc%29">Suite en ut</a>" [in C], and the "Trois pieces". I like very much my two collections of Improvisations, an <a href="Intermezzo">Intermezzo</a> in A flat, and certain <a href="Nocturne">Nocturne</a>s. I condemn "Napoli" and the "<a href="Soir%C3%A9es%20de%20Nazelles">Soirées de Nazelles</a>" without reprieve."

Of the pieces cited with approval by Poulenc, the fifteen Improvisations were composed at intervals between 1932 and 1959. All are brief: the longest lasts a little more than three minutes. They vary from swift and balletic to tender lyricism, old-fashioned <a href="march%20%28music%29">march</a>, "<a href="perpetuum%20mobile">perpetuum mobile</a>", <a href="waltz%20%28music%29">waltz</a> and a poignant musical portrait of the singer <a href="%C3%89dith%20Piaf">Édith Piaf</a>. Poulenc's favoured Intermezzo was the last of three. Numbers one and two were composed in August 1934; the A flat followed in March 1943. The commentators Marina and Victor Ledin describe the work as "the embodiment of the word 'charming'. The music seems simply to roll off the pages, each sound following another in such an honest and natural way, with eloquence and unmistakable Frenchness." The eight nocturnes were composed across nearly a decade (1929–38). Whether or not Poulenc originally conceived them as an integral set, he gave the eighth the title "To serve as Coda for the Cycle" ("Pour servir de Coda au Cycle"). Although they share their generic title with the nocturnes of <a href="John%20Field%20%28composer%29">Field</a>, Chopin and Fauré, Poulenc's do not resemble those of the earlier composers, being "night-scenes and sound-images of public and private events" rather than romantic <a href="Symphonic%20poem">tone poems</a>.

The pieces Poulenc found merely tolerable were all early works: "Trois mouvements perpétuels" dates from 1919, the Suite in C from 1920 and the Trois pièces from 1928. All consist of short sections, the longest being the "Hymne", the second of the three 1928 pieces, which lasts about four minutes. Of the two works their composer singled out for censure, "Napoli" (1925) is a three-movement portrait of Italy, and "Les Soirées de Nazelles" is described by the composer <a href="Geoffrey%20Bush">Geoffrey Bush</a> as "the French equivalent of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>'s "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>"" – miniature character sketches of his friends. Despite Poulenc's scorn for the work, Bush judges it ingenious and witty. Among the piano music not mentioned, favourably or harshly, by Poulenc, the best known pieces include the two <a href="Trois%20novelettes%20%28Poulenc%29">Novelettes</a> (1927–28), the set of six miniatures for children, "Villageoises" (1933), a piano version of the seven-movement "Suite française" (1935), and "L'embarquement pour Cythère" for two pianos (1953).

In "Grove", Nichols divides the chamber works into three clearly differentiated periods. The first four sonatas come from the early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo "divertissements" alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity – less than ten minutes each – their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the "<a href="Rapsodie%20n%C3%A8gre">Rapsodie nègre</a>", <a href="FP%20%28Poulenc%29">FP</a> 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the <a href="Trio%20for%20oboe%2C%20bassoon%20and%20piano">Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano</a> (1926).

The <a href="chamber%20music">chamber works</a> of Poulenc's middle period were written in the 1930s and 1940s. The best known is the Sextet for Piano and Wind (1932), in Poulenc's light-hearted vein, consisting of two lively outer movements and a central "divertimento"; this was one of several chamber works that the composer became dissatisfied with and revised extensively some years after their first performance (in this case in 1939–40). The sonatas in this group are for <a href="Violin%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">violin and piano</a> (1942–43) and for <a href="Cello%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">cello and piano</a> (1948). Writing for strings did not come easily to Poulenc; these sonatas were completed after two unsuccessful earlier attempts, and in 1947 he destroyed the draft of a string quartet. Both sonatas are predominantly grave in character; that for violin is dedicated to the memory of <a href="Federico%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Lorca">Federico García Lorca</a>. Commentators including Hell, Schmidt and Poulenc himself have regarded it, and to some extent the cello sonata, as less effective than those for wind. The "Aubade", "Concerto choréographique" for piano and 18 instruments (1930) achieves an almost orchestral effect, despite its modest number of players. The other chamber works from this period are arrangements for small ensembles of two works in Poulenc's lightest vein, the "Suite française" (1935) and the "Trois mouvements perpétuels" (1946).

The final three sonatas are for woodwind and piano: for <a href="Flute%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">flute</a> (1956–57), <a href="Clarinet%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">clarinet</a> (1962), and <a href="Oboe%20Sonata%20%28Poulenc%29">oboe</a> (1962). They have, according to "Grove", become fixtures in their repertoires because of "their technical expertise and of their profound beauty". The "Elégie" for horn and piano (1957) was composed in memory of the horn player <a href="Dennis%20Brain">Dennis Brain</a>. It contains one of Poulenc's rare excursions into dodecaphony, with the brief employment of a twelve-note <a href="tone%20row">tone row</a>.

Poulenc composed songs throughout his career, and his output in the genre is extensive. In Johnson's view, most of the finest were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Though widely varied in character, the songs are dominated by Poulenc's preference for certain poets. From the outset of his career he favoured verses by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the writer whose work he set most often was Paul Éluard. Other poets whose works he frequently set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and <a href="Louise%20de%20Vilmorin">Louise de Vilmorin</a>. In the view of the music critic Andrew Clements, the Éluard songs include many of Poulenc's greatest settings; Johnson calls the cycle "Tel Jour, Telle Nuit" (1937) the composer's "watershed work", and Nichols regards it as "a masterpiece worthy to stand beside Fauré's "<a href="La%20bonne%20chanson%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">La bonne chanson</a>"". Clements finds in the Éluard settings a profundity "worlds away from the brittle, facetious surfaces of Poulenc's early orchestral and instrumental music". The first of the "Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon" (1943), titled simply "C", is described by Johnson as "a masterpiece known the world over; it is the most unusual, and perhaps the most moving, song about the ravages of war ever composed."

In an overview of the songs in 1973, the musical scholar <a href="Yvonne%20Gouvern%C3%A9">Yvonne Gouverné</a> said, "With Poulenc, the melodic line matches the text so well that it seems in some way to complete it, thanks to the gift which the music has for penetrating the very essence of a given poem; nobody has better crafted a phrase than Poulenc, highlighting the colour of the words." Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer's most popular songs is a setting of "<a href="Les%20Chemins%20de%20l%27amour">Les Chemins de l'amour</a>" for <a href="Jean%20Anouilh">Jean Anouilh</a>'s 1940 play as a Parisian waltz; by contrast his "monologue" "La Dame de Monte Carlo", (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer's painful understanding of the horrors of depression.

Apart from a single early work for unaccompanied choir ("Chanson à boire", 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he produced three works for choir: "Sept chansons" (settings of verses by Éluard and others), "Petites voix" (for children's voices), and his religious work "<a href="Litanies%20%C3%A0%20la%20Vierge%20Noire">Litanies à la Vierge Noire</a>", for female or children's voices and organ. The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as having something of a <a href="baroque%20music">baroque</a> style, with "vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large". Poulenc's new-found religious theme continued with "Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence" (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata "Figure humaine" (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality. Other "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" works include the "Quatre motets pour le temps de Noël" (1952), which make severe demands on choirs' rhythmic precision and intonation.

Poulenc's major works for choir and orchestra are the "Stabat Mater" (1950), the "<a href="Gloria%20%28Poulenc%29">Gloria</a>" (1959–60), and "<a href="Sept%20r%C3%A9pons%20des%20t%C3%A9n%C3%A8bres">Sept répons des ténèbres</a>" (Seven responsories for "<a href="Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a>", 1961–62). All these works are based on liturgical texts, originally set to <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>. In the "Gloria", Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me a few days in <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." "Sept répons des ténèbres", which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own <a href="requiem">requiem</a> and is "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his "magnum opus sacrum", the opera, "Dialogues des Carmélites"."

Poulenc turned to opera only in the latter half of his career. Having achieved fame by his early twenties, he was in his forties before attempting his first opera. He attributed this to the need for maturity before tackling the subjects he chose to set. In 1958 he told an interviewer, "When I was 24 I was able to write "Les biches" [but] it is obvious that unless a composer of 30 has the genius of a Mozart or the precociousness of Schubert he couldn't write "The Carmelites" – the problems are too profound." In Sams's view, all three of Poulenc's operas display a depth of feeling far distant from "the cynical stylist of the 1920s": "<a href="Les%20mamelles%20de%20Tir%C3%A9sias">Les mamelles de Tirésias</a>" (1947), despite the riotous plot, is full of nostalgia and a sense of loss. In the two avowedly serious operas, "<a href="Dialogues%20of%20the%20Carmelites">Dialogues des Carmélites</a>" (1957) and "<a href="La%20voix%20humaine">La Voix humaine</a>" (1959), in which Poulenc depicts deep human suffering, Sams sees a reflection of the composer's own struggles with depression.

In terms of musical technique the operas show how far Poulenc had come from his naïve and insecure beginnings. Nichols comments in "Grove" that "Les mamelles de Tirésias", deploys "lyrical solos, patter duets, chorales, <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> lines for tenor and bass babies and ... succeeds in being both funny and beautiful". In all three operas Poulenc drew on earlier composers, while blending their influence into music unmistakably his own. In the printed score of "Dialogues des Carmélites" he acknowledged his debt to <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</a>, <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>, Debussy and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>. The critic <a href="Renaud%20Machart">Renaud Machart</a> writes that "Dialogues des Carmélites" is, with Britten's "<a href="Peter%20Grimes">Peter Grimes</a>", one of the extremely rare operas written since the Second World War to appear on opera programmes all over the world.

Even when he wrote for a large orchestra, Poulenc used the full forces sparingly in his operas, often scoring for woodwinds or brass or strings alone. With the invaluable input of Bernac he showed great skill in writing for the human voice, fitting the music to the <a href="tessitura">tessitura</a> of each character. By the time of the last of the operas, "La Voix humaine", Poulenc felt able to give the soprano stretches of music with no orchestral accompaniment at all, though when the orchestra plays, Poulenc calls for the music to be "bathed in sensuality".

Poulenc was among the composers who recognised in the 1920s the important role that the <a href="phonograph">gramophone</a> would play in the promotion of music. The first recording of his music was made in 1928, with the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="Claire%20Croiza">Claire Croiza</a> accompanied by the composer at the piano, in the complete song cycle "La bestiaire" for French <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a>. He made numerous recordings, mainly for the French division of <a href="EMI%20Classics">EMI</a>. With Bernac and Duval he recorded many of his own songs, and those of other composers including Chabrier, Debussy, <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a> and Ravel. He played the piano part in recordings of his "Babar the Elephant" with <a href="Pierre%20Fresnay">Pierre Fresnay</a> and <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> as narrators. In 2005, EMI issued a DVD, "Francis Poulenc & Friends", featuring filmed performances of Poulenc's music, played by the composer, with Duval, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Rampal">Jean-Pierre Rampal</a>, <a href="Jacques%20F%C3%A9vrier">Jacques Février</a> and <a href="Georges%20Pr%C3%AAtre">Georges Prêtre</a>.
A 1984 discography of Poulenc's music lists recordings by more than 1,300 conductors, soloists and ensembles, including the conductors <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, <a href="Charles%20Dutoit">Charles Dutoit</a>, Milhaud, <a href="Charles%20Munch%20%28conductor%29">Charles Munch</a>, <a href="Eugene%20Ormandy">Eugene Ormandy</a>, Prêtre, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a> and <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a>. Among the singers, in addition to Bernac and Duval, the list includes <a href="R%C3%A9gine%20Crespin">Régine Crespin</a>, <a href="Dietrich%20Fischer-Dieskau">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a>, <a href="Nicolai%20Gedda">Nicolai Gedda</a>, <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a>, <a href="Yvonne%20Printemps">Yvonne Printemps</a> and <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Souzay">Gérard Souzay</a>. Instrumental soloists include Britten, <a href="Jacques%20F%C3%A9vrier">Jacques Février</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Fournier">Pierre Fournier</a>, <a href="Emil%20Gilels">Emil Gilels</a>, <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a>.

Complete sets of Poulenc's solo piano music have been recorded by <a href="Gabriel%20Tacchino">Gabriel Tacchino</a>, who had been Poulenc's only piano student (released on the EMI label), Pascal Rogé (<a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>), <a href="Paul%20Crossley%20%28musician%29">Paul Crossley</a> (<a href="Sony%20Classics">CBS</a>), Eric Parkin (<a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos</a>) and <a href="Olivier%20Cazal">Olivier Cazal</a> (<a href="Naxos%20Records">Naxos</a>). Integral sets of the chamber music have been recorded by the Nash Ensemble (<a href="Hyperion%20Records">Hyperion</a>), and a variety of young French musicians (Naxos).

The world premiere of "Dialogues des Carmélites" (in Italian, as "Dialoghi delle Carmelitane") was recorded and has been released on CD. The first studio recording was soon after the French premiere, and since then there have been at least ten live or studio recordings on CD or DVD, most of them in French but one in German and one in English.

The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer <a href="Ned%20Rorem">Ned Rorem</a> observed, "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's "<a href="Le%20marteau%20sans%20ma%C3%AEtre">Le marteau sans maître</a>" with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">Sacre</a> [du Printemps]". It was not progress." Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".

In his last years Poulenc observed, "if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my "Stabat Mater" rather than the "Mouvements perpétuels"." In a centenary tribute in "The Times" Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias." At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation."

Cucurbita

Cucurbita (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for <a href="gourd">gourd</a>) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> <a href="vine">vine</a>s in the gourd <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Cucurbitaceae">Cucurbitaceae</a>, also known as cucurbits, native to the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> and <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, <a href="pumpkin">pumpkin</a>, or gourd depending on species, <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a>, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus "<a href="Lagenaria">Lagenaria</a>", which is in the same family and subfamily as "Cucurbita" but in a different <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a>. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.

Most "Cucurbita" species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have <a href="tendril">tendril</a>s, but non-vining "bush" cultivars of "C. pepo" and "C. maxima" have also been developed. The yellow or orange flowers on a "Cucurbita" plant are of two types: female and male. The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce <a href="pollen">pollen</a>. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist <a href="Apidae">bee</a> <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s, but other insects with more general feeding habits, such as <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a>s, also visit.

There is debate about the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the genus, as the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five <a href="Domestication%23Plants">domesticated</a> species are "<a href="Cucurbita%20argyrosperma">Cucurbita argyrosperma</a>", "<a href="Cucurbita%20ficifolia">C. ficifolia</a>", "<a href="Cucurbita%20maxima">C. maxima</a>", "<a href="Cucurbita%20moschata">C. moschata</a>", and "<a href="Cucurbita%20pepo">C. pepo</a>". All of these can be treated as <a href="winter%20squash">winter squash</a> because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, "C. pepo" includes some <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s that are better used only as <a href="summer%20squash">summer squash</a>.

The fruits of the genus "Cucurbita" are good sources of <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, such as <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a> and <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including <a href="pumpkin%20pie">pumpkin pie</a>, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups.

"Cucurbita" species fall into two main groups. The first group are <a href="annual%20plant">annual</a> or short-lived <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial</a> vines and are <a href="mesophyte">mesophytic</a>, i.e. they require a more or less continuous water supply. The second group are <a href="perennial%20plant">perennials</a> growing in arid zones and so are <a href="xerophyte">xerophytic</a>, tolerating dry conditions. Cultivated "Cucurbita" species were derived from the first group. Growing in height or length, the plant stem produces <a href="tendril">tendril</a>s to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is "C. ficifolia", and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial "Cucurbita" can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among "Cucurbita" fruits, and even within a single species. "C. ficifolia" is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> variation in the species "C. pepo" and "C. maxima" is so vast that its various <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.
The typical cultivated "Cucurbita" species has five-lobed or <a href="Leaf%20shape">palmately divided</a> leaves with long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with various types of <a href="trichome">trichome</a>s, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each <a href="Plant%20stem">node</a> and are branching in some species. "C. argyrosperma" has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of "C. pepo" leaves varies widely. "C. moschata" plants can have light or dense <a href="Leaf%23Surface">pubescence</a>. "C. ficifolia" leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species may or may not have white spots.

There are male (<a href="stamen">staminate</a>) and female (<a href="pistil">pistil</a>late) flowers (unisexual flowers) on a single plant (<a href="monoecious">monoecious</a>), and these grow singly, appearing from the <a href="Axillary%20bud">leaf axils</a>. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the <a href="petal%23Corolla">corolla</a>) and a green bell-shaped <a href="Sepal">calyx</a>. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in "Cucurbita" there are only three, and their <a href="anther">anther</a>s are joined together so that there appears to be one. Female flowers have thick <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicels</a>, and an <a href="inferior%20ovary">inferior ovary</a> with 3–5 <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigmas</a> that each have two lobes. The female flowers of "C. argyrosperma" and "C. ficifolia" have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of "C. pepo" have a small calyx, but the calyx of "C. moschata" male flowers is comparatively short.
"Cucurbita" fruits are large and fleshy. Botanists classify the "Cucurbita" fruit as a <a href="Berry%20%28botany%29%23Modified%20berries">pepo</a>, which is a special type of <a href="Berry%20%28botany%29">berry</a> derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with <a href="hypanthium">hypanthium</a> tissue forming an <a href="exocarp">exocarp</a> around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of <a href="mesocarp">mesocarp</a> and <a href="endocarp">endocarp</a>. The term "pepo" is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of "<a href="Passiflora">Passiflora</a>" and "<a href="Carica">Carica</a>" are sometimes also pepos. The seeds, which are attached to the ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, are large and fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over . The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> with a pumpkin.

"Cucurbita" was formally described in a way that meets the requirements of modern <a href="botanical%20nomenclature">botanical nomenclature</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Genera%20Plantarum">Genera Plantarum</a>", the fifth edition of 1754 in conjunction with the 1753 first edition of "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>". "Cucurbita pepo" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus. Linnaeus initially included the species "C. pepo", "C. verrucosa" and "C. melopepo" (both now included in "C. pepo"), as well as "C. citrullus" (watermelon, now "<a href="Citrullus%20lanatus">Citrullus lanatus</a>") and "C. lagenaria" (now "<a href="Lagenaria%20siceraria">Lagenaria siceraria</a>") (both are not "Cucurbita" but are in the family Cucurbitaceae.

The "Cucurbita digitata", "C. foetidissima", "C. galeotti", and "C. pedatifolia" <a href="species%20group">species group</a>s are xerophytes, arid zone perennials with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated from each other by <a href="Reproductive%20isolation">sterility barriers</a> and have different physiological characteristics. Some <a href="Allogamy">cross pollinations</a> can occur: "C. pepo" with "C. argyrosperma" and "C. moschata"; and "C. maxima" with "C. moschata". Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd ("C. foetidissima"), which; according to some, does not taste good, has been used as an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common "Cucurbita".

Various <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> treatments have been proposed for "Cucurbita", ranging from 13–30 species. In 1990, "Cucurbita" expert Michael Nee classified them into the following oft-cited 13 species groups (27 species total), listed by group and alphabetically, with geographic origin:

The taxonomy by Nee closely matches the species groupings reported in a pair of studies by a botanical team led by Rhodes and Bemis in 1968 and 1970 based on statistical groupings of several <a href="phenotype">phenotypic</a> traits of 21 species. Seeds for studying additional species members were not available. Sixteen of the 21 species were grouped into five clusters with the remaining five being classified separately:

The full <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> of this genus is unknown, and research was ongoing in 2014. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> of "Cucurbita" phylogeny is based upon a 2002 study of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> by Sanjur and colleagues.

All species of "Cucurbita" have 20 pairs of <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s in the <a href="Apidae">apid</a> tribe <a href="Eucerini">Eucerini</a>, especially the genera "<a href="Peponapis">Peponapis</a>" and "<a href="Xenoglossa">Xenoglossa</a>", and these <a href="squash%20bee">squash bee</a>s can be crucial to the flowers producing fruit after pollination.
When there is more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are produced in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called <a href="xenia%20%28plants%29">xenia</a>. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. <a href="Parthenocarpy">Seedlessness</a> is known to occur in certain cultivars of "C. pepo".

The most critical factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological, having to do with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit. The <a href="plant%20hormone">plant hormone</a>s <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> and <a href="auxin">auxin</a> are key in fruit set and development. Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers. When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature, a phenomenon called "first-fruit dominance", and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem. <a href="Ethephon">Ethephon</a>, a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production.

The plant hormone <a href="gibberellin">gibberellin</a>, produced in the stamens, is essential for the development of all parts of the male flowers. The development of female flowers is not yet understood. Gibberellin is also involved in other developmental processes of plants such as seed and stem growth.

Seeds with maximum <a href="germination">germination</a> potential develop (in "C. moschata") by 45 days after <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>, and seed weight reaches its maximum 70 days after anthesis. Some varieties of "C. pepo" germinate best with eight hours of sunlight daily and a planting depth of . Seeds planted deeper than are not likely to germinate. In "C. foetidissima", a weedy species, plants younger than 19 days old are not able to sprout from the roots after removing the shoots. In a seed batch with 90 percent germination rate, over 90 percent of the plants had sprouted after 29 days from planting.

Experiments have shown that when more pollen is applied to the stigma, as well as the fruit containing more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of "Cucurbita". A type of stored phosphorus called <a href="Phytic%20acid">phytate</a> forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called <a href="Globoid%20%28botany%29">globoids</a>. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">Heavy metal</a> contamination, including <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. "Cucurbita" plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.

Archaeological investigations have found evidence of domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, "C. argyrosperma", "C. ficifolia", "C. moschata", and "C. pepo", originated and were domesticated in <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>; for the fifth, "C. maxima", these events occurred in South America.

Within "C. pepo", the pumpkins, the scallops, and possibly the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of "C. pepo" have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of "C. pepo", botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.
"C. argyrosperma" is not as widespread as the other species. The wild form "C. a." subsp. "sororia" is found from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> to <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, and cultivated forms are used in a somewhat wider area stretching from Panama to the southeastern United States. It was probably bred for its seeds, which are large and high in <a href="Oil%23Organic%20oils">oil</a> and <a href="Protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>, but its flesh is of poorer quality than that of "C. moschata" and "C. pepo". It is grown in a wide altitudinal range: from sea level to as high as in dry areas, usually with the use of irrigation, or in areas with a defined rainy season, where seeds are sown in May and June.

"C. ficifolia" and "C. moschata" were originally thought to be Asiatic in origin, but this has been disproven. The origin of "C. ficifolia" is Latin America, most likely southern Mexico, Central America, or the Andes. It grows at altitudes ranging from to in areas with heavy rainfall. It does not hybridize well with the other cultivated species as it has significantly different enzymes and chromosomes.

"C. maxima" originated in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants are sensitive to <a href="Frost%23Effect%20on%20plants">frost</a>, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. "C. maxima" did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of "C. maxima" include "triloba", "zapallito", "zipinka", Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow ("C. maxima" Marrow), Show, and Turban.
"C. moschata" is native to Latin America, but the precise location of origin is uncertain. It has been present in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Peru for 4,000–6,000 years and has spread to Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. This species is closely related to "C. argyrosperma". A variety known as the Seminole Pumpkin has been cultivated in Florida since before the arrival of Columbus. Its leaves are wide. It generally grows at low altitudes in hot climates with heavy rainfall, but some varieties have been found above . Groups of "C. moschata" include Cheese, Crookneck ("C. moschata"), and Bell.

"C. pepo" is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, domesticated species with the oldest known locations being <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, Mexico, 8,000–10,000 years ago, and <a href="Ocampo%2C%20Tamaulipas">Ocampo, Tamaulipas</a>, Mexico, about 7,000 years ago. It is known to have appeared in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, United States, at least 4,000 years ago. Debates about the origin of "C. pepo" have been on-going since at least 1857. There have traditionally been two opposing theories about its origin: 1) that it is a direct descendant of "C. texana" and 2) that "C. texana" is merely <a href="Feral%20organism">feral</a> "C. pepo". A more recent theory by botanist Thomas Andres in 1987 is that descendants of "C. fraterna" hybridized with "C. texana", resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with "C. fraterna" and "C. texana", respectively, as the ancestral species. "C. pepo" may have appeared in the Old World before moving from Mexico into South America. It is found from sea level to slightly above . Leaves have 3–5 lobes and are wide. All the subspecies, varieties, and <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s are <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">interfertile</a>. In 1986 Paris proposed a revised taxonomy of the edible cultivated "C. pepo" based primarily on the shape of the fruit, with eight groups . All but a few "C. pepo" cultivars can be included in these groups. There is one non-edible cultivated variety: "C. pepo" var. "ovifera".

The ancestral species of the genus "Cucurbita" were present in the Americas before the <a href="Prehistoric%20migration%20and%20settlement%20of%20the%20Americas%20from%20Asia">arrival of humans</a>, and are native to the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>. The likely center of origin is southern Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to "<a href="Bryonia">Bryonia</a>", dates to the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. "C. moschata" can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become <a href="polyploid">polyploid</a>. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated "Cucurbita" are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the <a href="mitochondrial%20gene">mitochondrial gene</a> "<a href="nad1">nad1</a>" show there were at least six independent domestication events of "Cucurbita" separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include "<a href="Cucurbita%20digitata">C. digitata</a>" (calabazilla), and "C. foetidissima" (buffalo gourd), "<a href="Cucurbita%20palmata">C. palmata</a>" (coyote melon), and "C. pepo". Some species, such as "C. digitata" and "C. ficifolia," are referred to as "gourds". Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus "<a href="Lagenaria">Lagenaria</a>" and are native to Africa. "Lagenaria" are in the same family and subfamily as "Cucurbita" but in a different <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a>.

The earliest known evidence of the domestication of "Cucurbita" dates back at least 8,000 years ago, predating the domestication of other crops such as <a href="maize">maize</a> and <a href="bean">bean</a>s in the region by about 4,000 years. This evidence was found in the <a href="Guil%C3%A1%20Naquitz%20cave">Guilá Naquitz cave</a> in Oaxaca, Mexico, during a series of excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, possibly beginning in 1959. Solid evidence of domesticated "C. pepo" was found in the Guilá Naquitz cave in the form of increasing <a href="Peel%20%28fruit%29">rind</a> thickness and larger <a href="Peduncle%20%28botany%29">peduncles</a> in the newer <a href="Stratigraphy%20%28archaeology%29">stratification layers</a> of the cave. By c. 8,000 years <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a> the "C. pepo" peduncles found are consistently more than thick. Wild "Cucurbita" peduncles are always below this 10 mm barrier. Changes in fruit shape and color indicate that intentional breeding of "C. pepo" had occurred by no later than 8,000 years BP. During the same time frame, average rind thickness increased from to .

Squash was domesticated first, followed by maize and then beans, becoming part of the <a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28agriculture%29">Three Sisters agricultural system</a> of <a href="companion%20planting">companion planting</a>. The <a href="English%20language">English</a> word "squash" derives from "askutasquash" (a green thing eaten raw), a word from the <a href="Massachusett%20language">Narragansett</a> language, which was documented by <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a>, the founder of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, in his 1643 publication "<a href="A%20Key%20Into%20the%20Language%20of%20America">A Key Into the Language of America</a>". Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a> <a href="Language%20family">family</a>.

The family Cucurbitaceae has many species used as human food. "Cucurbita" species are some one of the most important of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and <a href="pepita">seeds</a> of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into <a href="pumpkin%20seed%20oil">pumpkin seed oil</a>, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.

Squashes are primarily grown for the fresh food market. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> (FAO) reported that the ranking of the top five squash-producing countries was stable between 2005 and 2009. Those countries are: China, India, Russia, the United States, and Egypt. By 2012, Iran had moved into the 5th slot, with Egypt falling to 6th. The top 10 countries in terms of <a href="Tonne">metric tons</a> of squashes produced are:

The only additional countries that rank in the top 20 where squashes are native are Cuba, which ranks 14th with 347,082 metric tons, and Argentina, which ranks 17th, with 326,900 metric tons. In addition to being the 4th largest producer of squashes in the world, the United States is the world's largest importer of squashes, importing 271,614 metric tons in 2011, 95 percent of that from Mexico. Within the United States, the states producing the largest amounts are Florida, New York, California, and North Carolina.
As an example of "Cucurbita", raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% <a href="carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a>, and 1% <a href="protein">protein</a>, with negligible <a href="fat">fat</a> content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 <a href="calories">calories</a> and is rich in <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> (20% of the <a href="Daily%20Value">Daily Value</a>, DV), moderate in <a href="vitamin%20B6">vitamin B6</a> and <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a> (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different "Curcubita" species may vary somewhat.

<a href="Pumpkin%20seed">Pumpkin seed</a>s contain <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a>, <a href="Protein%20%28nutrient%29%23Testing%20in%20foods">crude protein</a>, <a href="B%20vitamins">B vitamins</a> and several <a href="dietary%20minerals">dietary minerals</a> (see nutrition table at <a href="pepita">pepita</a>). Also present in pumpkin seeds are <a href="unsaturated%20fatty%20acid">unsaturated</a> and <a href="saturated%20fatty%20acid">saturated</a> oils, <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic</a>, <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic</a> and <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic</a> <a href="fatty%20acids">fatty acids</a>, as well as <a href="carotenoids">carotenoids</a>.

<a href="Cucurbitin">Cucurbitin</a> is an <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> and a <a href="carboxy">carboxy</a><a href="pyrrolidine">pyrrolidine</a> that is found in raw "Cucurbita" seeds. It retards the development of parasitic <a href="Trematoda">flukes</a> when administered to infected host mice, although the effect is only seen if administration begins immediately after infection.

<a href="Cucurmosin">Cucurmosin</a> is a <a href="ribosome%20inactivating%20protein">ribosome inactivating protein</a> found in the flesh and seed of "Cucurbita", notably "<a href="Cucurbita%20moschata">Cucurbita moschata</a>". Cucurmosin is more toxic to cancer cells than healthy cells.

<a href="Cucurbitacin">Cucurbitacin</a> is a <a href="steroid">plant steroid</a> present in wild "Cucurbita" and in each member of the family "Cucurbitaceae". Poisonous to mammals, it is found in quantities sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild "Cucurbita" and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional "C. fraterna" and "C. sororia", bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.

"Cucurbita" species are used as food plants by the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of some <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> species, including the <a href="Cabbage%20Moth">Cabbage Moth</a> ("Mamestra brassicae"), "<a href="Hypercompe%20indecisa">Hypercompe indecisa</a>", and the <a href="Turnip%20Moth">Turnip Moth</a> ("Agrotis segetum"). "Cucurbita" can be susceptible to the pest "Bemisia argentifolii" (<a href="silverleaf%20whitefly">silverleaf whitefly</a>) as well as aphids ("<a href="Aphididae">Aphididae</a>"), <a href="cucumber%20beetle">cucumber beetle</a>s ("Acalymma vittatum" and "<a href="Diabrotica%20undecimpunctata">Diabrotica undecimpunctata</a> howardi"), squash bug ("<a href="Anasa%20tristis">Anasa tristis</a>"), the <a href="squash%20vine%20borer">squash vine borer</a> ("Melittia cucurbitae"), and the twospotted spidermite ("<a href="Tetranychus%20urticae">Tetranychus urticae</a>"). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.
The <a href="red%20pumpkin%20beetle">red pumpkin beetle</a> ("Raphidopalpa foveicollis") is a serious pest of cucurbits, especially the pumpkin, which it can defoliate.
<a href="Cucurbitaceae">Cucurbits</a> are susceptible to diseases such as <a href="bacterial%20wilt">bacterial wilt</a> ("Erwinia tracheiphila"), anthracnose ("<a href="Colletotrichum">Colletotrichum</a>" spp.), fusarium wilt ("<a href="Fusarium">Fusarium</a>" spp.), phytophthora blight ("<a href="Phytophthora">Phytophthora</a>" spp. <a href="Oomycete">water molds</a>), and powdery mildew ("<a href="Erysiphe">Erysiphe</a>" spp.). <a href="Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory">Defensive responses</a> to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s do not involve cucurbitacin.

Species in the genus "Cucurbita" are susceptible to some types of <a href="mosaic%20virus">mosaic virus</a> including: <a href="Cucumber%20mosaic%20virus">Cucumber mosaic virus</a> (CMV), <a href="Papaya%20ringspot%20virus">Papaya ringspot virus</a>-cucurbit strain (PRSV), <a href="Squash%20mosaic%20virus">Squash mosaic virus</a> (SqMV), <a href="Tobacco%20ringspot%20virus">Tobacco ringspot virus</a> (TRSV), <a href="Watermelon%20mosaic%20virus">Watermelon mosaic virus</a> (WMV), and <a href="Zucchini%20yellow%20mosaic%20virus">Zucchini yellow mosaic virus</a> (ZYMV). PRSV is the only one of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants.

Long before European contact, "Cucurbita" had been a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas, and the species became an important food for European settlers, including the <a href="Pilgrims%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%29">Pilgrims</a>, even featuring at the first <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a>. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in <a href="pumpkin%20pie">pumpkin pie</a> is most often varieties of "C. moschata"; <a href="Libby%27s">Libby's</a>, by far the largest producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of "C. moschata" for its canned pumpkin. Other foods that can be made using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, <a href="granola">granola</a>, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. <a href="Squash%20soup">Squash soup</a> is a dish in African cuisine. The <a href="Xerophyte">xerophytic</a> species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions. "C. ficifolia" is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.

In India, squashes ("ghia") are cooked with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows ("courges") are traditionally served as a <a href="gratin">gratin</a>, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served in a variety of regional dishes, such as "cocuzze alla puviredda" cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a>; as "torta di zucca" from <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>, or "torta di zucca e riso" from <a href="Emilia-Romagna">Emilia-Romagna</a>, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, <a href="ricotta">ricotta</a>, <a href="parmesan">parmesan</a>, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like "spaghetti alle zucchine" from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small "C. moschata" pumpkins ("kabocha") are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a <a href="tempura">tempura</a> dish, or made into balls with <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a> and <a href="Japanese%20mountain%20yam">Japanese mountain yam</a>.

Along with maize and beans, squash has been depicted in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2,000 years. For example, cucurbits are often represented in <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> ceramics.

Though native to the western hemisphere, "Cucurbita" began to spread to other parts of the world after <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s arrival in the New World in 1492. Until recently, the earliest known depictions of this genus in Europe was of "Cucurbita pepo" in "<a href="De%20Historia%20Stirpium%20Commentarii%20Insignes">De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes</a>" in 1542 by the German botanist <a href="Leonhart%20Fuchs">Leonhart Fuchs</a>, but in 1992, two paintings, one of "C. pepo" and one of "C. maxima", painted between 1515 and 1518, were identified in <a href="festoon">festoon</a>s at <a href="Villa%20Farnesina">Villa Farnesina</a> in Rome. Also, in 2001 depictions of this genus were identified in "<a href="Grandes%20Heures%20of%20Anne%20of%20Brittany">Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany</a>" ("Les Grandes Heures d'Anne de Bretagne"), a French devotional book, an <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> created between 1503 and 1508. This book contains an illustration known as "Quegourdes de turquie", which was identified by cucurbit specialists as "C. pepo" subsp. "texana" in 2006.

In 1952, Stanley Smith Master, using the pen name Edrich Siebert, wrote "The Marrow Song (Oh what a beauty!)" to a tune in <a href="6/8%20time">time</a>. It became a popular hit in Australia in 1973, and was revived by <a href="the%20Wurzels">the Wurzels</a> in Britain on their 2003 album "Cutler of the West". <a href="John%20Greenleaf%20Whittier">John Greenleaf Whittier</a> wrote a poem entitled "The Pumpkin" in 1850. "The Great Pumpkin" is a fictional holiday figure in the <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" by <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schulz">Charles M. Schulz</a>.

"C. foetidissima" contains a <a href="saponin">saponin</a> that can be obtained from the fruit and root. This can be used as a soap, shampoo, and bleach. Prolonged contact can cause skin irritation.

"Cucurbita" have been used in various cultures as folk remedies. Pumpkins have been used by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors in the early nineteenth century as an <a href="anthelmintic">anthelmintic</a> for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of "C. pepo" were used to treat irritable bladder and <a href="benign%20prostatic%20hyperplasia">benign prostatic hyperplasia</a>. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the <a href="Commission%20E">Commission E</a>, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and <a href="micturition">micturition</a> problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The <a href="FDA">FDA</a> in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.

In China, <a href="Cucurbita%20moschata">"C. moschata"</a> seeds were also used in <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> for the treatment of the parasitic disease <a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a> and for the expulsion of <a href="tape%20worm">tape worm</a>s.

In Mexico, herbalists use "C. ficifolia" in the belief that it reduces <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a> levels.

"Cucurbita" fruits including pumpkins and marrows are celebrated in festivals in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Britain, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Argentina holds an annual nationwide pumpkin festival "Fiesta Nacional del Zapallo" ("Squashes and Pumpkins National Festival"), in <a href="Ceres%2C%20Santa%20Fe">Ceres, Santa Fe</a>, on the last day of which a "Reina Nacional del Zapallo" ("National Queen of the Pumpkin") is chosen. In Portugal the "Festival da Abóbora de Lourinhã e Atalaia" ("Squashes and Pumpkins Festival in <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3">Lourinhã</a> and <a href="Gavi%C3%A3o%20e%20Atalaia">Atalaia</a>") is held in Lourinhã city, called the "Capital Nacional da Abóbora" (the "National Capital of Squashes and Pumpkins"). <a href="Ludwigsburg">Ludwigsburg, Germany</a> annually hosts the world's largest pumpkin festival. In Britain a giant marrow (zucchini) weighing was displayed in the <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a> Autumn Flower Show in 2012.

Basiliscus

Basiliscus (; ; d. 476/477) was <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Emperor">Eastern Roman Emperor</a> from 475 to 476. A member of the <a href="House%20of%20Leo">House of Leo</a>, he came to power when Emperor <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Zeno</a> was forced out of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> by a revolt.

Basiliscus was the brother of Empress <a href="Verina">Aelia Verina</a>, who was the wife of Emperor <a href="Leo%20I%20%28emperor%29">Leo I</a> (457–474). His relationship with the Emperor allowed him to pursue a military career that, after minor initial successes, ended in 468, when he led the disastrous Roman invasion of <a href="Vandals">Vandal</a> Africa, in one of the largest military operations of <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>.

Basiliscus succeeded in seizing power in 475, exploiting the unpopularity of Emperor Zeno, the "barbarian" successor to Leo, and a plot organised by Verina that had caused Zeno to flee Constantinople. However, during his short rule, Basiliscus alienated the fundamental support of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Church</a> and the people of Constantinople, promoting the <a href="Miaphysitism">Miaphysite</a> <a href="christological">christological</a> position in opposition to the <a href="Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</a> faith. Also, his policy of securing his power through the appointment of loyal men to key roles antagonised many important figures in the imperial court, including his sister Verina. So, when Zeno tried to regain his empire, he found virtually no opposition, triumphantly entering Constantinople, and capturing and killing Basiliscus and his family.

The struggle between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>'s ability to intervene in the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">fall of the Western Roman Empire</a>, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a>, <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>, deposed Western Emperor <a href="Romulus%20Augustus">Romulus Augustus</a>, sending the imperial <a href="regalia">regalia</a> to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and was in no position to take any action but appoint Odoacer "<a href="dux">dux</a>" of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.

Likely of <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> origin, Basiliscus was the brother of <a href="Verina">Aelia Verina</a>, wife of <a href="Leo%20I%20%28emperor%29">Leo I</a>. It has been argued that Basiliscus was uncle to the chieftain of the Heruli, <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by <a href="John%20of%20Antioch">John of Antioch</a> (209.1), which states that Odoacer and <a href="Armatus">Armatus</a>, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, <a href="Zenonis">Zenonis</a>, and at least one son, <a href="Marcus%20%28son%20of%20Basiliscus%29">Marcus</a>.

Basiliscus' military career started under Leo I. The Emperor conferred upon his brother-in-law the dignities of "dux", or commander-in-chief, in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. In this country Basiliscus led a successful military campaign against the <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a> in 463. He succeeded Rusticius as "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a> per Thracias" (464), and had several successes against the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and <a href="Huns">Huns</a> (466 or 467).

Basiliscus's value rose in Leo's consideration. Verina's intercession in favour of her brother helped Basiliscus' military and political career, with the conferral of the <a href="Roman%20consul">consulship</a> in 465 and possibly of the rank of "<a href="Patrikios">patricius</a>". However, his rise was soon to meet a serious reversal.

In 468, Leo chose Basiliscus as leader of the famous military expedition against <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. All accounts agree that the invasion of the kingdom of the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> was one of the largest military undertakings recorded, although estimates of its exact size vary. According to <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a> and <a href="Nicephorus%20Gregoras">Nicephorus Gregoras</a>, 100,000 ships were assembled. Modern scholars consider <a href="Georgios%20Kedrenos">Cedrenus</a>'s figure of 1,113 vessels, each carrying 100 men, more likely. <a href="Peter%20Heather">Peter Heather</a> estimates a strength of 30,000 soldiers for the expedition and 50,000 total, when including sailors and the additional forces of <a href="Marcellinus%20%28general%29">Marcellinus</a> and <a href="Heraclius%20of%20Edessa">Heraclius of Edessa</a>. The most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000 pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue. The purpose of the operation was to punish the Vandal king <a href="Geiseric">Geiseric</a> for the <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28455%29">sacking of Rome in 455</a>, in which the former capital of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> was overwhelmed, and the Empress <a href="Licinia%20Eudoxia">Licinia Eudoxia</a> (widow of Emperor <a href="Valentinian%20III">Valentinian III</a>) and her daughters were taken as hostages.

The plan was concerted between Eastern Emperor Leo, Western Emperor <a href="Anthemius">Anthemius</a>, and General Marcellinus, who enjoyed independence in <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a>. Basiliscus was ordered to sail directly to Carthage, while Marcellinus attacked and took <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, and a third army, commanded by Heraclius, landed on the <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libyan</a> coast east of Carthage, making rapid progress. It appears that the combined forces met in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, whence the three fleets moved at different periods.

Sardinia and Libya were already conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the "Promontorium Mercurii", now <a href="Cap%20Bon">Cap Bon</a>, opposite Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus to allow him five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these <a href="fire%20ship">fire ship</a>s were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.

Basiliscus fled in the heat of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half followed the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into <a href="Tripolitania">Tripolitania</a>, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of <a href="Ricimer">Ricimer</a>, by one of his own captains, and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.

After returning to Constantinople, Basiliscus hid in the church of <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> to escape the wrath of the people and the revenge of the Emperor. By the mediation of Verina, Basiliscus obtained the Imperial pardon, and was punished merely with banishment to <a href="Heraclea%20Sintica">Heraclea Sintica</a>, in Thrace.

In 471 and 472, Basiliscus helped Leo I get rid of the Germanic influence in his court, helping in the murder of the <a href="Alans">Alan</a> "Magister militum" <a href="Aspar">Aspar</a>. The death of Aspar caused a revolt in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, led by the Thracian <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoth</a> <a href="Theodoric%20Strabo">Theodoric Strabo</a>, and Basiliscus was dispatched to suppress the revolt, something he successfully did with the aid of his nephew <a href="Armatus">Armatus</a>. In 474 he received the rank of "caput senatus", "first among the senators".

At the death of Leo, Zeno, who was a "barbarian" of <a href="Isauria">Isauria</a>n stock, but at the same time son-in-law of Leo, became sole Emperor, after a short co-reign with his own son <a href="Leo%20II%20%28emperor%29">Leo II</a> (474). The "barbarian" origins of the Emperor caused antipathy towards Zeno among the people of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Furthermore, the strong Germanic portion of the military, led by Theodoric Strabo, disliked the Isaurian officers that Leo I brought to reduce his dependency on the Ostrogoths. Finally, Zeno alienated his fellow Isaurian general <a href="Illus">Illus</a>, who was bribed by Basiliscus. In the middle of the conspiracy was Verina, who fomented a popular revolt against the Emperor. The uprising, supported by Theodoric Strabo, Illus and Armatus, was successful, and Verina convinced the Emperor to leave the city. Zeno fled to his native lands, bringing with him some of the Isaurians living in Constantinople, and the Imperial treasury. Basiliscus was then acclaimed as "Augustus" on 9 January 475 at the <a href="Hebdomon">Hebdomon</a> palace, by the palace ministers and the Senate. The mob of Constantinople got its revenge against Zeno, killing almost all of the Isaurians left in the city.

In the beginning, everything seemed to go well for the new Emperor, who even tried to set up a new dynasty by conferring the title of <a href="Augusta%20%28honorific%29">"Augusta"</a> upon his wife Aelia Zenonis and naming his son Marcus <a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">"Caesar"</a>, and later <a href="Augustus%20%28title%29">"Augustus"</a>; however, due to his mismanagement as emperor, Basiliscus quickly lost most of his supporters.

The most urgent problem facing the new Emperor was the scarcity of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to revert to the practice of auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, with the help of the Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.

Early in his reign, Constantinople suffered a massive fire, which destroyed houses, churches, and completely incinerated the huge library built by Emperor <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian</a>. The fire was seen as a bad omen for the rule of Basiliscus.

Basiliscus had relied on the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina, executing the "<a href="Magister%20officiorum">Magister officiorum</a>" Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus.

Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose hatred of the Isaurian Zeno had compelled him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus had in fact raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, to the rank of "magister militum", the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.

In that time, the Christian faith was shaken by the conflict between <a href="Miaphysitism">Miaphysites</a> and <a href="Chalcedonian">Chalcedonian</a>s, representing two opposing <a href="christological">christological</a> positions: the Chalcedonians claimed that <a href="Christ">Christ</a> had both human and divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one nature. The <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a>, convoked by Emperor <a href="Marcian">Marcian</a> in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, with the support of the pope in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs <a href="Pope%20Timothy%20II%20of%20Alexandria">Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria</a> and <a href="Peter%20the%20Fuller">Peter the Fuller</a> of <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> were deposed.

From the beginning of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. <a href="Zacharias%20Scholasticus">Zacharias Scholasticus</a> reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had traveled from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but, on their arrival in the capital, they found the newly-elected Basiliscus instead. The "Magister Officiorum" Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.

Basiliscus re-instated Timothy Aelurus and Peter the Fuller to their sees, and, persuaded by the former, issued a circular letter ("Enkyklikon") on 9 April 475 to the bishops calling them to accept as valid only the first three ecumenical synods, and reject the Council of Chalcedon. All bishops were to sign the edict. While most of the Eastern bishops accepted the letter, <a href="Patriarch%20Acacius%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople</a> refused, with the support of the population of the city, clearly showing his disdain towards Basiliscus by draping the <a href="icon">icon</a>s in Hagia Sophia in black.

Soon after his elevation, Basiliscus had despatched Illus and his brother <a href="Trocundus">Trocundus</a> against Zeno, who, now in his native fortresses, had resumed the life of an Isaurian chieftain. Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court, urging them to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now preferred a restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.

During his operations in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother Longinus prisoner and kept him in an Isaurian fortress. Because he thought he would have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.

Armatus, as "magister militum", was sent with all available forces in Asia Minor, to oppose the advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised to give him the title of "magister militum" for life and to confer the rank of "Caesar" on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.

In August 476, Zeno besieged Constantinople.
The Senate opened the gates of the city to the Isaurian, allowing the deposed emperor to resume the throne. Basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church, but he was betrayed by Acacius and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus, his wife Aelia Zenonis and his son Marcus were sent to a fortress in <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry <a href="cistern">cistern</a>, to die from exposure.

Basiliscus had ruled for twenty months. He is described by sources as a successful general, but slow of understanding and easy to deceive.

Flag of Japan

The national flag of Japan is a rectangular white banner bearing a crimson-red disc at its center. This flag is officially called , but is more commonly known in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> as . It embodies the country's <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a>: <a href="Land%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun">Land of the Rising Sun</a>.

The "Nisshōki" flag is designated as the national flag in the <a href="Act%20on%20National%20Flag%20and%20Anthem%20%28Japan%29">Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem</a>, which was promulgated and became effective on August 13, 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a national flag, the sun-disc flag had already become the "de facto" national flag of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the <a href="Daij%C5%8D-kan">Daijō-kan</a>, the governmental body of the early <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a>, each had a provision for a design of the national flag. A sun-disc flag was adopted as the national flag for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on February 27, 1870), and as the national flag used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on October 27, 1870). Use of the "Hinomaru" was severely restricted during the early years of the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Japan">Allied occupation of Japan</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; these restrictions were later relaxed.

The sun plays an important role in <a href="Japanese%20mythology">Japanese mythology</a> and religion as the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> is said to be the <a href="Japanese%20imperial%20family%20tree">direct descendant</a> of the sun goddess <a href="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a> and the legitimacy of the <a href="Imperial%20House%20of%20Japan">ruling house</a> rested on this divine appointment and <a href="Japanese%20imperial%20family%20tree">descent</a> from the chief deity of the predominant <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> religion. The <a href="Names%20of%20Japan">name of the country</a> as well as the design of the flag reflect this central importance of the sun. The ancient history <a href="Shoku%20Nihongi">Shoku Nihongi</a> says that <a href="Emperor%20Monmu">Emperor Monmu</a> used a flag representing the sun in his court in 701, and this is the first recorded use of a sun-motif flag in Japan. The oldest existing flag is preserved in Unpō-ji temple, <a href="K%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%2C%20Yamanashi">Kōshū, Yamanashi</a>, which is older than the 16th century, and an ancient legend says that the flag was given to the temple by <a href="Emperor%20Go-Reizei">Emperor Go-Reizei</a> in the 11th century. During the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>, both the sun disc and the <a href="Rising%20Sun%20Flag">Rising Sun Ensign</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> became major symbols in the emerging <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese Empire</a>. Propaganda posters, textbooks, and films depicted the flag as a source of pride and patriotism. In Japanese homes, citizens were required to display the flag during national holidays, celebrations and other occasions as decreed by the government. Different tokens of devotion to Japan and its Emperor featuring the "Hinomaru" motif became popular during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> and other conflicts. These tokens ranged from slogans written on the flag to clothing items and dishes that resembled the flag.

Public perception of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>), the use of the flag and the national anthem "<a href="Kimigayo">Kimigayo</a>" has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with <a href="ultranationalism">ultranationalism</a>. To some <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>ns, the flag represents the events of World War II and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>. The "Hinomaru" was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20flags%23Military">military banners of Japan</a> are based on the "Hinomaru", including the sunrayed naval ensign. The "Hinomaru" also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.

The exact origin of the "Hinomaru" is unknown, but the rising sun seems to have had some symbolic meaning since the early 7th century (the Japanese archipelago is east of the Asian mainland, and is thus where the sun "rises"). In 607, an official correspondence that began with "from the Emperor of the rising sun" was sent to Chinese <a href="Emperor%20Yang%20of%20Sui">Emperor Yang of Sui</a>. Japan is often referred to as "the land of the rising sun". In the 12th-century work, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20the%20Heike">The Tale of the Heike</a>", it was written that different <a href="samurai">samurai</a> carried drawings of the sun on their fans. One legend related to the national flag is attributed to the <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> priest <a href="Nichiren">Nichiren</a>. Supposedly, during a 13th-century <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>n invasion of Japan, Nichiren gave a sun banner to the "<a href="sh%C5%8Dgun">shōgun</a>" to carry into battle. The sun is also closely related to the <a href="Imperial%20House%20of%20Japan">Imperial family</a>, as legend states the imperial throne was descended from the sun goddess <a href="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a>.

One of Japan's oldest flags is housed at the Unpo-ji temple in <a href="Yamanashi%20Prefecture">Yamanashi Prefecture</a>. Legend states it was given by <a href="Emperor%20Go-Reizei">Emperor Go-Reizei</a> to <a href="Minamoto%20no%20Yoshimitsu">Minamoto no Yoshimitsu</a> and has been treated as a family treasure by the <a href="Takeda%20clan">Takeda clan</a> for the past 1,000 years, and at least it is older than 16th century.

The earliest recorded flags in Japan date from the <a href="Azuchi%E2%80%93Momoyama%20period">unification period</a> in the late 16th century. The flags belonged to each "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>" and were used primarily in battle. Most of the flags were long banners usually charged with the <a href="mon%20%28badge%29">mon</a> (family crest) of the "daimyō" lord. Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, had different flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on their backs and horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.

In 1854, during the <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">Tokugawa shogunate</a>, Japanese ships were ordered to hoist the "Hinomaru" to distinguish themselves from foreign ships. Before then, different types of "Hinomaru" flags were used on vessels that were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The "Hinomaru" was decreed the merchant flag of Japan in 1870 and was the legal national flag from 1870 to 1885, making it the first national flag Japan adopted.

While the idea of national symbols was strange to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them to communicate with the outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Matthew Perry</a> in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem "Kimigayo" and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the "Hinomaru" was the "de facto" national flag since no law was in place after the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>.

The use of the national flag grew as Japan sought to develop an empire, and the "Hinomaru" was present at celebrations after victories in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese</a> and <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>s. The flag was also used in war efforts throughout the country. A Japanese propaganda film in 1934 portrayed foreign national flags as incomplete or defective with their designs, while the Japanese flag is perfect in all forms. In 1937, a group of girls from <a href="Hiroshima%20Prefecture">Hiroshima Prefecture</a> showed solidarity with Japanese soldiers fighting in China during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, by eating "flag meals" that consisted of an <a href="umeboshi">umeboshi</a> in the middle of a bed of rice. The "Hinomaru <a href="bento">bento</a>" became the main symbol of Japan's war mobilization and solidarity with her soldiers until the 1940s.

Japan's early victories in the Sino-Japanese War resulted in the "Hinomaru" again being used for celebrations. It was seen in the hands of every Japanese during parades.

Textbooks during this period also had the "Hinomaru" printed with various slogans expressing devotion to the Emperor and the country. Patriotism was taught as a virtue to Japanese children. Expressions of patriotism, such as displaying the flag or worshiping the Emperor daily, were all part of being a "good Japanese."

The flag was a tool of Japanese imperialism in the occupied Southeast Asian areas during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>: people had to use the flag, and schoolchildren sang "Kimigayo" in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the <a href="Second%20Philippine%20Republic">Philippines</a>, <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Indonesia</a>, and <a href="Manchukuo">Manchukuo</a>. In <a href="Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule">Korea</a> which was part of the Empire of Japan, the "Hinomaru" and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.

To the Japanese, the "Hinomaru" was the "Rising Sun flag that would light the darkness of the entire world." To Westerners, it was one of the Japanese military's most powerful symbols.

The "Hinomaru" was the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" flag of Japan throughout World War II and the occupation period. During the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> after <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, permission from the <a href="Supreme%20Commander%20of%20the%20Allied%20Powers">Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers</a> (SCAPJ) was needed to fly the "Hinomaru". Sources differ on the degree to which the use of the "Hinomaru" flag was restricted; some use the term "banned;" however, while the original restrictions were severe, they did not amount to an outright ban.

After World War II, an <a href="ensign">ensign</a> was used by Japanese civil ships of the United States Naval Shipping Control Authority for Japanese Merchant Marines. Modified from the "E" <a href="International%20maritime%20signal%20flags">signal code</a>, the ensign was used from September 1945 until the U.S. occupation of Japan ceased. U.S. ships operating in Japanese waters used a modified "O" signal flag as their ensign.

On May 2, 1947, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> lifted the restrictions on displaying the "Hinomaru" in the grounds of the <a href="National%20Diet%20Building">National Diet Building</a>, on the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Imperial Palace</a>, on the <a href="Kantei">Prime Minister's residence</a> and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Japan">Constitution of Japan</a>. Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could fly the "Hinomaru" at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the "Hinomaru" until the early 1950s.

Since World War II, Japan's flag has been criticized for its association with the country's <a href="militarism">militaristic</a> past. Similar objections have also been raised to the current national anthem of Japan, "<a href="Kimigayo">Kimigayo</a>". The feelings about the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo" represented a general shift from a patriotic feeling about "Dai Nippon" – Great Japan – to the pacifist and anti-militarist "Nihon". Because of this ideological shift, the flag was used less often in Japan directly after the war even though restrictions were lifted by the SCAPJ in 1949.

As Japan began to re-establish itself diplomatically, the "Hinomaru" was used as a political weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> and the <a href="Empress%20K%C5%8Djun">Empress Kōjun</a> to the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the "Hinomaru" was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new <a href="Status%20of%20Forces%20Agreement">Status of Forces Agreement</a> being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the <a href="red%20flag%20%28politics%29">red flag</a> of revolt.

An issue with the "Hinomaru" and national anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympic Games</a>. Before the Olympic Games, the size of the sun disc of the national flag was changed partly because the sun disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set the sun disc at two thirds of the flag's length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a> in Nagano.

In 1989, the death of Emperor <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> once again raised moral issues about the national flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might have a chance to propose that the "Hinomaru" become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the "Hinomaru" on the day of the Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at <a href="half-staff">half-staff</a> without reservations brought success to the conservatives.

The "<a href="Act%20on%20National%20Flag%20and%20Anthem%20%28Japan%29">Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem</a>" was passed in 1999, choosing both the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo" as Japan's national symbols. The passage of the law stemmed from a suicide of the principal of in <a href="Sera%2C%20Hiroshima">Sera</a>, <a href="Hiroshima%20Prefecture">Hiroshima</a>, Toshihiro Ishikawa, who could not resolve a dispute between his school board and his teachers over the use of the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo". The Act is one of the most controversial laws passed by the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet</a> since the 1992 "Law Concerning Cooperation for United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and Other Operations", also known as the "International Peace Cooperation Law".

<a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Keiz%C5%8D%20Obuchi">Keizō Obuchi</a> of the <a href="Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29">Liberal Democratic Party</a> (LDP) decided to draft legislation to make the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo" official symbols of Japan in 2000. His <a href="Chief%20Cabinet%20Secretary">Chief Cabinet Secretary</a>, <a href="Hiromu%20Nonaka">Hiromu Nonaka</a>, wanted the legislation to be completed by the 10th anniversary of Emperor <a href="Akihito">Akihito</a>'s <a href="Enthronement%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Emperor">enthronement</a>. This is not the first time legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Kakuei%20Tanaka">Kakuei Tanaka</a> hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play "Kimigayo", Tanaka wanted students to raise the "Hinomaru" flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the <a href="Imperial%20Rescript%20on%20Education">Imperial Rescript on Education</a> pronounced by the <a href="Meiji%20Emperor">Meiji Emperor</a> in 1890. Tanaka was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.

Main supporters of the bill were the LDP and the <a href="Komeito">Komeito</a> (CGP), while the opposition included the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDPJ) and <a href="Japanese%20Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a> (JCP), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue to be decided by the public. Meanwhile, the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20Japan">Democratic Party of Japan</a> (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. DPJ President and future prime minister <a href="Naoto%20Kan">Naoto Kan</a> stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister <a href="Yukio%20Hatoyama">Yukio Hatoyama</a> thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools. Hatoyama voted for the bill while Kan voted against it.

Before the vote, there were calls for the bills to be separated at the Diet. <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> professor Norihiro Kato stated that "Kimigayo" is a separate issue more complex than the "Hinomaru" flag. Attempts to designate only the "Hinomaru" as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.

On August 8, 2009, a photograph was taken at a DPJ rally for the <a href="Japanese%20general%20election%2C%202009">House of Representatives election</a> showing a banner that was hanging from a ceiling. The banner was made of two "Hinomaru" flags cut and sewn together to form the shape of the DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister <a href="Tar%C5%8D%20As%C5%8D">Tarō Asō</a>, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the "Hinomaru" and should not be regarded as such.

Passed in 1870, the Prime Minister's Proclamation No. 57 had two provisions related to the national flag. The first provision specified who flew the flag and how it was flown; the second specified how the flag was made. The ratio was seven units width and ten units length (7:10). The red disc, which represents the sun, was calculated to be three-fifths of the <a href="Flag%20terminology">hoist width</a>. The law decreed the disc to be in the center, but it was usually placed one-hundredth () towards the hoist. On October 3 of the same year, regulations about the design of the merchant ensign and other naval flags were passed. For the merchant flag, the ratio was two units width and three units length (2:3). The size of the disc remained the same, but the sun disc was placed one-twentieth () towards the hoist.
When the "<a href="Act%20on%20National%20Flag%20and%20Anthem%20%28Japan%29">Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem</a>" passed, the dimensions of the flag were slightly altered. The overall ratio of the flag was changed to two units width by three units length (2:3). The red disc was shifted towards the center, but the overall size of the disc stayed the same. The background of the flag is white and the sun disc is , but the exact color shades were not defined in the 1999 law. The only hint given about the red color that it is a "deep" shade.

Issued by the Japan Defense Agency (now the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Japan%29">Ministry of Defense</a>) in 1973 (<a href="Sh%C5%8Dwa%20period">Showa</a> 48), specifications list the red color of the flag as 5R 4/12 and the white as N9 in the <a href="Munsell%20color">Munsell color</a> chart. The document was changed on March 21, 2008 (<a href="Heisei">Heisei</a> 20) to match the flag's construction with current legislation and updated the Munsell colors. The document lists <a href="acrylic%20fiber">acrylic fiber</a> and <a href="nylon">nylon</a> as fibers that could be used in construction of flags used by the military. For acrylic, the red color is 5.7R 3.7/15.5 and white is N9.4; nylon has 6.2R 4/15.2 for red and N9.2 for white. In a document issued by the <a href="Official%20Development%20Assistance%20%28Japan%29">Official Development Assistance</a> (ODA), the red color for the "Hinomaru" and the ODA logo is listed as <a href="Dainippon%20Ink%20%26amp%3B%20Chemicals">DIC</a> 156 and <a href="CMYK%20color%20model">CMYK</a> 0-100-90-0. During deliberations about the "Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem", there was a suggestion to either use a shade or use one from the color pool of the <a href="Japanese%20Industrial%20Standards">Japanese Industrial Standards</a>. Japanese flags produced in Japan often use <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a> dye.

When the "Hinomaru" was first introduced, the government required citizens to greet the Emperor with the flag. There was some resentment among the Japanese over the flag, resulting in some protests. It took some time for the flag to gain acceptance among the people.

During World War II in Japanese culture, it was a popular custom for friends, classmates, and relatives of a deploying soldier to sign a "Hinomaru" and present it to him. The flag was also used as a good luck charm and a prayer to wish the soldier back safely from battle. One term for this kind of charm is . One tradition is that no writing should touch the sun disc. After battles, these flags were often captured or later found on deceased Japanese soldiers. While these flags became souvenirs, there has been a growing trend of sending the signed flags back to the descendants of the soldier. The tradition of signing the "Hinomaru" as a good luck charm still continues, though in a limited fashion. The "Hinomaru Yosegaki" could be shown at sporting events to give support to the Japanese national team. 

The is a white <a href="headband">headband</a> (<a href="bandana">bandana</a>) with the red sun in the middle. Phrases are usually written on it. It is worn as a symbol of <a href="Courage">perseverance</a>, effort, and/or <a href="courage">courage</a> by the wearer. These are worn on many occasions by for example sports spectators, women giving birth, students in <a href="juku">cram school</a>, office workers, tradesmen taking pride in their work etc. During World War II, the phrases or "Seven Lives" was written on the "hachimaki" and worn by <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> pilots. This denoted that the pilot was willing to die for his country.

Before World War II, all homes were required to display "Hinomaru" on national holidays. Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the "Hinomaru" during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since <a href="The%20Emperor%27s%20Birthday">the Emperor's 80th Birthday</a> on December 23, 2002, the <a href="Kyushu%20Railway%20Company">Kyushu Railway Company</a> has displayed the "Hinomaru" at 330 stations.

Starting in 1995, the ODA has used the "Hinomaru" motif in their official logo. The design itself was not created by the government (the logo was chosen from 5,000 designs submitted by the public) but the government was trying increase the visualization of the "Hinomaru" through their aid packages and development programs. According to the ODA, the use of the flag is the most effective way to symbolize aid provided by the Japanese people.

According to polls conducted by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived the flag of Japan as the national flag even before the passage of the "<a href="Act%20on%20National%20Flag%20and%20Anthem%20%28Japan%29">Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem</a>" in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as "<a href="Asahi%20Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a>" and "<a href="Mainichi%20Shimbun">Mainichi Shimbun</a>" often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan was an empire</a>.

The display of the national flag at homes and businesses is also debated in Japanese society. Because of its association with <a href="uyoku%20dantai">uyoku dantai</a> (right wing) activists, <a href="Reactionary">reactionary politics</a>, or <a href="hooliganism">hooliganism</a>, some homes and businesses do not fly the flag. There is no requirement to fly the flag on any national holiday or special events. The town of <a href="Kanazawa%2C%20Ishikawa">Kanazawa, Ishikawa</a>, has proposed plans in September 2012 to use government funds to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to fly the flag on national holidays. The <a href="Japanese%20Communist%20Party">Japanese Communist Party</a> is vocally against the flag.

Negative perceptions of the national flag exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa</a>. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner <a href="flag%20burning">burned</a> the flag before the start of the <a href="National%20Sports%20Festival%20of%20Japan">National Sports Festival of Japan</a>. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the "Hinomaru" not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of "<a href="Kimigayo">Kimigayo</a>". In the capital city of <a href="Naha%2C%20Okinawa">Naha, Okinawa</a>, the "Hinomaru" was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the "Hinomaru" was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the <a href="Yasukuni%20Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a>, U.S.-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views as they have mainly adopted some form of Japanese culture through anime and games and <a href="Uniqlo">Uniqlo</a>. The Philippine government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the "Hinomaru", but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan.

According to protocol, the flag may fly from sunrise until sunset; businesses and schools are permitted to fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and the flag of the guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the same height and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The "Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem" does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the "Hinomaru" and other prefectural flags.

The "Hinomaru" flag has at least two mourning styles. One is to display the flag at , as is common in many countries. The offices of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> also hoist the flag at half-staff when a funeral is performed for a foreign nation's head of state.

An alternative mourning style is to wrap the spherical <a href="finial">finial</a> with black cloth and place a black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style dates back to the death of <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.
Since the end of World War II, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%2C%20Culture%2C%20Sports%2C%20Science%20and%20Technology%20%28Japan%29">Ministry of Education</a> has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo" at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect must be given to it and to "Kimigayo". Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.

The 1999 <a href="curriculum%20guideline">curriculum guideline</a> issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the "Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem" decrees that "on entrance and graduation ceremonies, schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing the "<a href="Kimigayo">Kimigayo</a>" (national anthem), given the significance of the flag and the song." Additionally, the ministry's commentary on the 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools note that "given the advance of internationalization, along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese, it is important to nurture school children's respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and "Kimigayo" as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society." The ministry also stated that if Japanese students cannot respect their own symbols, then they will not be able to respect the symbols of other nations.

<a href="Education%20in%20Japan">Schools</a> have been the center of controversy over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education requires the use of both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Japan">Constitution of Japan</a>, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the "Hinomaru" at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor <a href="Shintar%C5%8D%20Ishihara">Shintarō Ishihara</a> and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the "Hinomaru" and "Kimigayo". After earlier opposition, the <a href="Japan%20Teachers%20Union">Japan Teachers Union</a> accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.

The <a href="Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a> (JSDF) and the <a href="Japan%20Ground%20Self-Defense%20Force">Japan Ground Self-Defense Force</a> use Rising Sun Flag with eight red rays extending outward, called . A gold border lies partially around the edge.

A well-known variant of the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a <a href="Siemens%20star">Siemens star</a> formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the <a href="War%20flag">War flag</a> on May 15, 1870, and was used until the end of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the <a href="Japan%20Maritime%20Self-Defense%20Force">Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force</a> (JMSDF). <a href="Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces">JSDF</a> Chief of Staff <a href="Katsutoshi%20Kawano">Katsutoshi Kawano</a> said the Rising Sun Flag is the Maritime Self-Defense Force sailors' "pride". Due to its use by the Imperial Japanese Army, this flag carries a negative connotation in China and Korea. They often claim that this flag is a symbol associated with Japanese imperialism during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The JMSDF also employs the use of a <a href="masthead%20pennant">masthead pennant</a>. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, with the rest of the pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.

The <a href="Japan%20Air%20Self-Defense%20Force">Japan Air Self-Defense Force</a> (JASDF), established independently in 1952, has only the plain sun disc as its emblem. This is the only branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an <a href="ensign">ensign</a> to fly on bases and during parades. The ensign was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The ensign contains the emblem of the branch centered on a blue background.

Although not an official national flag, the <a href="Z%20flag">Z signal flag</a> played a major role in Japanese naval history. On May 27, 1905, Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Heihachirō Tōgō</a> of the "<a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Mikasa">Mikasa</a>" was preparing to engage the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Russian Baltic Fleet</a>. Before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> began, Togo raised the Z flag on the "Mikasa" and engaged the Russian fleet, winning the battle for Japan. The raising of the flag said to the crew the following: "The fate of Imperial Japan hangs on this one battle; all hands will exert themselves and do their best." The Z flag was also raised on the aircraft carrier "<a href="Japanese%20aircraft%20carrier%20Akagi">Akagi</a>" on the eve of the Japan's attack on <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, in December 1941.

Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a>), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored <a href="chrysanthemum">chrysanthemum</a>, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.

The current Emperor's flag is a 16-petal chrysanthemum, colored in gold, centered on a red background with a 2:3 ratio. The Empress uses the same flag, except the shape is that of a swallow tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, except with a smaller chrysanthemum and a white border in the middle of the flags. The chrysanthemum has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of <a href="Emperor%20Go-Toba">Emperor Go-Toba</a> in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive <a href="Imperial%20Seal%20of%20Japan">symbol of the Imperial throne</a> until 1868.

Each of the <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">47 prefectures</a> of Japan has its <a href="List%20of%20flags%20of%20Japanese%20prefectures">own flag</a> which, like the national flag, consists of a symbol – called a "<a href="mon%20%28badge%29">mon</a>" – charged upon a monocolored field (except for <a href="Ehime%20Prefecture">Ehime Prefecture</a>, where the background is bicolored). There are several prefecture flags, such as <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>'s, that match their specifications to the national flag (2:3 ratio, "mon" placed in the center and is the length of the flag). Some of the "mon" display the name of the prefecture in <a href="Japanese%20writing%20system">Japanese characters</a>; others are stylized depictions of the location or another special feature of the prefecture. An example of a prefectural flag is that of <a href="Nagano%20Prefecture">Nagano</a>, where the orange "<a href="katakana">katakana</a>" character ナ ("na") appears in the center of a white disc. One interpretation of the "mon" is that the "na" symbol represents a mountain and the white disc, a lake. The orange color represents the sun while the white color represents the snow of the region.

<a href="Municipalities%20of%20Japan">Municipalities</a> can also adopt flags of their own. The designs of the city flags are similar to the prefectural flags: a "mon" on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of <a href="Amakusa%2C%20Kumamoto">Amakusa</a> in <a href="Kumamoto%20Prefecture">Kumamoto Prefecture</a>: the city symbol is composed of the <a href="Katakana">Katakana</a> character ア ("a") and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.

In addition to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former <a href="Japan%20Post">Japan Post</a> flag consisted of the "Hinomaru" with a red horizontal bar placed in the center of the flag. There was also a thin white ring around the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the <a href="Japan%20postal%20mark">〒 postal mark</a> in red on a white background.

Two recently designed national flags resemble the Japanese flag. In 1971, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> gained independence from <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="Flag%20of%20Bangladesh">it adopted a national flag</a> that had a green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of <a href="Palau">Palau</a> uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The <a href="flag%20of%20Palau">flag of Palau</a> is an off-centered golden-yellow <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a> on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.

The Japanese naval ensign also influenced other flag designs. One such flag design is used by the "<a href="Asahi%20Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a>". At the bottom hoist of the flag, one quarter of the sun is displayed. The <a href="kanji">kanji</a> character <a href="%3Awiktionary%3A%E6%9C%9D">朝</a> is displayed on the flag, colored white, covering most of the sun. The rays extend from the sun, occurring in a red and white alternating order, culminating in 13 total stripes. The flag is commonly seen at the <a href="Japanese%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Championship">National High School Baseball Championship</a>, as the "Asahi Shimbun" is a main sponsor of the tournament. The rank flags and ensigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy also based their designs on the naval ensign.

Parallel computing

Parallel computing is a type of <a href="computing">computation</a> in which many calculations or the execution of <a href="Process%20%28computing%29">process</a>es are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: <a href="Bit-level%20parallelism">bit-level</a>, <a href="Instruction-level%20parallelism">instruction-level</a>, <a href="Data%20parallelism">data</a>, and <a href="task%20parallelism">task parallelism</a>. Parallelism has long been employed in <a href="high-performance%20computing">high-performance computing</a>, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing <a href="frequency%20scaling">frequency scaling</a>. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a>, mainly in the form of <a href="multi-core%20processor">multi-core processor</a>s.

Parallel computing is closely related to <a href="concurrent%20computing">concurrent computing</a>—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as <a href="bit-level%20parallelism">bit-level parallelism</a>), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a> on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down into several, often many, very similar sub-tasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in <a href="distributed%20computing">distributed computing</a>, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some <a href="inter-process%20communication">inter-process communication</a> during execution.

Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with <a href="multi-core">multi-core</a> and <a href="Symmetric%20multiprocessing">multi-processor</a> computers having multiple <a href="processing%20element">processing element</a>s within a single machine, while <a href="Computer%20cluster">clusters</a>, <a href="Massively%20parallel%20%28computing%29">MPPs</a>, and <a href="Grid%20computing">grids</a> use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.

In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly <a href="parallel%20algorithm">parallel algorithm</a>s, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s, of which <a href="race%20condition">race condition</a>s are the most common. <a href="Computer%20networking">Communication</a> and <a href="Synchronization%20%28computer%20science%29">synchronization</a> between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

A theoretical <a href="upper%20bound">upper bound</a> on the <a href="Speedup">speed-up</a> of a single program as a result of parallelization is given by <a href="Amdahl%27s%20law">Amdahl's law</a>.

Traditionally, <a href="computer%20software">computer software</a> has been written for <a href="serial%20computation">serial computation</a>. To solve a problem, an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.

Parallel computing, on the other hand, uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This is accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above. Historically parallel computing was used for scientific computing and the simulation of scientific problems, particularly in the natural and engineering sciences, such as <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>. This led to the design of parallel hardware and software, as well as <a href="high%20performance%20computing">high performance computing</a>.

<a href="Frequency%20scaling">Frequency scaling</a> was the dominant reason for improvements in <a href="computer%20performance">computer performance</a> from the mid-1980s until 2004. The <a href="Run%20time%20%28program%20lifecycle%20phase%29">runtime</a> of a program is equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all <a href="CPU%20bound">compute-bound</a> programs. However, power consumption "P" by a chip is given by the equation "P" = "C" × "V" × "F", where "C" is the <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a> being switched per clock cycle (proportional to the number of transistors whose inputs change), "V" is <a href="voltage">voltage</a>, and "F" is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately to <a href="Intel">Intel</a>'s May 8, 2004 cancellation of its <a href="Tejas%20and%20Jayhawk">Tejas and Jayhawk</a> processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.

To deal with the problem of power consumption and overheating the major <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> (CPU or processor) manufacturers started to produce power efficient processors with multiple cores. The core is the computing unit of the processor and in multi-core processors each core is independent and can access the same memory concurrently. <a href="Multi-core%20processor">Multi-core processor</a>s have brought parallel computing to <a href="desktop%20computers">desktop computers</a>. Thus parallelisation of serial programmes has become a mainstream programming task. In 2012 quad-core processors became standard for <a href="desktop%20computers">desktop computers</a>, while <a href="Server%20%28computing%29">servers</a> have 10 and 12 core processors. From <a href="Moore%27s%20law">Moore's law</a> it can be predicted that the number of cores per processor will double every 18–24 months. This could mean that after 2020 a typical processor will have dozens or hundreds of cores.

An <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> can ensure that different tasks and user programmes are run in parallel on the available cores. However, for a serial software programme to take full advantage of the multi-core architecture the programmer needs to restructure and parallelise the code. A speed-up of application software runtime will no longer be achieved through frequency scaling, instead programmers will need to parallelise their software code to take advantage of the increasing computing power of multicore architectures.

Optimally, the <a href="speedup">speedup</a> from parallelization would be linear—doubling the number of processing elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most of them have a near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.

The potential speedup of an algorithm on a parallel computing platform is given by <a href="Amdahl%27s%20law">Amdahl's law</a>
where
Since , it shows that a small part of the program which cannot be parallelized will limit the overall speedup available from parallelization. A program solving a large mathematical or engineering problem will typically consist of several parallelizable parts and several non-parallelizable (serial) parts. If the non-parallelizable part of a program accounts for 10% of the runtime ("p" = 0.9), we can get no more than a 10 times speedup, regardless of how many processors are added. This puts an upper limit on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units. "When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned."

Amdahl's law only applies to cases where the problem size is fixed. In practice, as more computing resources become available, they tend to get used on larger problems (larger datasets), and the time spent in the parallelizable part often grows much faster than the inherently serial work. In this case, <a href="Gustafson%27s%20law">Gustafson's law</a> gives a less pessimistic and more realistic assessment of parallel performance:

Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law assume that the running time of the serial part of the program is independent of the number of processors. Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work to be done in parallel is also "independent of the number of processors", whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to be done in parallel "varies linearly with the number of processors".

Understanding <a href="data%20dependency">data dependencies</a> is fundamental in implementing <a href="parallel%20algorithm">parallel algorithm</a>s. No program can run more quickly than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the <a href="Critical%20path%20method">critical path</a>), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.

Let "P" and "P" be two program segments. Bernstein's conditions describe when the two are independent and can be executed in parallel. For "P", let "I" be all of the input variables and "O" the output variables, and likewise for "P". "P" and "P" are independent if they satisfy

Violation of the first condition introduces a flow dependency, corresponding to the first segment producing a result used by the second segment. The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment produces a variable needed by the first segment. The third and final condition represents an output dependency: when two segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.

Consider the following functions, which demonstrate several kinds of dependencies:

In this example, instruction 3 cannot be executed before (or even in parallel with) instruction 2, because instruction 3 uses a result from instruction 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.

In this example, there are no dependencies between the instructions, so they can all be run in parallel.

Bernstein's conditions do not allow memory to be shared between different processes. For that, some means of enforcing an ordering between accesses is necessary, such as <a href="Semaphore%20%28programming%29">semaphores</a>, <a href="Barrier%20%28computer%20science%29">barriers</a> or some other <a href="Synchronization%20%28computer%20science%29">synchronization method</a>.

Subtasks in a parallel program are often called <a href="Thread%20%28computing%29">threads</a>. Some parallel computer architectures use smaller, lightweight versions of threads known as <a href="Fiber%20%28computer%20science%29">fibers</a>, while others use bigger versions known as <a href="Process%20%28computing%29">processes</a>. However, "threads" is generally accepted as a generic term for subtasks. Threads will often need <a href="Synchronization%20%28computer%20science%29">synchronized</a> access to an <a href="Object%20%28computer%20science%29">object</a> or other <a href="Resource%20management%20%28computing%29">resource</a>, for example when they must update a <a href="Variable%20%28programming%29">variable</a> that is shared between them. Without synchronization, the instructions between the two threads may be interleaved in any order. For example, consider the following program:

If instruction 1B is executed between 1A and 3A, or if instruction 1A is executed between 1B and 3B, the program will produce incorrect data. This is known as a <a href="race%20condition">race condition</a>. The programmer must use a <a href="Lock%20%28computer%20science%29">lock</a> to provide <a href="mutual%20exclusion">mutual exclusion</a>. A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is free to execute its <a href="critical%20section">critical section</a> (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be rewritten to use locks:

One thread will successfully lock variable V, while the other thread will be <a href="Software%20lockout">locked out</a>—unable to proceed until V is unlocked again. This guarantees correct execution of the program. Locks may be necessary to ensure correct program execution when threads must serialize access to resources, but their use can greatly slow a program and may affect its <a href="Software%20quality%23Reliability">reliability</a>.

Locking multiple variables using <a href="Atomic%20operation">non-atomic</a> locks introduces the possibility of program <a href="deadlock">deadlock</a>. An <a href="atomic%20lock">atomic lock</a> locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, it is possible that one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.

Many parallel programs require that their subtasks <a href="Synchronization%20%28computer%20science%29">act in synchrony</a>. This requires the use of a <a href="barrier%20%28computer%20science%29">barrier</a>. Barriers are typically implemented using a lock or a <a href="Semaphore%20%28programming%29">semaphore</a>. One class of algorithms, known as <a href="lock-free%20and%20wait-free%20algorithms">lock-free and wait-free algorithms</a>, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.

Not all parallelization results in speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into more and more threads, those threads spend an ever-increasing portion of their time communicating with each other or waiting on each other for access to resources. Once the overhead from resource contention or communication dominates the time spent on other computation, further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases the amount of time required to finish. This problem, known as <a href="parallel%20slowdown">parallel slowdown</a>, can be improved in some cases by software analysis and redesign.

Applications are often classified according to how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism if they do not communicate many times per second, and it exhibits <a href="Embarrassingly%20parallel">embarrassing parallelism</a> if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.

Parallel programming languages and parallel computers must have a <a href="consistency%20model">consistency model</a> (also known as a memory model). The consistency model defines rules for how operations on <a href="Computer%20data%20storage">computer memory</a> occur and how results are produced.

One of the first consistency models was <a href="Leslie%20Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a>'s <a href="sequential%20consistency">sequential consistency</a> model. Sequential consistency is the property of a parallel program that its parallel execution produces the same results as a sequential program. Specifically, a program is sequentially consistent if "the results of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program".

<a href="Software%20transactional%20memory">Software transactional memory</a> is a common type of consistency model. Software transactional memory borrows from <a href="Database%20management%20system">database theory</a> the concept of <a href="Atomic%20commit">atomic transactions</a> and applies them to memory accesses.

Mathematically, these models can be represented in several ways. Introduced in 1962, <a href="Petri%20net">Petri net</a>s were an early attempt to codify the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and <a href="Dataflow%20architecture">Dataflow architecture</a>s were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, <a href="process%20calculi">process calculi</a> such as <a href="Calculus%20of%20Communicating%20Systems">Calculus of Communicating Systems</a> and <a href="Communicating%20Sequential%20Processes">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> were developed to permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the <a href="pi%20calculus">π-calculus</a>, have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's <a href="Temporal%20logic%20of%20actions">TLA+</a>, and mathematical models such as <a href="Trace%20theory">traces</a> and <a href="Actor%20model%20theory">Actor event diagrams</a>, have also been developed to describe the behavior of concurrent systems.

<a href="Michael%20J.%20Flynn">Michael J. Flynn</a> created one of the earliest classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as <a href="Flynn%27s%20taxonomy">Flynn's taxonomy</a>. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using a single set or multiple sets of instructions, and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or multiple sets of data.

The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) classification is equivalent to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a> applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures to deal with this were devised (such as <a href="systolic%20array">systolic array</a>s), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far the most common type of parallel programs.

According to <a href="David%20A.%20Patterson%20%28scientist%29">David A. Patterson</a> and <a href="John%20L.%20Hennessy">John L. Hennessy</a>, "Some machines are hybrids of these categories, of course, but this classic model has survived because it is simple, easy to understand, and gives a good first approximation. It is also—perhaps because of its understandability—the most widely used scheme."

From the advent of <a href="very-large-scale%20integration">very-large-scale integration</a> (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">computer word size</a>—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. For example, where an <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> processor must add two <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> <a href="integer">integer</a>s, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the <a href="carry%20bit">carry bit</a> from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.

Historically, <a href="4-bit">4-bit</a> microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors. This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until the early 2000s, with the advent of <a href="x86-64">x86-64</a> architectures, did <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a> processors become commonplace.

A computer program is, in essence, a stream of instructions executed by a processor. Without instruction-level parallelism, a processor can only issue less than one <a href="Instructions%20per%20cycle">instruction per clock cycle</a> (). These processors are known as "subscalar" processors. These instructions can be <a href="Out-of-order%20execution">re-ordered</a> and combined into groups which are then executed in parallel without changing the result of the program. This is known as instruction-level parallelism. Advances in instruction-level parallelism dominated computer architecture from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s.

All modern processors have multi-stage <a href="Instruction%20pipelining">instruction pipelines</a>. Each stage in the pipeline corresponds to a different action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an "N"-stage pipeline can have up to "N" different instructions at different stages of completion and thus can issue one instruction per clock cycle (). These processors are known as "scalar" processors. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a <a href="Reduced%20Instruction%20Set%20Computer">RISC</a> processor, with five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and register write back (WB). The <a href="Pentium%204">Pentium 4</a> processor had a 35-stage pipeline.

Most modern processors also have multiple <a href="execution%20unit">execution unit</a>s. They usually combine this feature with pipelining and thus can issue more than one instruction per clock cycle (). These processors are known as "<a href="superscalar">superscalar</a>" processors. Instructions can be grouped together only if there is no <a href="data%20dependency">data dependency</a> between them. <a href="Scoreboarding">Scoreboarding</a> and the <a href="Tomasulo%20algorithm">Tomasulo algorithm</a> (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of <a href="register%20renaming">register renaming</a>) are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism.

Task parallelisms is the characteristic of a parallel program that "entirely different calculations can be performed on either the same or different sets of data". This contrasts with data parallelism, where the same calculation is performed on the same or different sets of data. Task parallelism involves the decomposition of a task into sub-tasks and then allocating each sub-task to a processor for execution. The processors would then execute these sub-tasks concurrently and often cooperatively. Task parallelism does not usually scale with the size of a problem.

Main memory in a parallel computer is either <a href="Shared%20memory%20%28interprocess%20communication%29">shared memory</a> (shared between all processing elements in a single <a href="address%20space">address space</a>), or <a href="distributed%20memory">distributed memory</a> (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. <a href="Distributed%20shared%20memory">Distributed shared memory</a> and <a href="memory%20virtualization">memory virtualization</a> combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.

Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal <a href="Memory%20latency">latency</a> and <a href="Bandwidth%20%28computing%29">bandwidth</a> are known as <a href="uniform%20memory%20access">uniform memory access</a> (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a <a href="Shared%20memory%20%28interprocess%20communication%29">shared memory</a> system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a <a href="non-uniform%20memory%20access">non-uniform memory access</a> (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.

Computer systems make use of <a href="CPU%20cache">cache</a>s—small and fast memories located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value in more than one location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a <a href="cache%20coherency">cache coherency</a> system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. <a href="Bus%20sniffing">Bus snooping</a> is one of the most common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.

Processor–processor and processor–memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or <a href="Multiplexing">multiplexed</a>) memory, a <a href="crossbar%20switch">crossbar switch</a>, a shared <a href="Bus%20%28computing%29">bus</a> or an interconnect network of a myriad of <a href="Network%20topology">topologies</a> including <a href="Star%20network">star</a>, <a href="Ring%20network">ring</a>, <a href="Tree%20%28graph%20theory%29">tree</a>, <a href="Hypercube%20graph">hypercube</a>, fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor at a node), or <a href="Mesh%20networking">n-dimensional mesh</a>.

Parallel computers based on interconnected networks need to have some kind of <a href="routing">routing</a> to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines.

Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.

A multi-core processor is a processor that includes multiple <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">processing units</a> (called "cores") on the same chip. This processor differs from a <a href="superscalar">superscalar</a> processor, which includes multiple <a href="execution%20unit">execution unit</a>s and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from one instruction stream (thread); in contrast, a multi-core processor can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple instruction streams. <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="Cell%20%28microprocessor%29">Cell microprocessor</a>, designed for use in the <a href="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, is a prominent multi-core processor. Each core in a multi-core processor can potentially be superscalar as well—that is, on every clock cycle, each core can issue multiple instructions from one thread.

<a href="Instruction%20pipelining">Instruction pipelining</a> (of which Intel's <a href="Hyper-Threading">Hyper-Threading</a> is the best known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of concurrent multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from "multiple" threads. <a href="Temporal%20multithreading">Temporal multithreading</a> on the other hand includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from "multiple" threads.

A symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) is a computer system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. <a href="Bus%20contention">Bus contention</a> prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32 processors. Because of the small size of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.

A distributed computer (also known as a distributed memory multiprocessor) is a distributed memory computer system in which the processing elements are connected by a network. Distributed computers are highly scalable. The terms "<a href="concurrent%20computing">concurrent computing</a>", "parallel computing", and "distributed computing" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them. The same system may be characterized both as "parallel" and "distributed"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.

A cluster is a group of loosely coupled computers that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster do not have to be symmetric, <a href="Load%20balancing%20%28computing%29">load balancing</a> is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the <a href="Beowulf%20%28computing%29">Beowulf cluster</a>, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical <a href="commercial%20off-the-shelf">commercial off-the-shelf</a> computers connected with a <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a>. Beowulf technology was originally developed by <a href="Thomas%20Sterling%20%28computing%29">Thomas Sterling</a> and <a href="Donald%20Becker">Donald Becker</a>. 87% of all <a href="TOP500">Top500</a> supercomputers are clusters. The remaining are Massively Parallel Processors, explained below.

Because grid computing systems (described below) can easily handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically designed to handle more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-<a href="latency%20%28engineering%29">latency</a> interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often <a href="Myrinet">Myrinet</a>, <a href="InfiniBand">InfiniBand</a>, or <a href="Gigabit%20Ethernet">Gigabit Ethernet</a>.

A massively parallel processor (MPP) is a single computer with many networked processors. MPPs have many of the same characteristics as clusters, but MPPs have specialized interconnect networks (whereas clusters use commodity hardware for networking). MPPs also tend to be larger than clusters, typically having "far more" than 100 processors. In an MPP, "each CPU contains its own memory and copy of the operating system and application. Each subsystem communicates with the others via a high-speed interconnect."

<a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="Blue%20Gene">Blue Gene/L</a>, the fifth fastest <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a> in the world according to the June 2009 <a href="TOP500">TOP500</a> ranking, is an MPP.

Grid computing is the most distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> to work on a given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with <a href="embarrassingly%20parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> problems. <a href="List%20of%20distributed%20computing%20projects">Many distributed computing applications</a> have been created, of which <a href="SETI%40home">SETI@home</a> and <a href="Folding%40home">Folding@home</a> are the best-known examples.

Most grid computing applications use <a href="middleware">middleware</a> (software that sits between the operating system and the application to manage network resources and standardize the software interface). The most common distributed computing middleware is the <a href="Berkeley%20Open%20Infrastructure%20for%20Network%20Computing">Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing</a> (BOINC). Often, distributed computing software makes use of "spare cycles", performing computations at times when a computer is idling.

Within parallel computing, there are specialized parallel devices that remain niche areas of interest. While not <a href="Domain-specific%20programming%20language">domain-specific</a>, they tend to be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.

<a href="Reconfigurable%20computing">Reconfigurable computing</a> is the use of a <a href="field-programmable%20gate%20array">field-programmable gate array</a> (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.

FPGAs can be programmed with <a href="hardware%20description%20language">hardware description language</a>s such as <a href="VHDL">VHDL</a> or <a href="Verilog">Verilog</a>. However, programming in these languages can be tedious. Several vendors have created <a href="C%20to%20HDL">C to HDL</a> languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and semantics of the <a href="C%20programming%20language">C programming language</a>, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are <a href="Mitrionics">Mitrion-C</a>, <a href="Impulse%20C">Impulse C</a>, <a href="DIME-C">DIME-C</a>, and <a href="Handel-C">Handel-C</a>. Specific subsets of <a href="SystemC">SystemC</a> based on C++ can also be used for this purpose.

AMD's decision to open its <a href="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a> technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for high-performance reconfigurable computing. According to Michael R. D'Amour, Chief Operating Officer of <a href="DRC%20Computer%20Corporation">DRC Computer Corporation</a>, "when we first walked into AMD, they called us 'the <a href="CPU%20socket">socket</a> stealers.' Now they call us their partners."

General-purpose computing on <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a>s (GPGPU) is a fairly recent trend in computer engineering research. GPUs are co-processors that have been heavily optimized for <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a> processing. Computer graphics processing is a field dominated by data parallel operations—particularly <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a> <a href="Matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> operations.

In the early days, GPGPU programs used the normal graphics APIs for executing programs. However, several new programming languages and platforms have been built to do general purpose computation on GPUs with both <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> and <a href="AMD">AMD</a> releasing programming environments with <a href="CUDA">CUDA</a> and <a href="AMD%20FireStream%23Software%20Development%20Kit">Stream SDK</a> respectively. Other GPU programming languages include <a href="BrookGPU">BrookGPU</a>, <a href="PeakStream">PeakStream</a>, and <a href="RapidMind">RapidMind</a>. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their <a href="Nvidia%20Tesla">Tesla series</a>. The technology consortium Khronos Group has released the <a href="OpenCL">OpenCL</a> specification, which is a framework for writing programs that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs. <a href="AMD">AMD</a>, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>, <a href="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> and others are supporting <a href="OpenCL">OpenCL</a>.

Several <a href="application-specific%20integrated%20circuit">application-specific integrated circuit</a> (ASIC) approaches have been devised for dealing with parallel applications.

Because an ASIC is (by definition) specific to a given application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by <a href="photolithography">UV photolithography</a>. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by <a href="Moore%27s%20law">Moore's law</a>) tend to wipe out these gains in only one or two chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS <a href="RIKEN%20MDGRAPE-3">RIKEN MDGRAPE-3</a> machine which uses custom ASICs for <a href="molecular%20dynamics">molecular dynamics</a> simulation.

A vector processor is a CPU or computer system that can execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is "A" = "B" × "C", where "A", "B", and "C" are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit <a href="floating-point">floating-point</a> numbers. They are closely related to Flynn's SIMD classification.

<a href="Cray">Cray</a> computers became famous for their vector-processing computers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, vector processors—both as CPUs and as full computer systems—have generally disappeared. Modern <a href="Instruction%20set">processor instruction sets</a> do include some vector processing instructions, such as with <a href="Freescale%20Semiconductor">Freescale Semiconductor</a>'s <a href="AltiVec">AltiVec</a> and <a href="Intel">Intel</a>'s <a href="Streaming%20SIMD%20Extensions">Streaming SIMD Extensions</a> (SSE).

<a href="List%20of%20concurrent%20and%20parallel%20programming%20languages">Concurrent programming languages</a>, <a href="Library%20%28computing%29">libraries</a>, <a href="Application%20programming%20interface">APIs</a>, and <a href="parallel%20programming%20model">parallel programming model</a>s (such as <a href="algorithmic%20skeleton">algorithmic skeleton</a>s) have been created for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses <a href="message%20passing">message passing</a>. <a href="POSIX%20Threads">POSIX Threads</a> and <a href="OpenMP">OpenMP</a> are two of the most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas <a href="Message%20Passing%20Interface">Message Passing Interface</a> (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the <a href="Futures%20and%20promises">future concept</a>, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.

<a href="CAPS%20entreprise">CAPS entreprise</a> and <a href="Pathscale">Pathscale</a> are also coordinating their effort to make <a href="hybrid%20multi-core%20parallel%20programming">hybrid multi-core parallel programming</a> (HMPP) directives an open standard called <a href="OpenHMPP">OpenHMPP</a>. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory. OpenHMPP directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> or <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a> codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the accelerator memory.

The rise of consumer GPUs has led to support for <a href="compute%20kernel">compute kernel</a>s, either in graphics APIs (referred to as <a href="compute%20shader">compute shader</a>s), in dedicated APIs (such as <a href="OpenCL">OpenCL</a>), or in other language extensions.

Automatic parallelization of a sequential program by a <a href="compiler">compiler</a> is the "holy grail" of parallel computing, especially with the aforementioned limit of processor frequency. Despite decades of work by compiler researchers, automatic parallelization has had only limited success.

Mainstream parallel programming languages remain either <a href="Explicit%20parallelism">explicitly parallel</a> or (at best) <a href="Implicit%20parallelism">partially implicit</a>, in which a programmer gives the compiler <a href="Directive%20%28programming%29">directives</a> for parallelization. A few fully implicit parallel programming languages exist—<a href="SISAL">SISAL</a>, Parallel <a href="Haskell%20%28programming%20language%29">Haskell</a>, <a href="SequenceL">SequenceL</a>, <a href="System%20C">System C</a> (for <a href="FPGA">FPGA</a>s), <a href="Mitrion-C">Mitrion-C</a>, <a href="VHDL">VHDL</a>, and <a href="Verilog">Verilog</a>.

As a computer system grows in complexity, the <a href="mean%20time%20between%20failures">mean time between failures</a> usually decreases. <a href="Application%20checkpointing">Application checkpointing</a> is a technique whereby the computer system takes a "snapshot" of the application—a record of all current resource allocations and variable states, akin to a <a href="core%20dump">core dump</a>—; this information can be used to restore the program if the computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in <a href="high%20performance%20computing">high performance computing</a>.

As parallel computers become larger and faster, we are now able to solve problems that had previously taken too long to run. Fields as varied as <a href="bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a> (for <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a> and <a href="sequence%20analysis">sequence analysis</a>) and economics (for <a href="mathematical%20finance">mathematical finance</a>) have taken advantage of parallel computing. Common types of problems in parallel computing applications include:


Parallel computing can also be applied to the design of <a href="fault-tolerant%20computer%20system">fault-tolerant computer system</a>s, particularly via <a href="Lockstep%20%28computing%29">lockstep</a> systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides <a href="Redundancy%20%28engineering%29">redundancy</a> in case one component fails, and also allows automatic <a href="error%20detection">error detection</a> and <a href="error%20correction">error correction</a> if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single-event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.

The origins of true (MIMD) parallelism go back to <a href="Luigi%20Federico%20Menabrea">Luigi Federico Menabrea</a> and his "Sketch of the <a href="Analytic%20Engine">Analytic Engine</a> Invented by <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>".

In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) discussed parallel programming and the need for branching and waiting. Also in 1958, IBM researchers <a href="John%20Cocke">John Cocke</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Slotnick">Daniel Slotnick</a> discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. <a href="Burroughs%20Corporation">Burroughs Corporation</a> introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a <a href="crossbar%20switch">crossbar switch</a>. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that <a href="Amdahl%27s%20law">Amdahl's law</a> was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.

In 1969, <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> introduced its first <a href="Multics">Multics</a> system, a symmetric multiprocessor system capable of running up to eight processors in parallel. <a href="C.mmp">C.mmp</a>, a multi-processor project at <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in the 1970s, was among the first multiprocessors with more than a few processors. The first bus-connected multiprocessor with snooping caches was the <a href="Synapse%20N%2B1">Synapse N+1</a> in 1984.

SIMD parallel computers can be traced back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize the <a href="Propagation%20delay">gate delay</a> of the processor's <a href="control%20unit">control unit</a> over multiple instructions. In 1964, Slotnick had proposed building a massively parallel computer for the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>. His design was funded by the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a>, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, <a href="ILLIAC%20IV">ILLIAC IV</a>. The key to its design was a fairly high parallelism, with up to 256 processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would later be known as <a href="vector%20processor">vector processing</a>. However, ILLIAC IV was called "the most infamous of supercomputers", because the project was only one-fourth completed, but took 11 years and cost almost four times the original estimate. When it was finally ready to run its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the <a href="Cray-1">Cray-1</a>.

In the early 1970s, at the <a href="MIT%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Laboratory">MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> and <a href="Seymour%20Papert">Seymour Papert</a> started developing the "<a href="Society%20of%20Mind">Society of Mind</a>" theory, which views the biological brain as <a href="Massively%20parallel">massively parallel computer</a>. In 1986, Minsky published "The Society of Mind", which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.

Similar models (which also view biological brain as massively parallel computer, i.e., the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by:

Æthelred of Mercia

Æthelred (; died after 704) was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Mercia">King of Mercia</a> from 675 until 704. He was the son of <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a> and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, <a href="Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia">Wulfhere of Mercia</a>, died. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a>. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith of Northumbria</a>, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Northumbrians</a>, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. It also permanently returned the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Lindsey">kingdom of Lindsey</a> to Mercia's possession. However, Æthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain.

He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> in Mercia and Northumbria. Æthelred befriended Bishop <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; Æthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the <a href="Middle%20Angles">Middle Angles</a> during his exile and supported him at the <a href="Council%20of%20Austerfield">synod of Austerfield</a> in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria.

Æthelred's wife, <a href="Osthryth">Osthryth</a>, was a daughter of King <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu</a>, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 Æthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son <a href="Coenred%20of%20Mercia">Coenred</a>. Æthelred became a monk at <a href="Bardney">Bardney</a>, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was Æthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that Æthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

By the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> who had come to Britain two hundred years before. The kingdom of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> occupied what is now the English midlands. The origin of the kingdom is not recorded, but royal genealogies preserved in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" and the <a href="Anglian%20collection">Anglian collection</a> agree that the royal houses were descended from a founder named <a href="Icel%20%28person%29">Icel</a>; the Mercian royal house is hence known as the Iclingas. The earliest Mercian king about whom definite historical information has survived is <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a>, Æthelred's father. The larger neighbouring kingdoms included <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Northumbria</a> to the north, recently united from its constituent kingdoms of <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a> and <a href="Deira%20%28kingdom%29">Deira</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> to the east, and <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south.

According to "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", a history of the English church written by the 8th-century monk <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, there were seven early Anglo-Saxon rulers who held "imperium", or overlordship, over the other kingdoms. The fifth of these was <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>, who was killed at the <a href="battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">battle of Hatfield Chase</a> by a combined force including <a href="Cadwallon%20ap%20Cadfan">Cadwallon</a>, a British king of <a href="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>, and Penda. After Edwin's death, Northumbria briefly fell apart into its two subkingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Within a year <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>, Edwin's nephew, killed Cadwallon and reunited the kingdoms, subsequently re-establishing Northumbrian hegemony over the south of England. In 642 Penda killed Oswald at the <a href="battle%20of%20Maserfield">battle of Maserfield</a>, and Northumbria was again divided. Oswald's son <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu</a> succeeded to the throne of Bernicia, and <a href="Osric%20of%20Deira">Osric's</a> son <a href="Oswine%20of%20Deira">Oswine</a> to Deira, the southern of the two kingdoms.

In 655, Oswiu defeated and killed Penda at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Winwaed">Battle of the Winwaed</a>. Oswiu installed <a href="Peada%20of%20Mercia">Peada</a>, a son of Penda, as king of southern Mercia and ruled the northern half himself; after Peada was murdered in 656 Oswiu took direct control of all of Mercia. A coup in 658 threw off Northumbrian overlordship and established Wulfhere as king. By the early 670s, Wulfhere had become the most powerful king in southern Britain, with an effective hegemony over all the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Northumbria.

The main source for this period is Bede's "History", completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work also provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. For Wessex and Kent, Bede had informants who supplied him with details of the church's history in each province, but he appears to have had no such contact in Mercia, about which he is less well-informed. A further source for this period is the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", compiled at the end of the 9th century in Wessex. The "Chronicle"s anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods.

Æthelred was the son of Penda of Mercia. Penda's queen, Cynewise, is named by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not certain that she was Æthelred's mother. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" gives Penda's age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty years old at the time of his death, which is generally thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) were young when he was killed. At least as likely is that Penda was fifty years old at his death, rather than at his accession. Æthelred's date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes Wulfhere as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he and Æthelred were in their middle teens at that time. The early sources do not say whether Æthelred was older or younger than Wulfhere.

Nothing is known of Æthelred's childhood. He had another brother, Peada, and two sisters, <a href="Kyneburga%2C%20Kyneswide%20and%20Tibba">Cyneburh and Cyneswith</a>; it is also possible that <a href="Merewalh">Merewalh</a>, king of the <a href="Magons%C3%A6te">Magonsæte</a>, was Æthelred's brother.

In 674, according to <a href="Stephen%20of%20Ripon">Stephen of Ripon</a>, Wulfhere "stirred up all the southern nations against [Northumbria]", but he was defeated by Oswiu's son <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a> who forced him to surrender Lindsey, and to pay tribute. Wulfhere survived the defeat, but died in 675, possibly of disease, and Æthelred became king.

The first recorded act of Æthelred's reign is in 676, when his armies ravaged Kent, destroying Rochester, the seat of the bishops of West Kent. The reason for his attack is not recorded, but he may have wished to prevent King <a href="Hlothhere%20of%20Kent">Hlothhere of Kent</a> from regaining control of Surrey, which had been recently brought into the Mercian orbit by Wulfhere. It may also be that Æthelred wished for revenge for the murder of the sons of <a href="Eormenred%20of%20Kent">Eormenred of Kent</a>; the murders had been instigated by <a href="Ecgberht%20of%20Kent">Ecgberht of Kent</a>, Hlothhere's brother, and it is possible that Æthelred was the uncle of the murdered princes. A third suggestion is that the kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Essex</a> solicited the invasion, in response to recent Kentish attempts to gain dominance over the East Saxons. Regardless of the reason, Hlothhere was likely then forced to accept Æthelred's overlordship. The damage to the see of Rochester was so great that the incumbent bishop, <a href="Putta%20%28bishop%20of%20Hereford%29">Putta</a>, retired from his diocese; his appointed successor, <a href="Cwichhelm%20%28bishop%29">Cwichhelm</a>, also gave up the see "because of its poverty".

Early in Æthelred's reign, <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, began a substantial reorganization of the church in Mercia. In 675 he removed <a href="Winfred%20%28bishop%29">Winfred</a> from his position as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lichfield">Bishop of Lichfield</a>, and over the next four years he divided the vast Mercian see into the five dioceses of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Leicester">Leicester</a>, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">Worcester</a>, <a href="Mercian%20Diocese%20of%20Dorchester">Dorchester</a> and <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Hereford</a>. Æthelred was a devout king, "more famed for his pious disposition than his skill in war", and he made several gifts of land to the expanding church, including grants at <a href="Tetbury">Tetbury</a>, <a href="Long%20Newnton">Long Newnton</a>, and <a href="Somerford%20Keynes">Somerford Keynes</a>. There is also a tradition that Æthelred was associated with the founding of <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abingdon Abbey</a>, in southern <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>.

Mercia had been in conflict with Northumbria since at least 633, when Penda of Mercia defeated and killed Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. However, there were diplomatic marriages between the two kingdoms: Æthelred's sister Cyneburh married <a href="Alhfrith%20of%20Deira">Alhfrith</a>, a son of Oswiu of Northumbria, and both Æthelred and his brother Peada married daughters of Oswiu. Cyneburh's marriage to Alhfrith took place in the early 650s, and Peada's marriage, to Ealhflæd, followed shortly afterwards; Æthelred's marriage, to <a href="Osthryth">Osthryth</a>, is of unknown date but must have occurred before 679, since Bede mentions it in describing the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Trent">Battle of the Trent</a>, which took place that year.

Bede does not mention the cause of the battle, simply saying that it occurred in the ninth year of Ecgfrith's reign. He is more informative on the outcome. <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Deira">Ælfwine</a>, the young subking of Deira, was killed; Ælfwine was brother to Osthryth and Ecgfrith, and was well liked in both Mercia and Northumbria since Æthelred's marriage to Osthryth. According to Bede, his death threatened to cause further strife between the two kingdoms, but Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened:Theodore, the beloved of God, enlisting God's help, smothered the flames of this awful peril by his wholesome advice. As a result, peace was restored between the kings and peoples, and in lieu of further bloodshed the customary compensation was paid to King Ecgfrith for his brother's death.

Æthelred took possession of Lindsey again after the battle; the change in control this time was lasting, and Lindsey remained part of Mercia until the Viking invasion of the 9th century remade the map of England. Conflict between Northumbria and Mercia did not completely cease after this date: Scottish annals record that <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Mercia">Æthelbald</a>, an 8th-century Mercian king, ravaged Northumbrian territory in 740 while King <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Northumbria">Eadberht of Northumbria</a> was absent fighting the <a href="Picts">Picts</a>. However, the Battle of the Trent effectively ended Northumbrian involvement in southern Britain.

A conflict between Bishop <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> of York and the church and secular establishment led to Wilfrid's expulsion from Northumbria and the division of his vast diocese, and Æthelred sided with Ecgfrith against Wilfrid. After Ecgfrith's death in 685, Archbishop Theodore arranged a reconciliation between Wilfrid and <a href="Aldfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Aldfrith</a>, Ecgfrith's successor, but in 692 Aldfrith and Wilfrid fell out and Wilfrid went into exile in Mercia. Æthelred now supported Wilfrid, making him bishop of the <a href="Middle%20Angles">Middle Angles</a>, and defending him at the <a href="Council%20of%20Austerfield">Council of Austerfield</a> in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case before an assembly of bishops led by Archbishop <a href="Berhtwald">Berhtwald</a> of Canterbury. Æthelred's support for Wilfrid embroiled him in dispute with both Canterbury and Northumbria, and it is not clear what his motive was, though it may be relevant that some of Wilfrid's monasteries were in Mercian territory.

Two charters of 681 show Æthelred granting land near Tetbury, on what is now the border between <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> and <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. This may indicate that Æthelred was able to extend Mercian influence further into the territory of the West Saxons, as Wulfhere had done before him. The West Saxons managed a significant military resurgence under <a href="C%C3%A6dwalla%20of%20Wessex">Cædwalla</a>, king of Wessex from about 685 to 688, but when Cædwalla departed for Rome on pilgrimage there may have been internal strife before <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a>, his successor, took the throne. Cædwalla had successfully conquered the kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sussex">Sussex</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>, and his abdication may have contributed to the unsettled history of the southeast over the next few years. In Kent, <a href="Oswine%20of%20Kent">Oswine</a> emerged as king, though only in eastern Kent; the western half of the kingdom was ruled by <a href="Sw%C3%A6fheard">Swæfheard</a>, son of <a href="S%C3%A6bbi%20of%20Essex">Sæbbi</a>, the king of Essex. It is possible that Æthelred provided support to both Swæfheard and Oswine; for each king a charter survives in which Æthelred confirms land grants they made in Kent, and Æthelred's invasion of Kent in 676 indicates his opposition to the traditional Kentish royal house. A charter of Swæfheard's dated 691 is also of interest as it indicates that Æthelred had invaded Kent; it has been suggested that Æthelred intended to place Wilfrid in the Archbishop's seat at Canterbury, but if so he was unsuccessful. Alternatively, Æthelred may have needed assistance in Kent from the East Saxons who may have been independent of Mercia for a decade or more by that time. The East Saxons did return to the Mercian orbit over the next few years: a charter of Æthelred's, dated between 693 and 704, shows him granting land to Wealdhere, the bishop of London, and in 704 Æthelred consented to a grant made by Swæfheard. The latter charter also appears to show that a "comes", or local official, was put in place by the Mercians to protect their interests.

Despite this evidence of Mercian involvement in the southeast there is very little indication that Æthelred had expansionist ambitions to the south. The increasing strength of the West Saxons under Cædwalla and Ine would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction. The Northumbrians were no longer a distraction; they had been contained north of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a> since the Battle of the Trent, and became even less of a threat after their disastrous defeat in 685 at the hands of the Picts. A possible explanation is that Æthelred was preoccupied with war with the Welsh. It was also at this time that the <a href="Hwicce">Hwicce</a> came more definitely into the Mercian orbit. The last Hwiccean ruler to take the title of king was <a href="Oshere">Oshere</a>, who died in 685; but from the mid-670s he sought Æthelred's consent for his grants, and Æthelred regarded him as a subking. Further evidence of Æthelred's involvement among the Hwicce comes from a charter in which he grants land for a <a href="Minster%20%28church%29">minster</a> in Gloucestershire, in Hwiccean territory; the charter is generally thought to be a fabrication, but it appears to be based on an authentic earlier source.

Osthryth was murdered in 697, for reasons unknown; according to Bede the murderers were "her own people, the Mercian chieftains". Bede records that Peada's death, forty years earlier, stemmed from "the treachery, it is said, of his own wife"; Peada's wife was Ealhflæd, Osthryth's sister. Hence Osthryth's murder may have been in revenge for Peada's assassination, though it has also been interpreted more directly as a sign of continuing hostility between Northumbria and Mercia. Osthryth was buried at <a href="Bardney%20Abbey">Bardney</a> in Lindsey, the monastery where, at her urging, the relics of her uncle, Oswald of Northumbria, were kept and revered, though evidence of resistance at Bardney to the cult of Oswald is also indicative of the poor relations between the two kingdoms.

In 704, Æthelred abdicated to become a monk and abbot at Bardney, leaving the kingship to his nephew <a href="Coenred%20of%20Mercia">Coenred</a>. Seventh century Mercian rulers often patronised religious establishments outside the Mercian heartlands, perhaps as a way of gaining support in outlying provinces. Æthelred's and Osthryth's interest in Bardney is consistent with this pattern. The encouragement of the cult of royal saints in areas beyond the central Mercian lands also seems to have been a deliberate policy, and both Æthelred and Osthryth were later revered as saints at Bardney. It appears that Æthelred continued to have influence in the kingdom after his abdication: a passage in Stephen of Ripon's "<a href="Vita%20Sancti%20Wilfrithi">Life of Wilfrid</a>" shows Æthelred summoning Coenred to him and advising him to make peace with Wilfrid. The date of Æthelred's death is not recorded; though it is known that he was buried at Bardney.

Æthelred had at least one son, <a href="Ceolred%20of%20Mercia">Ceolred</a>. According to the thirteenth-century "<a href="Chronicon%20Abbatiae%20de%20Evesham">Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham</a>", Ceolred was not the son of Osthryth, although it does not name Ceolred's mother, and in the view of the historian <a href="Ann%20Williams%20%28historian%29">Ann Williams</a> this may mean that Æthelred remarried after Osthryth's death. However, Susan Kelly states that Osthryth was "most likely (though not certainly)" Ceolred's mother. Ceolred succeeded to the throne in 709, after Coenred abdicated in 709 to go to Rome on pilgrimage. One version of the regnal lists for Mercia shows a king named <a href="Ceolwald%20of%20Mercia">Ceolwald</a> reigning after Ceolred, and it is possible that Ceolwald, if he existed, was also a son of Æthelred's.

Penda of Mercia

Penda (died 15 November 655) was a 7th-century <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Mercia">King</a> of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, the <a href="Heptarchy">Anglo-Saxon kingdom</a> in what is today the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a>. A <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20polytheism">pagan</a> at a time when <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> was taking hold in many of the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdoms, Penda took over the <a href="Severn%20Valley%20%28England%29">Severn Valley</a> in 628 following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cirencester">Battle of Cirencester</a> before participating in the defeat of the powerful <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n <a href="monarch">king</a> <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">Battle of Hatfield Chase</a> in 633.

Nine years later, he defeated and killed Edwin's eventual successor, <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Maserfield">Battle of Maserfield</a>; from this point he was probably the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the <a href="Mercian%20Supremacy">Mercian supremacy</a> over the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Heptarchy">Heptarchy</a>. He repeatedly defeated the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20East%20Angles">East Angles</a> and drove <a href="Cenwalh">Cenwalh</a> the king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a>ns of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor and brother <a href="Oswiu">Oswiu</a>, and was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Winwaed">Battle of the Winwaed</a> in the course of a final campaign against the Bernicians.

The etymology of the name Penda is unknown. Penda of Mercia is the only monarch with this name, but a number of Mercian commoners with the same name are on record.

Suggestions for etymologies of the name are essentially divided between a Celtic and a Germanic origin.
The names of members of a Northumbrian [spiritual] brotherhood are recorded in the ninth century "Liber vitae Dunelmensis," the name Penda occurs in this list and is categorised as a British (Welsh) name. <a href="John%20T.%20Koch">John T. Koch</a> noted that, "Penda and a number of other royal names from early Anglian Mercia have more obvious <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Brythonic</a> than German explanations, though they do not correspond to known Welsh names." These royal names include those of Penda's father Pybba, and of his son Peada. It has been suggested that the firm alliance between Penda and various British princes might be the result of a "racial cause."

Continental Germanic comparanda for the name include a feminine "Penta" (9th century) and a toponym "Penti-lingen", suggesting an underlying personal name "Pendi".

Penda was a son of <a href="Pybba%20of%20Mercia">Pybba of Mercia</a> and said to be an <a href="Iclingas">Icling</a>, with a lineage purportedly extending back to <a href="W%C5%8Dden">Wōden</a>. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" gives his descent as follows:

Penda was Pybba's offspring, Pybba was <a href="Creoda%20of%20Mercia">Cryda</a>'s offspring, Cryda Cynewald's offspring, Cynewald Cnebba's offspring, Cnebba Icel's offspring, Icel Eomer's offspring, Eomer <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Angles%23Angeltheow">Angeltheow</a>'s offspring, Angeltheow <a href="Offa%20of%20Angel">Offa</a>'s offspring, Offa <a href="Wermund">Wermund</a>'s offspring, Wermund <a href="Wihtl%C3%A6g">Wihtlæg</a>'s offspring, Wihtlæg Woden's offspring.

The "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>" says that Pybba had 12 sons, including Penda, but that Penda and <a href="Eowa%20of%20Mercia">Eowa of Mercia</a> were those best known to its author. (Many of these 12 sons of Pybba may in fact merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.) Besides Eowa, the pedigrees also give Penda a brother named Coenwalh from whom two later kings were said to descend, although this may instead represent his brother-in-law <a href="Cenwalh%20of%20Wessex">Cenwalh of Wessex</a>.

The time at which Penda became king is uncertain, as are the circumstances. Another Mercian king, <a href="Cearl%20of%20Mercia">Cearl</a>, is mentioned by <a href="Bede">Bede</a> as ruling at the same time as the Northumbrian king <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelfrith</a>, in the early part of the 7th century. Whether Penda immediately succeeded Cearl is unknown, and it is also unclear whether they were related, and if so how closely; <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, writing in the 12th century, claimed that Cearl was a kinsman of Pybba. It is also possible that Cearl and Penda were dynastic rivals.

According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 years old at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not correspond to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 years old at the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son <a href="Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia">Wulfhere</a> was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the "Chronicle" actually meant to say that Penda was 50 years old at the time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.

Bede, in his "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>", says of Penda that he was "a most warlike man of the royal race of the Mercians" and that, following Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 ("see" <a href="%23Alliance%20with%20Cadwallon%20and%20the%20Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">below</a>), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune. The noted 20th-century historian <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> was of the opinion that the language used by Bede "leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat". The "Historia Brittonum" accords Penda a reign of only ten years, perhaps dating it from the time of the Battle of Maserfield ("see" <a href="%23Maserfield">below</a>) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the "Chronicle" and the "Historia", Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n, and <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a>), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.

The question of whether or not Penda was already king during the late 620s assumes greater significance in light of the "Chronicle"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s record of a battle between Penda and the West Saxons under their kings <a href="Cynegils%20of%20Wessex">Cynegils</a> and <a href="Cwichelm%20of%20Wessex">Cwichelm</a> taking place at <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a> in 628. If he was not yet king, then his involvement in this conflict might indicate that he was fighting as an independent <a href="warlord">warlord</a> during this period—as Stenton put it, "a landless noble of the Mercian royal house fighting for his own hand." On the other hand, he might have been one of multiple rulers among the Mercians at the time, ruling only a part of their territory. The "Chronicle" says that after the battle, Penda and the West Saxons "came to an agreement."

It has been speculated that this agreement marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the <a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Britons</a> in 577, and the territory eventually became part of the subkingdom of the <a href="Hwicce">Hwicce</a>. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, it has been argued that the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century.

In the late 620s or early 630s, <a href="Cadwallon%20ap%20Cadfan">Cadwallon ap Cadfan</a>, the British (Welsh) king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>, became involved in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who is thought to have been the lesser partner in their alliance, to defeat the Northumbrians in October 633 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">Battle of Hatfield Chase</a>. Penda was probably not yet king of the Mercians, but he is thought to have become king soon afterwards, based on Bede's characterisation of his position. Edwin was killed in the battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda's hands.

One manuscript of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" says that, following the victory at Hatfield Chase, Cadwallon and Penda went on to ravage "the whole land" of the Northumbrians. Certainly Cadwallon continued the war, but the extent of Penda's further participation is uncertain. Bede says that the pagans who had slain Edwin—presumably a reference to the Mercians under Penda, although conceivably it could be a derisive misnomer meant to refer to the Christian British—burned a church and town at <a href="Campodonum">Campodonum</a>, although the time at which this occurred is uncertain. Penda might have withdrawn from the war at some point before the defeat and death of Cadwallon at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heavenfield">Battle of Heavenfield</a>, about a year after Hatfield Chase, since he was not present at this battle. Furthermore, Bede makes no mention of Penda's presence in the preceding siege and battle in which <a href="Osric%20of%20Deira">Osric of Deira</a> was defeated and killed. Penda's successful participation in the battle of Hatfield Chase would have elevated his status among the Mercians and so enabled him to become king, and he might have withdrawn from the war before Heavenfield to secure or consolidate his position in Mercia. Referring to Penda's successes against the West Saxons and the Northumbrians, <a href="D.%20P.%20Kirby">D. P. Kirby</a> writes of Penda's emergence in these years as "a Mercian leader whose military exploits far transcended those of his obscure predecessors."

<a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald of Bernicia</a> became king of Northumbria after his victory over Cadwallon at Heavenfield. Penda's status and activities during the years of Oswald's reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda's position during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald's authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. It has been suggested that Penda's strength during Oswald's reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes. Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, "he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda".

At some point during Oswald's reign, Penda had Edwin's son Eadfrith killed, "contrary to his oath". The possibility that his killing was the result of pressure from Oswald—Eadfrith being a dynastic rival of Oswald—has been suggested. Since the potential existed for Eadfrith to be put to use in Mercia's favour in Northumbrian power struggles while he was alive, it would not have been to Penda's advantage to have him killed. On the other hand, Penda might have killed Eadfrith for his own reasons. It has been suggested that Penda was concerned that Eadfrith could be a threat to him because Eadfrith might seek vengeance for the deaths of his father and brother; it is also possible that Mercian dynastic rivalry played a part in the killing, since Eadfrith was a grandson of Penda's predecessor Cearl.

It was probably at some point during Oswald's reign that Penda fought with the East Angles and defeated them, killing their king <a href="Egric%20of%20East%20Anglia">Egric</a> and the former king <a href="Sigebert%20of%20East%20Anglia">Sigebert</a>, who had been brought out of retirement in a monastery against his will in the belief that his presence would motivate the soldiers. The time at which the battle occurred is uncertain; it may have been as early as 635, but there is also evidence to suggest it could not have been before 640 or 641. Presuming that this battle took place before the Battle of Maserfield, it may have been that such an expression of Penda's ambition and emerging power made Oswald feel that Penda had to be defeated for Northumbrian dominance of southern England to be secured or consolidated.

Penda's brother Eowa was also said by the "Historia Brittonum" and the "<a href="Annales%20Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a>" to have been a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The question of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and it is also possible that Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son <a href="Peada%20of%20Mercia">Peada</a> was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.

Another possibility was suggested by Brooks: Penda might have lost power at some point after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians for at least some of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield.

On 5 August 642, Penda defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Maserfield, which was fought near the lands of the Welsh, and Oswald was killed. Surviving <a href="Welsh%20poetry">Welsh poetry</a> suggests that Penda fought in alliance with the men of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">Powys</a>—apparently he was consistently allied with some of the Welsh—perhaps including <a href="Cynddylan%20ap%20Cyndrwyn">Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn</a>, of whom it was said that "when the son of Pyb desired, how ready he was", presumably meaning that he was an ally of Penda, the son of Pybba. If the traditional identification of the battle's location with <a href="Oswestry">Oswestry</a> is correct, then this would indicate that it was Oswald who had taken the offensive against Penda. It has been suggested that he was acting against "a threat posed to his domination of Mercia by a hostile alliance of Penda and Powys." According to <a href="Reginald%20of%20Durham">Reginald of Durham</a>'s 12th century "<a href="Vita%20Sancti%20Oswaldi">Life of Saint Oswald</a>", Penda fled into Wales before the battle, at which point Oswald felt secure and sent his army away. This explanation of events has been regarded as "plausible" but is not found in any other source, and may, therefore, have been Reginald's invention.

According to Bede, Penda had Oswald's body dismembered, with his head, hands and arms being placed onto stakes (this may have had a pagan religious significance); Oswald thereafter came to be revered as a <a href="saint">saint</a>, with his death in battle as a Christian king against pagans leading him to be regarded as a <a href="martyr">martyr</a>.

Eowa was killed at Maserfield along with Oswald, although on which side he fought is unknown. It may well be that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the "Historia Brittonum" regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.

The "Historia Brittonum" may also be referring to this battle when it says that Penda first freed ("separavit") the Mercians from the Northumbrians. This may be an important clue to the relationship between the Mercians and the Northumbrians before and during Penda's time. There may have existed a "Humbrian confederacy" that included the Mercians until Penda broke free of it. On the other hand, it has been considered unlikely that this was truly the first instance of their separation: it is significant that Cearl had married his daughter to Edwin during Edwin's exile, when Edwin was an enemy of the Northumbrian king <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelfrith</a>. It would seem that if Cearl was able to do this, he was not subject to Æthelfrith; thus it may be that any subject relationship only developed after the time of this marriage.

The battle left Penda with a degree of power unprecedented for a Mercian king—Kirby called him "without question the most powerful Mercian ruler so far to have emerged in the midlands" after Maserfield—and the prestige and status associated with defeating the powerful Oswald must have been very significant. Northumbria was greatly weakened as a consequence of the battle; the kingdom became fractured to some degree between <a href="Deira%20%28kingdom%29">Deira</a> in its southern part and Bernicia in the north, with the Deirans acquiring a king of their own, <a href="Oswine%20of%20Deira">Oswine</a>, while in Bernicia, Oswald was succeeded by his brother, <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu</a>. Mercia thus enjoyed a greatly enhanced position of strength relative to the surrounding kingdoms. Stenton wrote that the battle left Penda as "the most formidable king in England", and observed that although "there is no evidence that he ever became, or even tried to become, the lord of all the other kings of southern England ... none of them can have been his equal in reputation".

Defeat at Maserfield must have weakened Northumbrian influence over the West Saxons, and the new West Saxon king <a href="Cenwealh%20of%20Wessex">Cenwealh</a>—who was still pagan at this time—was married to Penda's sister. It may be surmised that this meant he was to some extent within what Kirby called a "Mercian orbit". However, when Cenwealh (according to Bede) "repudiated" Penda's sister in favour of another wife, Penda drove Cenwealh into exile in East Anglia in 645, where he remained for three years before regaining power. Who governed the West Saxons during the years of Cenwealh's exile is unknown; Kirby considered it reasonable to conclude that whoever ruled was subject to Penda. He also suggested that Cenwealh may not have been able to return to his kingdom until after Penda's death.

In 654, the East Anglian king <a href="Anna%20of%20East%20Anglia">Anna</a>, who had harboured the exiled Cenwealh, was killed by Penda. He was succeeded by a brother, <a href="Aethelhere%20of%20East%20Anglia">Aethelhere</a>; since Aethelhere was subsequently a participant in Penda's doomed invasion of Bernicia in 655 ("see <a href="%23Final%20campaign%20and%20the%20battle%20of%20the%20Winwaed">below</a>"), it may be that Penda installed Aethelhere in power. It has been suggested that Penda's wars against the East Angles "should be seen in the light of interfactional struggles within East Anglia." It may also be that Penda made war against the East Angles with the intention of securing Mercian dominance over the area of <a href="Middle%20Anglia">Middle Anglia</a>, where Penda established his son Peada as ruler.

In the years after Maserfield, Penda also destructively waged war against Oswiu of Bernicia on his own territory. At one point before the death of Bishop <a href="Aidan%20of%20Lindisfarne">Aidan</a> (31 August 651), Bede says that Penda "cruelly ravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near" and besieged the royal Bernician stronghold of <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a>. When the Mercians were unable to capture it—"not being able to enter it by force, or by a long siege"—Bede reports that they attempted to set the city ablaze, but that it was saved by a sacred wind supposedly sent in response to a plea from the saintly Aidan: "Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda does!" The wind is said to have blown the fire back towards the Mercians, deterring them from further attempts to capture the city. At another point, some years after Aidan's death, Bede records another attack. He says that Penda led an army in devastating the area where Aidan died—he "destroyed all he could with fire and sword"—but that when the Mercians burned down the church where Aidan died, the post against which he was leaning at the time of his death was undamaged; this was taken to be a miracle. No open battles are recorded as being fought between the two sides before the Winwaed in 655 ("see" <a href="%23Final%20campaign%20and%20the%20battle%20of%20the%20Winwaed">below</a>), however, and this may mean that Oswiu deliberately avoided battle due to a feeling of weakness relative to Penda. This feeling may have been in religious as well as military terms: N. J. Higham wrote of Penda acquiring "a pre-eminent reputation as a god-protected, warrior–king", whose victories may have led to a belief that his pagan gods were more effective for protection in war than the Christian God.

Despite these apparent instances of warfare, relations between Penda and Oswiu were probably not entirely hostile during this period, since Penda's daughter <a href="Cyneburh">Cyneburh</a> married <a href="Alhfrith%20of%20Deira">Alhfrith</a>, Oswiu's son, and Penda's son Peada married <a href="Alhflaed">Alhflaed</a>, Oswiu's daughter. According to Bede, who dates the events to 653, the latter marriage was made contingent upon the <a href="baptism">baptism</a> and conversion to Christianity of Peada; Peada accepted this, and the preaching of Christianity began among the Middle Angles, whom he ruled. Bede wrote that Penda tolerated the preaching of Christianity in Mercia itself, despite his own beliefs:

Nor did King Penda obstruct the preaching of the word among his people, the Mercians, if any were willing to hear it; but, on the contrary, he hated and despised those whom he perceived not to perform the works of faith, when they had once received the faith, saying, "They were contemptible and wretched who did not obey their God, in whom they believed." This was begun two years before the death of King Penda.

Peada's conversion and the introduction of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.

Middle Anglia as a political entity may have been created by Penda as an expression of Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to have been a number of small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> and <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called <a href="Merewalh">Merewalh</a> ruled over the <a href="Magonsaete">Magonsaete</a>; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.

In 655, Penda invaded Bernicia with a large army, reported to have been 30 warbands, with 30 royal or noble commanders ("duces regii", as Bede called them), including rulers such as <a href="Cadafael%20Cadomedd%20ap%20Cynfeddw">Cadafael ap Cynfeddw</a> of Gwynedd and Aethelhere of East Anglia. Penda also enjoyed the support of <a href="Aethelwald%20of%20Deira">Aethelwald</a>, the king of Deira and the successor of Oswine, who had been murdered on Oswiu's orders in 651; Bede says Aethelwald acted as Penda's guide during his invasion.

The cause of this war is uncertain. There is a passage in Bede's "Ecclesiastical History" that suggests Aethelhere of East Anglia was the cause of the war. On the other hand, it has been argued that an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede's meaning on this point, and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war. Although, according to Bede, Penda tolerated some Christian preaching in Mercia, it has been suggested that he perceived Bernician sponsorship of Christianity in Mercia and Middle Anglia as a form of "religious colonialism" that undermined his power, and that this may have provoked the war. Elsewhere the possibility has been suggested that Penda sought to prevent Oswiu from reunifying Northumbria, not wanting Oswiu to restore the kingdom to the power it had enjoyed under Edwin and Oswald. A perception of the conflict in terms of the political situation between Bernicia and Deira could help to explain the role of Aethelwald of Deira in the war, since Aethelwald was the son of Oswald and might not ordinarily be expected to ally with those who had killed his father. Perhaps, as the son of Oswald, he sought to obtain the Bernician kingship for himself.

According to the "Historia Brittonum", Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu; this site has been identified with <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>, in the north of Oswiu's kingdom. Oswiu tried to buy peace: in the "Historia Brittonum", it is said that Oswiu offered treasure, which Penda distributed among his British allies. Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda, who "resolved to extirpate all of [Oswiu's] nation, from the highest to the lowest". Additionally, according to Bede, Oswiu's son <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a> was being held hostage "at the court of Queen <a href="Cynwise">Cynwise</a>, in the province of the Mercians"—perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement. It would seem that Penda's army then moved back south, perhaps returning home, but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed in the region of <a href="Loidis">Loidis</a>, thought to be somewhere in the area around modern day <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, on a date given by Bede as 15 November. The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain, but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber. There is good reason to believe it may well have been the river now known as <a href="Cock%20Beck">Cock Beck</a> in the ancient kingdom of <a href="Elmet">Elmet</a>. The Cock Beck meanders its way through <a href="Pendas%20Fields">Pendas Fields</a>, close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds, before eventually joining the River Wharfe. This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also played a significant role in the much later <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a> in 1461. Another possibility is the River Went (a tributary of the River Don, situated to the north of modern-day Doncaster). It may be that Penda's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability, which would help explain Oswiu's victory over forces that were, according to Bede, much larger than his own.

The Mercian force was also weakened by desertions. According to the "Historia Brittonum", Cadafael of Gwynedd, "rising up in the night, escaped together with his army" (thus earning him the name "Cadomedd", or "battle-shirker"), and Bede says that at the time of the battle, Aethelwald of Deira withdrew and "awaited the outcome from a place of safety". According to Kirby, if Penda's army was marching home, it may have been for this reason that some of his allies were unwilling to fight. It may also be that the allies had different purposes in the war, and Kirby suggested that Penda's deserting allies may have been dissatisfied "with what had been achieved at "Iudeu"". At a time when the Winwaed was swollen with heavy rains, the Mercians were badly defeated and Penda was killed, along with the East Anglian king Aethelhere. Bede says that Penda's "thirty commanders, and those who had come to his assistance were put to flight, and almost all of them slain," and that more drowned while fleeing than were killed in the actual battle. He also says that Penda's head was cut off; a connection between this and the treatment of Oswald's body at Maserfield is possible. Writing in the 12th century, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> emphasised the idea that Penda was suffering the same fate as he had inflicted on others.

With the defeat at the Winwaed, Oswiu came to briefly dominate Mercia, permitting Penda's son Peada to rule its southern portion. Two of Penda's other sons, <a href="Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia">Wulfhere</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred</a>, later ruled Mercia in succession after the overthrow of Northumbrian control in the late 650s. The period of rule by Penda's descendants came to an end with his grandson <a href="Ceolred%20of%20Mercia">Ceolred</a>'s death in 716, after which power passed to descendants of Eowa for most of the remainder of the 8th century.

Penda's reign is significant in that it marks an emergence from the obscurity of Mercia during the time of his predecessors, both in terms of the power of the Mercians relative to the surrounding peoples and in terms of our historical awareness of them. While our understanding of Penda's reign is quite unclear, and even the very notable and decisive battles he fought are surrounded by historical confusion, for the first time a general outline of important events regarding the Mercians becomes realistically possible. Furthermore, Penda was certainly of great importance to the development of the Mercian kingdom; it has been said that his reign was "crucial to the consolidation and expansion of Mercia".

It has been claimed that the hostility of Bede has obscured Penda's importance as a ruler who wielded an "imperium" similar to that of other prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would have been based on personal as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.

Penda was the last great pagan warrior-king among the Anglo-Saxons. Higham wrote that "his destruction sounded the death-knell of English paganism as a political ideology and public religion." After Penda's death, the Mercians were converted to Christianity, and all three of Penda's reigning sons ruled as Christians. His daughters <a href="Cyneburh">Cyneburh</a> and <a href="Kyneburga%2C%20Kyneswide%20and%20Tibba">Cyneswith</a> became Christian and were saintly figures who according to some accounts retained their virginity through their marriages. There was purportedly even an infant grandson of Penda named <a href="Rumwold%20of%20Buckingham">Rumwold</a> who lived a saintly three-day life of fervent preaching. What is known about Penda is primarily derived from the history written by the Northumbrian Bede, a priest not inclined to objectively portray a pagan Mercian who engaged in fierce conflict with Christian kings, and in particular with Northumbrian rulers. Indeed, Penda has been described as "the villain of Bede's third book" (of the "Historia Ecclesiastica"). From the perspective of the Christians who later wrote about Penda, the important theme that dominates their descriptions is the religious context of his wars—for instance, the "Historia Brittonum" says that Penda prevailed at Maserfield through "diabolical agency"—but Penda's greatest importance was perhaps in his opposition to the supremacy of the Northumbrians. According to Stenton, had it not been for Penda's resistance, "a loosely compacted kingdom of England under Northumbrian rule would probably have been established by the middle of the seventh century." In summarising Penda, he wrote the following:

He was himself a great fighting king of the kind most honoured in Germanic saga; the lord of many princes, and the leader of a vast retinue attracted to his service by his success and generosity. Many stories must have been told about his dealings with other kings, but none of them have survived; his wars can only be described from the standpoint of his enemies ...

In the 1970s, Penda was depicted in two BBC television productions written by <a href="David%20Rudkin">David Rudkin</a>. He was played by <a href="Geoffrey%20Staines">Geoffrey Staines</a> in "<a href="Penda%27s%20Fen">Penda's Fen</a>" (1974), and by <a href="Leo%20McKern">Leo McKern</a> in "The Coming of the Cross" (1975).
