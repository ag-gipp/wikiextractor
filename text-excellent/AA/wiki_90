William Bostock

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> William Dowling Bostock, (5 February 1892 – 28 April 1968) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). During <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a> he led <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, the Air Force's main operational formation, with responsibility for the defence of Australia and air offensives against <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> targets in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>. His achievements in the role earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the American <a href="Medal%20of%20Freedom%20%281945%29">Medal of Freedom</a>. General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> described him as "one of the world's most successful airmen".

A veteran of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Bostock first saw combat as a soldier in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>, then as a pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, where he earned the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%20%28Belgium%29">Belgian Croix de guerre</a>. He joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921 and by 1941 had risen to become its third most senior officer, serving as Director of Training from 1930 to 1931, commanding officer of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> from 1931 to 1936, and Director of Operations and Intelligence from 1938 to 1939.

The <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> at the outbreak of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, a friend of twenty years. Appointed <a href="Air%20officer%20commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones over control of the Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">Member of Parliament</a>.

Bostock was born in <a href="Surry%20Hills%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Surry Hills</a>, an inner-city suburb of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, to an English father, also named William, and a Spanish mother, Mary. He was educated at <a href="The%20School%2C%20Mount%20Victoria">The School, Mount Victoria</a>, in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a> region of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, where he completed his junior certificate. The family later moved to <a href="Burwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Burwood</a>, in Sydney's <a href="Inner%20West%20%28Sydney%29">Inner West</a>. After leaving school Bostock was employed as an <a href="Apprenticeship">apprentice</a> with the <a href="Marconi%20Company">Marconi Company</a> for two-and-a-half years, and spent time at sea as a <a href="Radio">wireless</a> operator.

In November 1914, Bostock joined the 2nd Signal Troop of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) as a <a href="sapper">sapper</a>. He landed at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> on 25 April 1915, serving there until August, when he was evacuated suffering from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. He returned to active duty in January 1916, and was promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> the following month. Raised to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>, Bostock was posted to Egypt with the <a href="ANZAC%20Mounted%20Division">ANZAC Mounted Division</a> in April 1916, and saw action against Turkish forces in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>.

Bostock transferred from the AIF to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> Special Reserve on 18 February 1917, and was commissioned as a probationary <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. He was posted to <a href="No.%2048%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 48 Squadron</a> in August, following pilot training in Egypt and England. Bostock fought on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> and was awarded the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%20%28Belgium%29">Belgian Croix de guerre</a>. He was invalided back to Britain in March 1918, after which he transferred to the newly created <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF).

Bostock married his Australian fiancée, Gwendolen Norton, in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> on 6 March 1919. The couple had two daughters, one of whom, Gwendolen Joan, would serve as a <a href="cipher">cipher</a> officer in the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF) during World War II. Bostock retired from the RAF and returned to civilian life in Australia that October. In September 1921, he joined the recently formed <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and was commissioned a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>. He became a friend and mentor to Flying Officer (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, another World War I veteran, who had flown with the Australian Flying Corps and had joined the Air Force in March. By mid-1922 Bostock had been promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>.

Having served at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 FTS), <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, since entering the RAAF, Bostock was posted to Britain in 1926 to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. While there he was admonished by the college's commandant, via letter, due to the particular school he had chosen for his daughter and because he did his own gardening; Bostock was said to have returned the letter marked "noted and ignored". On his return to Australia as a <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in 1928, he took charge of No. 1 FTS, and became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, in December 1929. From 1931 to 1936 Bostock was commanding officer (CO) of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s and, later, <a href="Hawker%20Hart">Hawker Demon</a>s. At the time, his position as No. 3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the unit's base, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales. A <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> from 1934, he was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> on 31 May 1935. Following a two-year posting in Britain on the staff of <a href="No.%201%20Group%20RAF">No. 1 Bomber Group</a>, Bostock was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> on 1 September 1938 and made Director of Operations and Intelligence. Within a year he had become <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>.

The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff position that Bostock occupied at the outbreak of World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy had the authority to act in place of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in October 1940; the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> on 1 June 1940 and substantive <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> on 1 October 1941. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the 1942 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>.

Third in seniority in the RAAF after Air Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a> and Air Vice Marshal <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>, and considered, in the words of historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, to be "among the Air Force's best brains" at the time, Bostock was a prime candidate for the position of CAS in May 1942. He was also first choice of the incumbent CAS, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, whose two-year term was coming to an end. Bostock's closeness to Burnett, who had made no secret of his contempt for <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>'s <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Federal Labor government</a>, damaged his chances for selection and his friend, George Jones, then only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore, took the position. Although he had expected to be made CAS, Bostock warmly congratulated Jones, possibly expecting that his (Bostock's) new role as <a href="Chief%20of%20staff%20%28military%29">chief of staff</a> to the Commander of Allied Air Forces, Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Brett%20%28military%29">George Brett</a>, with responsibility for air operations in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), would prove the more important appointment in a time of war.

In August 1942, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, Supreme Commander SWPA, replaced Lieutenant General Brett with Major General (later General) <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>. Kenney created two new formations subordinate to Allied Air Forces Headquarters: the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>. Bostock was chosen to be <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> RAAF Command, with twenty-four Australian squadrons at his disposal plus one each from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under Bostock's command were those based in <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> as <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group RAAF</a> (No. 9 OG), controlled by Fifth Air Force. RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and <a href="North%20Western%20Area%20Campaign">conducting operations</a> against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>.

By the end of 1943, No. 9 OG, originally the RAAF's mobile strike formation, had effectively become a static garrison force in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, which led to the establishment of No. 10 Operational Group (No. 10 OG) on 13 November 1943 at <a href="Lae%20Nadzab%20Airport">Nadzab</a>, under the command of Group Captain <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>. In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No. 9 OG, as well as responsibility for the <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> and <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> sectors. Bostock again recommended changing No. 9 OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing No. 10 OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from the infusion of new squadrons. No. 9 OG became <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a> on 11 April. On 14 September, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred; Curtin meanwhile authorised changing No. 10 OG's name to <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF), with effect from 25 October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.
On 15 March 1945, Bostock established a forward headquarters on <a href="Morotai">Morotai Island</a> to directly control No. 1 TAF for the upcoming <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Oboe</a> operations, the reoccupation of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Kenney gave him responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines, and the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> (RNZAF) units which were based in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> to support the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a> were assigned to RAAF Command. Bostock wrote to Kenney, "I am particularly anxious that the 1st Tactical Air Force should continue to be employed as a forward offensive formation rather than in a garrison role". In April, Kenney's Allied Air Headquarters issued an order that Bostock would be named Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAAF Command, because he had several Air Officers Commanding (AOCs) reporting to him. Bostock duly passed on this change of nomenclature to his subordinate units but Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne vetoed the change in June.

Bostock had control of the USAAF Fifth and <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a>s, as well as No. 1 TAF, during <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">Operation Oboe One</a>, the invasion of <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan</a>, commencing 1 May 1945. By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17,000 personnel. On <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">Operation Oboe Six</a>, the invasion of <a href="Labuan%20Territory">Labuan</a>–<a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> in June, Bostock also had at his disposal aircraft based in Australia under <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western</a> and <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Commands</a>. For <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">Operation Oboe Two</a>, the invasion of Balikpapan in July, Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons. His aim, in concert with that of Kenney and <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> commander Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a>, was to deliver the heaviest aerial bombardment possible against enemy targets, to enable Australian assault forces to land with minimal casualties. Together with a naval barrage, this resulted in a "scene of indescribable ruin" on the battlefield, and allowed seventeen waves of troops to disembark their landing craft without loss. MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive "flawless", while General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, congratulated Bostock on his "high order of control" and "ready and full cooperation" throughout the Borneo campaign.

From 1942, the structure of the RAAF was divided such that Bostock was in operational charge of the Air Force in the South West Pacific but relied on Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Jones</a> as CAS for supplies of manpower and equipment, while Jones was nominally in command of the entire RAAF but played no part in directing its major air operations against Japan. The situation was, according to <a href="George%20Odgers">George Odgers</a>, a source of "acute personal tension" between the two senior officers for the remainder of the war. It was exacerbated by the fact that although the CAS was "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" head of the RAAF, Jones' rank of air vice marshal was no higher than Bostock's. Air Force historian Alan Stephens later commented: "The system of divided command... was not an ideal arrangement, but with men of goodwill it could have worked. Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind..."
Bostock's relationship to Kenney permitted him to ignore operational requests from Jones, while Jones continued to assert administrative control over Bostock's command. When Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command in April 1943 and replace him with Air Commodore <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, AOC of No. 9 Operational Group, Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command. Kenney threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government, and some time later MacArthur told Curtin that Hewitt "was not an adequate replacement" for Bostock. The matter was allowed to drop, but the rivalry continued. In January 1945, an acrimonious series of cables was exchanged between the two air vice marshals. Jones complained to Bostock of the latter's "insubordinate tone" and "repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters". Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was "responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you", and that he would "continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference".

Their feud was blamed for contributing to the low morale that precipitated the so-called "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" of April 1945, when a group of senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets. Alerted to the issue by No. 1 TAF's commander, Air Commodore <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations. According to historian Kristen Alexander, his methods were construed as an attempt to "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up"; one of the "mutineers", Squadron Leader <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Waddy">John Waddy</a>, quoted Bostock as saying, "I will leave these applications on the table and if you pick them up, all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it". When the pilots refused to drop the matter, Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale on the island to be at a "dangerously low level" and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Scherger</a>. Kenney concurred with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby. A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock: "I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it."

The conflict between the commanders reached its nadir during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">invasion of Tarakan</a> in May 1945, when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully "fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck" when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence. Over all, the dual system of control and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.

Bostock and Jones represented the RAAF at the <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Japanese surrender</a> aboard on 2 September 1945. RAAF Command was disbanded the same day. Bostock was one of several senior Air Force commanders summarily retired early in 1946, in his case six years before the compulsory retirement age of 60. Among the reasons for Bostock's dismissal were, according to private government papers, an "inability to work in harmony with certain other high ranking RAAF officers", and "lack of balance and appreciation of responsibility". He appealed the decision, citing a letter from MacArthur that described him as "one of the world's most successful airmen ... superior in every respect", but was unsuccessful. Newspapers raised questions about Bostock's departure, "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Melbourne%29">The Herald</a>" in Melbourne speculating on the part played by rivalries within the service.

After his retirement from the military, Bostock went into journalism and become an aviation correspondent for "The Herald". He wrote a series of articles criticising the Air Force's organisation and presenting his side of the story of RAAF Command, motivated partly by his belief that the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of Australia in World War II</a> would fail to adequately cover it. The articles caused considerable controversy and prompted the Minister for Air, <a href="Arthur%20Drakeford">Arthur Drakeford</a>, to make a formal response in Federal Parliament, labelling Bostock's allegations "malicious and unjustified".

Bostock was decorated twice in 1948 for his war service, in March with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> "in recognition of distinguished services whilst in command of air operations in the Borneo Campaign during the period March to September, 1945", and in April with the American <a href="Medal%20of%20Freedom%20%281945%29">Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm</a>. He entered politics in <a href="1949%20Australian%20federal%20election">1949</a>, standing as a <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> candidate for the Federal <a href="Division%20of%20Indi">Division of Indi</a> in Victoria. Elected to the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, he retained his seat until being defeated in the <a href="1958%20Australian%20federal%20election">1958 poll</a>. Bostock served on a joint committee for foreign affairs and sometimes came into conflict with his own party on matters of defence policy. He continued to contribute to "The Herald" while in government. During parliamentary debates in 1951 and again in 1957, Bostock spoke for "an integrated defence force with a single minister", advocating amalgamation of the four separate Departments of Defence, Air, Navy and Army into one Department of Defence, headed by the Minister for Defence. He further proposed that a single Commander-in-Chief lead the Army, Navy and Air Force; the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Naval Staff</a>, and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> would report directly to the new position. In 1973 the single-service departments were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>, and by 1984 a <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a> position had evolved to directly command all three armed services through their respective chiefs.

Bostock's wife Gwendolen died in 1947, and he married 33-year-old Nanette O'Keefe in Melbourne on 1 June 1951; they had three sons. He owned a property near <a href="Benalla%2C%20Victoria">Benalla</a>, in rural Victoria, where he died in 1968. Survived by his second wife and his five children, Bostock was accorded an Air Force funeral and cremated.

Interstate 15 in Arizona

Interstate 15 (I-15) is an <a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate Highway</a>, running from <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, United States, to the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–US border</a>, through <a href="Mohave%20County%2C%20Arizona">Mohave County</a> in northwest <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. Despite being isolated from the rest of Arizona, in the remote <a href="Arizona%20Strip">Arizona Strip</a>, and short in length at , it remains notable for its scenic passage through the <a href="Virgin%20River%20Gorge">Virgin River Gorge</a>. The highway heads in a northeasterly direction from the <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> border northeast of <a href="Mesquite%2C%20Nevada">Mesquite, Nevada</a>, to the <a href="Utah">Utah</a> border southwest of <a href="St.%20George%2C%20Utah">St. George, Utah</a>.

The south portion of I-15's route was built close to the alignment of the old <a href="U.S.%20Route%2091%20%28Arizona%29">U.S. Route 91</a> (US 91), but the northern section, through the Virgin River Gorge, was built along roadless terrain. The southern section of the highway was complete and open in the early 1960s, but the gorge section was inaccessible until 1973. When it opened, the Virgin River Gorge passage was the most expensive section of rural Interstate per mile.

The highway is signed and designated the "Veterans Memorial Highway", a designation which continues into <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Traffic volume along the Arizona section of I-15 is approximately 23,000 vehicles per day. The highway is also a part of the <a href="CANAMEX%20Corridor">CANAMEX Corridor</a>, a trade corridor in North America linking <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, Alberta in Canada and <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>.

The highway enters the state in Mohave County northeast of <a href="Mesquite%2C%20Nevada">Mesquite</a> and <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>, paralleling the old <a href="U.S.%20Route%2091%20%28Arizona%29">US 91</a> heading northeast on an alignment north of the <a href="Virgin%20River">Virgin River</a>. I-15 parallels the Virgin River for its entire length in Arizona, but the terrain abruptly becomes more rugged at mile 13, where the <a href="Virgin%20River%20Gorge">Virgin River Gorge</a> begins. The first interchange is exit 8 at <a href="Littlefield%2C%20Arizona">Littlefield</a>, where old US 91 turns north to avoid the gorge. I-15 crosses the river for the first time just beyond Littlefield, and soon passes another interchange serving local roads eastwards. This exit, exit 9, is a <a href="right-in/right-out">right-in/right-out</a> design with <a href="frontage%20road">frontage road</a>s, constructed after the initial opening. Access under I-15 is provided just south of the ramps.

Beyond exit 9, I-15 enters the Virgin River Gorge, first passing through "The Narrows". Here, the gorge features <a href="limestone">limestone</a> cliffs that are as high as above the highway. Several pulloffs allow access to these cliffs. Within the canyon, through which it ascends northbound and descends southbound, five bridges cross the river. The highway generally follows the winding course of the river, but several <a href="rock%20cut">rock cut</a>s bypass bends.

The canyon opens up slightly at the <a href="Cedar%20Pocket%20Reservoir">Cedar Pocket</a> interchange (exit 18), allowing for a <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a>. This rest area was turned over to the federal <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> in 2002 which maintains the nearby <a href="Virgin%20River%20Gorge%20Recreation%20Area">Virgin River Gorge Recreation Area</a>. The rest area was demolished in 2009. I-15 continues to parallel the Virgin River, but begins to deviate more. Trees here include <a href="tamarix">tamarix</a>, <a href="ash%20tree">ash</a>, <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwoods</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>s and <a href="Yucca%20brevifolia">Joshua trees</a>. Wildflowers such as <a href="globemallow">globemallow</a>, <a href="Tagetes">marigold</a>, and <a href="sand%20verbena">sand verbena</a> dot the route in springtime. At mile 22.5, the highway crosses the Virgin River for the final time, continuing east along the smaller <a href="Black%20Rock%20Gulch">Black Rock Gulch</a> before then turning slightly northeast into a flatter area. The final interchange (exit 27) provides local access.

A <a href="weigh%20station">weigh station</a>/<a href="port%20of%20entry">port of entry</a> formerly served both sides of the road near mile 28 before the Utah state line. The weigh station/port of entry are now combined into a joint Arizona/Utah facility just north of the state line staffed by the <a href="Arizona%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Arizona Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) Motor Vehicle Division and <a href="Utah%20DOT">Utah DOT</a> Motor Carrier Division. I-15 continues on into Utah providing access to <a href="St.%20George%2C%20Utah">St. George</a> as well as <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a>.

The <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20%28trade%20route%29">Old Spanish Trail</a> from <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> had two routes through northwestern Arizona, splitting at <a href="Littlefield%2C%20AZ">Littlefield</a>; one went north towards central Utah, and the other went northeast through the Virgin River Gorge, straddling the state line to the <a href="Four%20Corners">Four Corners</a> area. When the <a href="Arrowhead%20Trail%20%28auto%20trail%29">Arrowhead Trail</a> was marked in the 1920s, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2091%20%28Arizona%29">U.S. Route 91</a> in 1926, automobile travelers between Nevada and Utah followed the northerly routing, turning east in Utah to reach <a href="St.%20George%2C%20UT">St. George</a>.

When the Interstates were planned, federal authorities decided to save over US 91 and pass through the <a href="Virgin%20River%20Gorge">Virgin River Gorge</a> to take advantage of its scenery and lower grades for trucks. Construction was completed first, in the early 1960s, on the portion between Nevada and the gorge. The bridges over Big Bend Wash were completed in 1962. The bridge over the Virgin River near Littlefield was completed by 1964. By 1965, the overpass over Black Rock Road (northwards) was finally complete.

Construction through the gorge was slower and much more difficult, and the segment could not fully open until December 14, 1973. To help quicken construction, the state of <a href="Utah">Utah</a> loaned a portion of their federal highway funds to Arizona. Even though the highway is of little importance to the transportation needs of Arizona, as it does not link any Arizona communities, it does serve as a vital link between <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a> and <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> to the southwest. Despite extra funding, however, challenges remained. Flash flooding and quicksand in the gorge repeatedly caused problems, with equipment and materials apparently disappearing overnight. Worse, the project was to claim a life, when in October 1969, a helicopter performing reconnaissance on the gorge crashed due to wind, killing the pilot. To help navigate the gorge's rugged and unforgiving terrain, a special piece of equipment called a <a href="swamp%20buggy">swamp buggy</a> had to be brought from <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Even with this help, the route still demanded construction of four bridges over Virgin River. The westernmost bridge and the bridge carrying the northbound lanes at the third bridge location from the west were completed in 1972. By 1973, all five bridges were finally complete.

Even before its opening, it was promoted as the most scenic highway in the state; a 1988 article in "<a href="Arizona%20Highways">Arizona Highways</a>" said that the project "enhanced rather than distracted from Nature's handiwork". The Virgin River was rechanneled 12 times in what was the most expensive rural freeway in the country, at the price of approximately or in 2007 dollars.

Poitevin horse

The Poitevin, also called Mulassier ("mule-breeder"), Poitevin Mulassier or Trait Mulassier is a <a href="draft%20horse">draft horse</a> from the <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> area of France. It is a late-maturing breed with strong bones, known for its calm nature. It is found in many solid <a href="equine%20coat%20color">coat colors</a>, the result of <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a>ing with several other European draft breeds throughout its history, and is the only French draft horse to be found in <a href="bay%20dun">bay dun</a>. Today, Poitevins are used mainly for <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, although some are used for riding and <a href="equine%20therapy">equine therapy</a>.

Enthusiasts claim descent from the horses painted on the cave walls of <a href="Lascaux">Lascaux</a>, though this has not been verified by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>s and clergy in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of <a href="mule">mule</a>s, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.

A <a href="studbook">studbook</a> was created for the breed in 1884, and was <a href="closed%20stud%20book">closed</a> in 1922. A breeders' association was created in 1923. The first half of the 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules due to increased <a href="mechanization">mechanization</a>, and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of <a href="horse%20meat">meat</a>. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed <a href="genetic%20bottleneck">genetic bottleneck</a>ing and a severe risk of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>, and led to the establishment of a <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation plan</a>. Despite a slight increase in popularity at the beginning of the 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.

The body of the Poitevin is slender for a <a href="draft%20horse">heavy horse</a> and longer than other French draft breeds. It stands high, with <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s averaging and <a href="mare">mare</a>s 15.3 hands. The heavy clay and rich minerals of its homeland help it to develop strong bones, and it is late to reach physical maturity, generally around 6 to 7 years.

The head is long and strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck is long and the shoulders are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the <a href="withers">withers</a> prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well <a href="feathering%20%28horse%29">feathered</a>, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed has been known for its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.

The Poitevin is found in a wide variety of <a href="equine%20coat%20color">colors</a>, which are partly the result of the many breeds that influenced it. It is the only French draft horse that can be found in <a href="bay%20dun">bay dun</a>, a tan body color with black mane and tail and <a href="primitive%20markings">primitive markings</a>. This color likely comes from the Spanish horses that influenced the Flemish horses that later contributed to the breeding of the Poitevin. The most popular colors are pure <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> and <a href="seal%20brown%20%28horse%29">seal brown</a> (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with <a href="pangar%C3%A9">pangaré</a> markings), which came from the influence of Flemish and <a href="Friesian%20horse">Friesian horse</a>s. The breed standard accepts all colors, except for <a href="pinto%20horse">pinto</a> and <a href="leopard%20complex">leopard spotted</a>, and it is common to see <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a>, <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> and <a href="roan%20%28horse%29">bay roan</a> horses, the last probably being inherited from the <a href="Brabant%20%28horse%29">Brabant</a> breed. <a href="Chestnut%20%28coat%29">Chestnut</a> and <a href="roan%20%28horse%29">chestnut roan</a> are also seen, both being a legacy of <a href="Breton%20horse">Breton</a> crosses in the breed.

The Poitevin breed was created in the marshes of the <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> region, especially around <a href="Lu%C3%A7on">Luçon</a>, <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a>, <a href="Melle%2C%20Deux-S%C3%A8vres">Melle</a> and <a href="Niort">Niort</a>. It was developed through a mixture of human and <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to the marshy area that it inhabited. Although described as a draft horse, it was not selected for draft purposes, and was never popular for that use.
Remains of prehistoric horses have been found in the Poitou region, with <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> remains (20,000 to 5,000 BC) located near <a href="Surg%C3%A8res">Surgères</a> and <a href="%C3%89chir%C3%A9">Échiré</a>. Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended directly from these horses, based on physical similarities, and claim a common origin with the <a href="Tarpan">Tarpan</a> horse painted on the <a href="Lascaux">Lascaux cave walls</a>. However, this has not been confirmed by scientific studies, and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research. Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from <a href="Rome">Rome</a> asking the <a href="Count%20of%20Poitou">Count of Poitou</a> for a <a href="mare">mare</a> from the region. These horses, like <a href="mule">mule</a>s, were a favorite among the <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>s and <a href="ecclesiastical">ecclesiastical</a> personnel in the <a href="medieval">medieval</a> era, and were sold around Niort, <a href="Saint-Maixent">Saint-Maixent</a>, <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a>, <a href="Dauphin%C3%A9">Dauphiné</a>, <a href="Languedoc">Languedoc</a> and in Spain. The number of horses in the area, however, was not well known before the 17th century.

The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to develop in 1599 when King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a> requested that Dutch and Flemish engineers, led by <a href="Humphrey%20Bradley">Humphrey Bradley</a>, begin draining the Poitou marshes. They brought with them Friesian, Brabant and a type of Flemish work horse that was well known in the 13th century. These horses stood under and weighed up to . They were crossed with native Poitou mares, and this crossbreeding created a large, slow type, similar to the Flemish work horses of the Dutch marshes. This type was the forerunner of the modern Poitevin breed.

At the end of the 18th century, the French government tried to impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight <a href="Norman%20horse">Norman</a> and <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> horses to create <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.

Poitevin mares were crossbred with <a href="Poitou%20donkey">Poitou donkey</a>s to create the famous <a href="Poitou%20mule">Poitou mule</a>, a large, hardy breed. As mules are <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>s, and thus <a href="sterility%20%28physiology%29">sterile</a>, they can only be created through crossing a donkey and a horse. The industry of mule breeding in Poitou has existed since at least the 18th century, when it was opposed by the government <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a> administration that was attempting to breed cavalry horses for French troops. At the beginning of the 19th century, the government prohibited breeding mules from mares taller than , and threatened to <a href="castrate">castrate</a> all donkeys in the region. In the 1860s, equine historian <a href="Eugene%20Gayot">Eugene Gayot</a> described a horse that he called the ""poitevine mulassière"", and stated that the main purpose of this breed was to produce mares from which to breed mules. He added that this breed was also called the Poitevin. Mares of many breeds were used to produce mules at that point in history, but Gayot noted that the heavy mares from the Poitou marshes produced the best mules, likely because the Poitevin mares bequeathed to their descendents the same heavy bone structure.

Although the Poitevin was not the only breed of horse used for the production of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the <a href="Deux-S%C3%A8vres">Deux-Sèvres</a> region, especially in the district of Melle, near <a href="Lu%C3%A7on">Luçon</a> and <a href="Saint-Maixent">Saint-Maixent</a>, mule breeding began to be concentrated in "ateliers" (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.

Poitevin <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a>s and <a href="filly">fillies</a> were sold at fairs in <a href="Marans%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Marans</a>, <a href="Nuaill%C3%A9">Nuaillé</a>, <a href="Surg%C3%A8res">Surgères</a>, <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>, <a href="Pont-l%27Abb%C3%A9">Pont-l'Abbé</a> and <a href="Saujon">Saujon</a>. In 1867, there were 50,000 pure and crossbred mares. By the early 20th century, there were tens of thousands of Poitevins in France, but this period saw the beginning of the breed's decline. Poitevin colts, which were not used for the breeding of mules, were considered "soft" and less valuable than the major draft horse breed of the 19th century – the <a href="Percheron">Percheron</a>. Some horse dealers purchased young gray Poitevin horses, fed them heavily to make them larger and stronger, and then sold them at the age of four as Percherons. These "Percherons" were transported to areas such as <a href="Saintonge">Saintonge</a>, <a href="Yonne">Yonne</a>, <a href="Nivernais">Nivernais</a> and <a href="G%C3%A2tinais">Gâtinais</a>.
In the early 19th century, the breed was crossed with the Percheron, and with the <a href="Boulonnais%20horse">Boulonnais</a> between 1860 and 1867. During the same time period, crosses were made with the Breton, a practice supported by some breeders and denounced by others. Farmers in the region also began to add Breton blood into the Poitou mule, giving that animal a more square head and shorter ears. In the Poitevin horse breed, the crosses resulted in the body becoming longer and lighter, the legs longer and with less bone, and gray becoming more common as a coat color. In 1860, Eugene Gayot called the mares of the breed "heavy, common, soft and of medium size". Breeders chose horses with large joints, thick coats and a high <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a>, and had a preference for a black coat color.

In 1861, there were concerns that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and questions about whether the Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a lack of care shown towards <a href="breeding%20stock">breeding stock</a> selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in <a href="Saint-Maixent">Saint-Maixent</a> and <a href="La%20Roche-sur-Yon">La Roche-sur-Yon</a>, created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed <a href="studbook">studbook</a>.
The studbook for the Poitevin horse was created by the "Société Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-Sèvres" on June 26, 1884, with a horse section and a donkey section. The first edition was released December 31, 1885, setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses. In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry, backed by the purchase of mules by the <a href="French%20National%20Stud">French National Stud</a> and bonuses given to the best stallions.

After several revisions, the studbook was <a href="closed%20stud%20book">closed</a> in 1922 after registering 424 <a href="foundation%20stock">foundation</a> horses. The closing of the studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production pushed the group to reorganize in 1937 in order to gain more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.

In the first half of the 20th century, the mule breeding industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization. By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell, and the population dropped dramatically as there was no economic incentive for breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of <a href="horse%20meat">meat</a>, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of <a href="Comtois">Comtois</a> and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.

By 1950, there were only about 600 mares and 50 stallions left in the breed. Increasing mechanization and competition with other livestock hurt the Poitevin, as did a lack of promotion and protection. Between 1970 and 1990, the population of the Poitevin varied between 250 and 300 animals, with an average of 20 new horses entering the studbook each year. By the early 1990s, population numbers fell to the lowest in history. Sources are unclear on the number of living Poitevins in the early 1990s, but by 1996 one author says there were 64 newly registered foals and 28 approved breeding stallions, while another gives a total population of 293 horses in 1997.

The breed owes its survival to a small group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud. A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a <a href="genetic%20bottleneck">genetic bottleneck</a> in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>, leading the "Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race" to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and <a href="Belgian%20horse">Belgian</a> horses was suggested to increase <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> using <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.

The Poitevin had a slight increase in popularity at the beginning of the 21st century, and could count approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed. The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered. However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year and a slightly decreasing population. There is almost no crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock. In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the <a href="Institut%20national%20de%20la%20recherche%20agronomique">Institut national de la recherche agronomique</a>; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation</a> priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.

The studbook for the Poitevin is based in Niort, and the breed is the subject of a conservation breeding plan, the goal of which is to eventually revive the production of Poitou mules. The conservation plan includes an experimental infusion of blood from the Boulonnais, and is followed by 70 percent of breeders. "L'association nationale des races mulassières du Poitou" manages the studbook for the Poitevin horse, the Poitou donkey and the Poitou mule, and is recognized by the <a href="French%20Ministry%20of%20Agriculture">French Ministry of Agriculture</a>. Its goals are to ensure the selection of breeding stock that meet the physical characteristics expected of the breeds, to maintain the studbooks, and to promote the breeds. There is a <a href="breed%20show">breed show</a> held annually in the Poitou region.
The Poitevin breed has very low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals registered with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were <a href="mating">covered</a>, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, the highest number of foals registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 foals were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding farms are located in the Poitou area, including <a href="Vend%C3%A9e">Vendée</a> (especially around <a href="Fontenay-le-Comte">Fontenay-le-Comte</a> and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="Civray%2C%20Vienne">Civray</a>, and some in <a href="Charente">Charente</a>, near <a href="Ruffec%2C%20Charente">Ruffec</a>. There are National Studs located in <a href="Saintes%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Saintes</a> and Vendée. There are a few breeders in <a href="Maine-et-Loire">Maine-et-Loire</a>.

The breed is accessible to the public at "l'Asinerie nationale de la Tillauderie", an experimental farm in <a href="Dampierre-sur-Boutonne">Dampierre-sur-Boutonne</a> in <a href="Charente-Maritime">Charente-Maritime</a>, and at the Saintes National Stud. Members of the breed are exhibited at the annual <a href="Paris%20International%20Agricultural%20Show">Paris International Agricultural Show</a>. Approximately a dozen horses are exported each year, mainly to Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A few breeding stallions have been exported to the United States. Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a draft animal, as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal. A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.

As the stallions of the Poitevin breed could not be used to produce mules, they were generally sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in <a href="Berry">Berry</a>, <a href="Beauce%2C%20France">Beauce</a>, <a href="Perche">Perche</a> and <a href="Southern%20France">the Midi</a>. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling <a href="Bus">omnibuses</a>, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.

Today, Poitevins are used mainly for <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, both in competitions and for leisure use. They are used to pull carriages for tourists. Members of the breed can be ridden more comfortably than other draft breeds due to their slimmer build. They are also used extensively for <a href="equine%20therapy">equine therapy</a> in France. The Poitevin is used for light agricultural work in <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s, and for maintenance of natural <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s. The council of <a href="Ille-et-Vilaine">Ille-et-Vilaine</a> acquired a herd of Poitevins to maintain the marshes in the area. The Poitevin also has been used in movies, as a mount for forest monitors in <a href="Melun">Melun</a>, harnessed for urban work in Poitier and Niort, and for the collection of waste on the island of <a href="%C3%8Ele%20de%20R%C3%A9">Ré</a>.

The Huế chemical attacks occurred on 3 June 1963, when soldiers of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) poured liquid chemicals from <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> grenades onto the heads of praying <a href="Buddhism%20in%20Vietnam">Buddhist</a>s in <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a>, <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. The Buddhists were protesting against religious discrimination by the regime of the Roman Catholic President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>. The attacks caused 67 people to be hospitalised for blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments.

The protests were part of the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a>, during which the Buddhist majority in South Vietnam campaigned for religious equality after <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF%20Ph%E1%BA%ADt%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3n%20shootings">nine people were killed by government forces</a> while defying a ban that prevented them from flying the <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a> on <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>. The incident prompted the United States to privately threaten to withdraw support for Diệm's government and when the Americans finally reduced aid a few months later, the army took it as a green light for a coup. An inquiry determined that the chemical used in the attack was a liquid component from old French tear gas grenades that had never functioned properly. The findings exonerated the ARVN soldiers from charges that they had used <a href="poison%20gas">poison</a> or <a href="mustard%20gas">mustard gas</a>. The outcry over the attack had already forced Diệm to appoint a panel of three cabinet ministers to meet with Buddhist leaders for negotiations regarding religious equality. The talks led to the signing of the <a href="Joint%20Communique">Joint Communique</a>, but the policy changes it provided were not implemented and widespread protests continued, leading to the <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassination of Diệm</a> in a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">military coup</a>.

In a country where demographic surveys estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>'s policies generated claims of religious bias. A member of the <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Vietnam">Roman Catholic minority in Vietnam</a>, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, historians regard the government as being biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business favors, and tax concessions.

Diệm's family also seized businesses belonging to Buddhists in order to enrich themselves. Many officers in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> converted to Catholicism in the belief that their military prospects depended on it. Forgetting that he was talking to a Buddhist, Diệm once told a high-ranking officer, "Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted." The distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias intended to repel Vietcong guerrillas resulted in weapons only being given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies, and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of Buddhist <a href="pagoda">pagoda</a>s occurred. Some Buddhist villages converted "en masse" to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm's regime.

The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the "private" status that was imposed on Buddhism by the French colonial authorities, which required official permission to conduct public Buddhist activities and restricted the construction of Buddhist temples, was not repealed by Diệm. Furthermore, the land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from redistribution under <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> programs. Catholics were "de facto" exempt from the <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> labor that the government obliged all citizens to perform and the government disproportionately allocated funding to Catholic majority villages. Under Diệm, the Roman Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and in 1959, he dedicated the country to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. The <a href="Vatican%20flag">Vatican flag</a> was regularly flown at major public events in South Vietnam.

On 7 May 1963, government officials invoked a rarely enforced 1958 law known as Decree Number 10 to prohibit the display of religious flags, forbidding Buddhists from flying their <a href="Buddhist%20flag">flag</a> on <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>, the birthday of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists in the lead-up to the most important religious festival of the year, as Catholics had been allowed to display Vatican flags a week earlier at a celebration for Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a>. On 8 May, in Huế, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army broke up the protest by opening fire and throwing grenades at the demonstrators, leaving nine dead.

Diệm's denial of governmental responsibility for the incident, and instead blaming members of the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> insurgency, led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the <a href="religious%20discrimination">religious discrimination</a> of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute came to be known as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality. At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, had 16,000 military advisers in the country to assist the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">war against the Vietcong insurgency</a>, which sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted the dispute with the Buddhists to be resolved quickly so that it would not dampen public morale and detract from the fight against the Vietcong.

On 3 June, Buddhists held another series of protests across the country. In the morning, attention focused on the capital <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested in front of the Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood by. The crowd and a government official equipped with a loudspeaker exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among the crowd and attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors. 

When the crowd responded by taunting the soldiers as "stupid killers", the troops <a href="bayonet%23Commonwealth%20armies">fixed bayonets to their guns</a> and put on <a href="gas%20masks">gas masks</a> before charging at the protestors and throwing tear gas grenades at them. Some of the demonstrators ran away, while others remained stationary and began praying. Deaths and injuries were averted when a Buddhist leader urged the protestors to either retreat to a pagoda and receive medical treatment for the tear gas or to go home. When the entrance to the pagoda was blocked with barbed wire, some protestors simply sat on the ground and continued praying. After a standoff lasting almost three hours, troops wearing gas masks forcibly dispersed the crowd. The situation was worse in Huế, where Diệm had banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. At 13:00, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards the <a href="Tu%20Dam%20Pagoda">Từ Đàm Pagoda</a> in Huế for a rally, having gathered at the Bến Ngư Bridge near the <a href="Perfume%20River">Perfume River</a>. A confrontation ensued when the protestors attempted to cross the bridge. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowd. 

Government officials stood on trucks, using loudspeakers to call out above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong. At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. Of these, 40 suffered second-degree burns. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm. Demonstrations also happened in <a href="Quang%20Tri">Quang Tri</a> and <a href="Nha%20Trang">Nha Trang</a>, also on the central coast area.

By midnight, tensions were high as a curfew and martial law were enacted. Rumors circulated that three people had died, and "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" reported that police had lobbed <a href="blister%20gas">blister gas</a> into the crowd. Reports citing reliable sources claimed that Diệm was planning a military showdown against the Buddhists. The day after the attacks, Diệm installed a new mayor in <a href="Da%20Nang">Da Nang</a>, the largest city in central Vietnam, in a move that was seen as a response to the ongoing protests. Meanwhile, those involved in the protests who had not been taken to hospital retreated into the pagoda and continued to fast. Government authorities responded by placing barbed wire around the compound and cutting off water and electricity. The police prevented anybody from leaving or entering the temple.

US consul John Helble suspected that the ARVN troops had used tear gas, and in a report to the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a>, he noted that "possibly another type of gas which caused skin blisters" was used. Helble reported that the substance, although unidentified, had raised concerns by the <a href="US%20State%20Department">US State Department</a> that poison gas was used because the symptoms were not consistent with standard tear gas. 

If this were the case, Helble concluded that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn the actions of the troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from <a href="V%C5%A9ng%20T%C3%A0u">Vũng Tàu</a> in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. <a href="William%20Trueheart">William Trueheart</a>, who was in charge of the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a> while Ambassador <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a> was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State <a href="Nguyen%20Dinh%20Thuan">Nguyễn Đình Thuận</a> about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of <a href="mustard%20gas">mustard gas</a> and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks. The day after the attacks, there had been press reports that the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> had been used to transport troops of the <a href="Vietnamese%20Airborne%20Division">Airborne Division</a> to Huế, but this was denied two days later by a State Department spokesperson who said that no US aircraft or personnel had been involved in the transport of any Vietnamese servicemen or policemen.

Thuan started an inquiry into the usage of chemical weapons on the protestors. The investigation exonerated the Diệm regime of the most serious allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquid components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to vaporize as they were designed to. A further commission chaired by General <a href="Tran%20Van%20Don">Trần Văn Đôn</a> prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s. The tear gas used came in glass containers in the form of a liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapor upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> chemists in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> stocks. During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of <a href="chloroacetone">chloroacetone</a> and <a href="ethyl%20bromoacetate">ethyl bromoacetate</a> against German troops at <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, which was known to strongly irritate <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s. 

Chloroacetone turns brown-orange when exposed to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at tropical outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained <a href="phosgene%20oxime">phosgene oxime</a> or <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>. These two chemicals can be fatal, but none of the protestors in this incident died.

Diệm responded to the controversy of the chemicals by agreeing to formal talks with the Buddhist leaders. He appointed a three-member Interministerial Committee, which comprised Vice President <a href="Nguyen%20Ngoc%20Tho">Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ</a> as chairman, Thuan and Interior Minister <a href="Bui%20Van%20Luong">Bui Van Luong</a>. The first meeting with Buddhist leaders took place two days after the attacks and one of the issues discussed was the temple siege in Hue, and the cessation of protests if religious equality was implemented. Diệm appeared to soften his line, at least in public, in an address on 7 February when he said that some of the tensions were due to his officials lacking "sufficient comprehension and sensitivity" although there was no direct admission of fault regarding any of the violence in Hue since the start of the Buddhist crisis in May. Despite continuing protests, including public <a href="self-immolation">self-immolation</a>s by monks such as <a href="Thich%20Quang%20Duc">Thich Quang Duc</a>, a <a href="Joint%20Communique">Joint Communique</a> resulting from the discussions was signed in mid-June, which promised to end the Buddhist crisis.

The Joint Communique was not implemented and the situation continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">South Vietnam's Special Forces</a> to <a href="Xa%20Loi%20Pagoda%20raids">attack Buddhist pagodas across the country</a> on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, in addition to other government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">successful coup</a> in November, resulting in the <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassination of the president</a>. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist <a href="Vietcong">Vietcong</a> made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1894)

Petropavlovsk () was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Petropavlovsk-class%20battleship">her class</a> of three <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> during the last decade of the 19th century. The ship was sent to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> almost immediately after entering service in 1899, where she participated in the suppression of the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> the next year and was the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="First%20Pacific%20Squadron">First Pacific Squadron</a>.

At the beginning of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–1905, "Petropavlovsk" took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a>, where she was lightly damaged by Japanese shells and failed to score any hits in return. On 13 April 1904, the ship sank after striking one or more <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> near <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a>, in northeast China. Casualties numbered 27 officers and 652 enlisted men, including <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Stepan%20Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a>, the commander of the <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a>, and the <a href="war%20artist">war artist</a> <a href="Vasily%20Vereshchagin">Vasily Vereshchagin</a>. The arrival of the competent and aggressive Makarov after the Battle of Port Arthur had boosted Russian morale, which plummeted after his death.

The design of the "Petropavlovsk"-class ships was derived from the battleship , but was greatly enlarged to accommodate an armament of four and eight guns. While under construction, their armament was revised to consist of more powerful, higher-velocity, 12-inch guns; the 8-inch guns were replaced by a dozen guns. The ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . Designed to <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displace</a> , "Petropavlovsk" was almost overweight, displacing when completed. The ship was powered by two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a>, built by the British firm <a href="Hawthorn%20Leslie">Hawthorn Leslie</a>, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 14 <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of , but "Petropavlovsk" reached a speed of from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 725 men when serving as a flagship.

The four <a href="Russian%2012%20inch%2040%20caliber%20naval%20gun">12-inch</a> guns of the <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> were mounted in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one forward and one aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Designed to fire one round every 90 seconds, the actual rate of fire was half as fast. Their <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of twelve <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">six-inch</a> <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) gun</a>s. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s on the sides of the hull <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. Smaller guns were carried for defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, including a dozen QF <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s and twenty-eight <a href="Hiram%20Maxim">Maxim</a> QF <a href="QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom">guns</a>. They were also armed with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four tubes above water and two submerged tubes, all mounted on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ships carried 50 mines to be used to protect their <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">anchorage</a>.

Russian manufacturers of the <a href="nickel-steel">nickel-steel</a> armor used by "Petropavlovsk" were unable to fulfill the existing demand, so the ship's armor was ordered from <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> in America. Her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick. The main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of and her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor ranged from in thickness.

"Petropavlovsk" was named for the successful Russian defense during the 1854 <a href="Siege%20of%20Petropavlovsk">Siege of Petropavlovsk</a>. Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes, and late delivery of the main armament, the ship was constructed over a period of six years. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> on 19 May 1892, together with her two <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, at the <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyard">Galernii Island Shipyard</a> and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 9 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899, after which she was ordered to proceed to the Far East. "Petropavlovsk" departed <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> on 17 October and arrived at Port Arthur on 10 May 1900, becoming the flagship of Vice Admiral <a href="Nikolai%20Skrydlov">Nikolai Skrydlov</a> and the First Pacific Squadron. In mid-1900, the ship helped suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China. In February 1902, Vice Admiral <a href="Oskar%20Viktorovich%20Stark">Oskar Stark</a> assumed command of the squadron from Skrydlov and raised his flag on "Petropavlovsk". That same year, a radio was installed aboard the ship.

After the Japanese victory in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–1895, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and Korea, resulting in tensions between the two nations. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The situation was worsened by Russia's failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. The final straws were the news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These actions caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was inevitable. As tensions with Japan increased, the Pacific Squadron began <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring</a> in the outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.

On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. "Petropavlovsk" was not hit and <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d the following morning when the Japanese <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, attacked. Tōgō had expected the night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, and anticipated that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese 8- and 6-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. "Petropavlovsk" was lightly damaged in the engagement by one 6-inch and two 12-inch shells, killing two and wounding five. In return she fired twenty 12-inch and sixty-eight 6-inch shells at the Japanese battleships, but none hit. Displeased by the poor performance of the First Pacific Squadron, the <a href="Naval%20Ministry%20%28Russia%29">Naval Ministry</a> replaced Stark with the dynamic and aggressive Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov, regarded as the navy's most competent admiral, on 7 March. As a result of the damage incurred in the attack by the more heavily armored and the subsequent lengthy repair time, Makarov was compelled to retain "Petropavlovsk" as his flagship against his better judgement.

Having failed to <a href="blockade">blockade</a> or bottle up the Russian squadron at Port Arthur by sinking <a href="blockships">blockships</a> in the harbor's <a href="channel%20%28geography%29">channel</a>, Tōgō formulated a new plan. Ships were to mine the entrance to the harbor and then lure the Russians into the minefield in the hopes of sinking a number of Russian warships. Covered by four detachments of torpedo boat <a href="destroyers">destroyers</a>, the <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> "Koru-Maru" began to lay a minefield near the entrance to Port Arthur on the night of 31 March. The Japanese were observed by Makarov, who believed that they were Russian destroyers which he had ordered to patrol that area.

Early on the morning of 13 April, the Russian destroyer <a href="Russian%20destroyer%20Strashnii">"Strashnii"</a> fell in with four Japanese destroyers in the darkness while on patrol. Once her captain realized his mistake, the Russian ship attempted to escape but failed after a Japanese shell struck one of her torpedoes and caused it to detonate. By this time the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> had sortied to provide support, but it was only able to rescue five survivors before a Japanese squadron of protected cruisers attacked. Escorted by three protected cruisers, Makarov led "Petropavlovsk" and her sister out to support "Bayan", while ordering the rest of the First Pacific Squadron to follow as soon as they could. In the meantime, the Japanese had reported the Russian sortie to Tōgō, who arrived with all six Japanese battleships. Heavily outnumbered, Makarov ordered his ships to retreat and to join the rest of the squadron that was just exiting the harbor. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about from the shore, "Petropavlosk" struck one or more mines at 09:42 and sank almost instantly, taking with her 27 officers and 652 enlisted men, including Makarov and the war artist Vasily Vereshchagin. Seven officers and 73 men were rescued.

Makarov's arrival had boosted the morale of the squadron and his death dispirited the sailors and their officers. His replacement, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a>, was a career <a href="staff%20officer">staff officer</a> unsuited to lead a navy at war. He did not consider himself a great leader and his lack of charisma and passivity did nothing to restore the squadron's morale. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of "Petropavlovsk" and gave him a burial at sea.

Russian battleship Oslyabya

Oslyabya () was the second of the three second-class <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> at the end of the nineteenth century, although construction delays meant that she was the last to be completed. The ship was part of the <a href="Pacific%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">Second Pacific Squadron</a> sent to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05, and served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Baron <a href="Dmitry%20von%20F%C3%B6lkersam">Dmitry von Fölkersam</a>. "Oslyabya" was sunk on 27 May 1905 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>, and was the first all-steel battleship to be sunk by naval gunfire alone. Sources differ on the exact number of casualties, but over half her crew went down with the ship.

The design of the "Peresvet" class was inspired by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">British</a> second-class battleships of the . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiders like the Russian <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s and ; the "Peresvet"-class ships were designed to support the Russian cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.

"Oslyabya" had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . Designed to displace , she was almost overweight and displaced when built. Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a> using steam generated by 30 <a href="Belleville%20boiler">Belleville boiler</a>s. The engines were rated at , using <a href="forced%20draught">forced draft</a>, and designed to reach a top speed of . "Oslyabya", however, reached a top speed of from during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in September 1902. She carried a maximum of of coal which allowed her to steam for at a speed of .

The ship's <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of four <a href="254mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201891"></a> guns mounted in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of eleven <a href="Canet%20guns">Canet</a> <a href="152%20mm%2045%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF) guns</a>, mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>. Smaller guns were carried for defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. These included twenty <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892"></a> QF guns, twenty <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s and eight guns. She was also armed with five <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> to be used to protect her anchorage.

"Oslyabya"s <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> consisted of <a href="Harvey%20armor">Harvey armor</a> and was thick. The belt was high, of which the upper was intended to be above the waterline, but the ship was significantly overweight and only had showing at normal load. At <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>, the belt was completely submerged and her only protection was the four-inch upper belt. The <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a> of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of nine inches and her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ranged from thick.

"Oslyabya", named for <a href="Oslyabya">Rodion Oslyabya</a>, a 14th-century monk of the <a href="Troitse-Sergiyeva%20Lavra">Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra</a> and a hero of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kulikovo">Battle of Kulikovo</a> in 1380, was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> on 21 November 1895 by the <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyard">New Admiralty Shipyard</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 8 November 1898. Problems at the New Admiralty Shipyard delayed her completion until 1903 at a cost of 11,340,000 <a href="rubles">rubles</a>. The ship sailed for <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a> on 7 August 1903 with the armored cruiser , but "Oslyabya" ran aground in the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> on 21 August and was under repair until late November, first in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, then at <a href="La%20Spezia">La Spezia</a>, Italy. After repairs, the ship resumed her voyage to the Far East, but she was recalled to join the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> on 12 February 1904, following the start of the Russo-Japanese War three days previously. After arrival at St. Petersburg in April, "Oslyabya" was fitted with <a href="Barr%20%26amp%3B%20Stroud">Barr & Stroud</a> <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s, telescopic <a href="gun%20sight">gun sight</a>s, a new ventilation system, and <a href="Telefunken">Telefunken</a> radio equipment.

The Russian strategy since 1897 had been for ships from the Baltic Fleet to be ordered to the Far East if war with Japan broke out, while the First Pacific Squadron in Port Arthur would avoid a general fleet battle until reinforcements arrived. On 15 October 1904, "Oslyabya" set sail for Port Arthur from <a href="Liepaja">Libau</a> as von Fölkersam's <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the overall command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Zinovy%20Rozhestvensky">Zinovy Rozhestvensky</a>. Historian Mark Schrad said that: "This epic journey was the longest voyage of a coal-powered battleship fleet in history." En route to Denmark, the battleship was slightly damaged when the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> collided with her. When his ships reached the port of <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a>, Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky ordered his older battleships, under the command of von Fölkersam, to go through the Mediterranean and Red Sea to rendezvous with his main force in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Rozhestvensky led his squadron, including "Oslyabya", down the Atlantic coast of Africa, rounding <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, and reached the island of <a href="Nosy%20Be">Nosy Be</a> off the northwest coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905, where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. By this time Port Arthur had surrendered to the Japanese and he could not count on resupplying there, nor rendezvousing with the First Pacific Squadron. Rozhestvensky's reunited squadron sailed for <a href="Camranh%20Bay">Camranh Bay</a>, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the Third Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Nikolai%20Nebogatov">Nikolai Nebogatov</a>. These reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> on 14 May.

En route, Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships into three tactical <a href="division%20%28naval%29">divisions</a> for the forthcoming battle; the first consisted of the four new s commanded by himself, von Fölkersam commanded the Second Division that consisted of the battleships "Oslyabya", , and the armored cruiser , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the Third Division. Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet in order to keep morale up. "Oslyabya"s <a href="Captain%201st%20Rank">Captain 1st Rank</a> Vladimir Ber became the commander of the Second Division, while Nebogatov had no idea that he was now the squadron's de facto second-in-command.

While figures are not available for "Oslyabya", one Russian account after the battle said that the "Borodino"s were approximately overweight as they were overloaded with coal and other supplies that were stored high in the ships, reducing their <a href="Stability%20conditions">stability</a>. "Oslyabya"s main armor belt was fully submerged with a full load, much less any additional coal and supplies, and thus the four-inch-thick upper armor was the only available protection for the ship's waterline.

The Russians were spotted early on the morning of 27 May by Japanese ships as they entered the <a href="Korea%20Strait">Korea Strait</a> en route to Vladivostok. During the subsequent battle "Oslyabya" led the Second Division of the squadron and was initially the target of at least two battleships and a pair of armored cruisers when the Japanese opened fire at 14:10. As the Japanese approached, Rozhestvensky ordered the fleet to move from <a href="line%20ahead">line ahead</a> formation to parallel columns and "Oslyabya" was forced to almost stop in her tracks to avoid hitting the battleship , the last ship of Rozhestvensky's division, as she maneuvered. Almost immediately, the shells began inflicting damage, knocking out the rangefinder, wounding the gunnery officer and severing the cables connecting the guns to the Geisler <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control system</a>. Other hits shot away the <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> and knocked out the forward gun turret as well as three of the port six-inch guns. Splinters from one of the many hits entered her conning tower, killing the <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> and wounding most of the men inside. This caused the ship to fall out of line to starboard and she was engaged by six Japanese armored cruisers at short range. More serious were several large-caliber shells that struck along the ship's waterline about 15 minutes into the engagement that caused major flooding; they opened up enough of the ship's bow to the sea that her forward motion forced more and more water into her hull and she began <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">listing</a> to port. Flooding of her starboard forward <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> was ordered in an attempt to counteract the list, but it just added more weight forward and destroyed the ship's stability. "Oslyabya"s list increased to 12 degrees at 14:20, flooding many of the lower turrets. Her <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> touched the water around 15:10 and Ber ordered "abandon ship". The ship sank a few minutes later, with her starboard propeller still turning, taking Ber and 470 of her crew with her.

Characters of Carnivàle

There are several main characters in "<a href="Carniv%C3%A0le">Carnivàle</a>", an American <a href="television%20series">television</a> <a href="serial%20drama">serial drama</a> set in the United States <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>-era <a href="Dust%20Bowl">Dust Bowl</a> between 1934 and 1935 based on the true life of Sheila DeLeon . It aired on <a href="HBO">HBO</a> between 2003 and 2005. The show traces the disparate storylines of an ensemble of fictional characters revolving around two main characters: young Ben Hawkins working in a <a href="traveling%20carnival">traveling carnival</a>, and a <a href="California">California</a> preacher named Brother Justin Crowe.

"Carnivàle" has a large cast, amounting to eighteen main cast actors over its two-season run. Most characters are introduced in Ben's storyline: Samson, a <a href="dwarfism">dwarf</a> co-running the carnival with Management; Jonesy, Samson's right-hand man with a crippling knee injury; Apollonia and Sofie, two <a href="Fortune-telling">fortuneteller</a>s working a mother-daughter act; Lodz, a blind <a href="mentalist">mentalist</a>, and his lover, Lila the <a href="Bearded%20Lady">Bearded Lady</a>; the cootch (<a href="striptease">striptease</a>) Dreifuss family; <a href="snake%20charmer">snake charmer</a> Ruthie and her son Gabriel, a <a href="Strongman%20%28circus%29">strongman</a>; and many other <a href="sideshow">sideshow</a> performers. The supporting characters of Brother Justin's storyline are his sister Iris, his mentor Reverend Norman Balthus, radio show host Tommy Dolan, and convict Varlyn Stroud. Several characters appear in mysterious dreams and visions connecting the slowly converging storylines.

Show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a>'s original story pitch to HBO included elaborate character biographies, which he gave to the actors, the writers and the studio as an overview over the series' intended plot. These biographies were rewritten before the filming of the first season began. Receiving little to no mention in the series afterwards, the original character backgrounds were summarized on the official HBO website. After the show's cancellation, the writers revealed future character arcs and forwarded all original biographies to fans as part of the show's so-called "Pitch Document". Due to their nature, these sources do not offer <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> information per se, but provide a frame for the characters' motivation throughout the series.

The thematic and period setting of "Carnivàle" required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks to fit the 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.

Conceiving the initial script for "Carnivàle" between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a carnival environment in the 1930s <a href="Dust%20Bowl">Dust Bowl</a>, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He had grown up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. <a href="Freak%20show">Freaks</a> of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a <a href="Mythology%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le">complex fictional universe</a> based on a <a href="good%20and%20evil">good versus evil</a> theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to <a href="HBO">HBO</a>, Knauf presented "Carnivàle" as a collection of media samples from the perspective of a fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major "Carnivàle" characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of "Carnivàle" began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only get to know the characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves are confronted with "self-realization and becoming aware of these [supernatural] powers and learning to harness them, and the implications of this battle between good and evil." Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.


Ben Krohn Hawkins is the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> in "Carnivàle". He begins the story as a young <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> farmer and <a href="chain%20gang">chain gang</a> fugitive who is picked up by a <a href="traveling%20carnival">traveling carnival</a> when his mother dies. Ben has displayed inexplicable healing powers since childhood, and with the beginning of the series, he has begun to suffer dreams and visions of people unknown to him. As Ben learns from staying with the carnival, he seems to be related to Henry Scudder, a man who once worked at the carnival. He also learns that his powers come with a price – to give life, he must take life; to raise the dead, he has to deliberately kill someone else. When the beginning of season two makes the mysterious happenings in the carnival clearer, Ben is told to find the preacher of his dreams to prevent an unfolding chain of catastrophic events. Henry Scudder, at this point revealed to be Ben's father, allegedly knows the preacher's name, and after a number of near misses and harrowing encounters, Ben is able to bring Scudder before the carnival's Management. A fight ensues in which Ben is forced to kill Management, leaving him a full understanding of his powers. Season two concludes with Ben's setting out to confront Brother Justin in California, where they finally meet in battle in a cornfield. The carnies find Brother Justin slain and Ben passed out from his own grievous wounds. They take Ben back to their camp and leave New Canaan.

As his powers and use of powers already suggest in the series, Ben is an <a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Avataric Creature of Light</a>. An early draft of "Carnivàle", which consisted of diary entries by Benjamin "Ben" Hawkins, summarized his childhood as growing up on a run-down farm with his mother and grandfather in the belief that his father had died in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. After both his grandfather and mother had died from <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, he was "<a href="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> by a group of <a href="Carny">carnies</a>" in 1930. In a later version closer to the actual series, Ben left his mother's farm at age sixteen and fell into a criminal life in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. After receiving a twenty-year sentence in a state prison-farm for a failed <a href="bank%20robbery">bank robbery</a>, Ben planned his escape to return home to his sick mother, but he accidentally killed a prison guard who drew a gun on him. Show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a> gave the latter as Ben's chain gang background in the series.

The writers always intended Ben to be the leading man and hero of the series, and were looking for an actor to showcase a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality. Of the many actors auditioning, the producers found that Nick Stahl brought a "particular introspection" to the character, "project[ing] a great deal of sensitivity, of quiet intelligence, of pain." They also felt that his seemingly little-trained physique worked well for the 1930s period. Nick Stahl, who interpreted Ben as "very stoic", "very quiet", with a "dual nature" and a "real internal struggle going on", embraced this role as a personal challenge.

In reviewing the first three episodes, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" commented that "Ben is a taciturn hero, and Mr. Stahl does a remarkable job of wordlessly conveying his character's moods and yearnings, as well as his ungainly grace." "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" regarded "Stahl, with his watchful eyes, [as] one of the show's strengths. He has a boyish face, but the grim expression of a worn-out elder", and the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" said Stahl "speaks volumes with his eyes and weary frown, so much so that his understated portrayal almost carries the series." In a season 1 DVD review, <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> thought that "as the two leads, Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown are nothing short of brilliant. Ben Hawkins is a very isolated and quiet character, and yet he carries a significant part of the series on his shoulders. Without the right actor it could be disastrous, but Stahl brings a level of thoughtful emotion to the character such that a glance or a stare speaks volumes." DVDverdict felt in a season 2 review that "both Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown deliver perfect performances. Stahl's gradual acceptance of his own power, and his subsequent struggle, are fascinating."

For his portrayal of Ben Hawkins, Nick Stahl was nominated for a 2003 <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a> in the category "Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series". He was also nominated for a 2003 <a href="Golden%20Satellite%20Award">Golden Satellite Award</a> in the category "Best Performance by an Actor in a Series, Drama".


Brother Justin Crowe is the antagonist in "Carnivàle"; reviewers also saw in him a possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> <a href="minister%20%28religion%29">minister</a> who resides with his sister Iris in the small town of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a <a href="sanatarium">sanatarium</a> and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and <a href="Okies">Okies</a> outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Usher</a>" and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Omega</a>" arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.

Besides being the "Usher", Brother Justin is also an <a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Avataric Creature of Dark</a>. His spiritual presentation in the series, the <a href="Mythology%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%23The%20Tattooed%20Man%20and%20the%20tree">Tattooed Man</a>, was portrayed by <a href="Don%20Swayze">Don Swayze</a>. Show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a> saw in Brother Justin "one of the most complex devils", and envisioned <a href="Christopher%20Walken">Christopher Walken</a> to play him when he wrote the first draft of the show. Knauf originally designed Brother Justin as a preacher far along in his career as well as a recurring instead of a regular character, "much more evolved towards the dark side." An early draft of "Carnivàle" gave Brother Justin's real name as Lucius Crowe, a radio preacher who advocated ethnic hatred, especially for <a href="Romani%20people">Gypsies</a> and carnival folk. It also mentioned Brother Justin joining "The Order of the Knights of Jericho" between 1921 and 1923 and becoming its head in 1926. The completion of the construction of his "Temple of Jericho" was set in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> in 1928. At the series' start initially projected to occur in 1930, the character had already gathered a great army of followers through his "Church of the Air" radio sermons.

After seeing the preliminary pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers realized there was no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a> in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> priest; he rather settled on the <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with <a href="Father%20Coughlin">Father Coughlin</a>, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.

The producers added Justin's sister Iris as a supporting character in the revised series, and established a sexual tension between the two characters early on. While reviewers were unsure what to make of it, Daniel Knauf advertised the relationship as "just as warped and incestuous as ever" in the new season. Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) and <a href="Amy%20Madigan">Amy Madigan</a> (Iris) acknowledged the lust between their characters but assumed their relationship had not been consummated in the first season. They were not in favor of their characters getting together like <a href="HBO">HBO</a> had wanted, as "that's really not what they're about." Per Brown, the sibling relationship informs Brother Justin's and Iris's character and motives, and continued tension frightens the audience more if it is never resolved. Although Brown and Madigan wanted to leave the status of their characters' relationship as lovers open, they deliberately played their kisses more intimate and familiar than most people would consider comfortable. Several characters intervene the siblings' relationship during the show's run. The writers had planned a sexual innuendo between Iris and Tommy Dolan, a news reporter who investigates in the arson case, but <a href="Robert%20Knepper">Robert Knepper</a> (Dolan) later felt his character might just have been a pawn between Brother Justin and Iris as siblings, making Brother Justin jealous. The Crowes also regularly hire new maids, which Knauf explained as Iris lining up surrogate women to relieve Brother Justin's sexual pressure.

In reviewing the first three episodes, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" saw in "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" commented, "Brother Justin comes across as a typical whited sepulcher – if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side – and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" considered Brown's Brother Justin "delightfully unsettling as the creepy <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a> taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" thought Brown was doing "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." A season 1 DVD review by <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> saw Clancy Brown's performance as "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor with a great deal of range, and he uses all of it in this series." Referring to Brown's portrayal as "a man of God in "Carnivale"", the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" saw Brown's "eyes always betray[ing] him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time Magazine</a>'s <a href="James%20Poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a> depicted the "<a href="Boardwalk%20Empire">Boardwalk Empire</a>" character Nelson Van Alden (played by <a href="Michael%20Shannon">Michael Shannon</a>) as "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".


Samson, in earlier drafts also called Edgar Leiber or Edgar Leonhardt, is the <a href="Dwarfism">dwarf</a> co-manager of the Carnivàle. His original biography gave his background as a dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on <a href="traveling%20carnival">traveling carnival</a>s, including the Hyde & Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager until another character, Management, <a href="%23Emergence%20of%20the%20Carniv%C3%A0le">purchased the carnival</a> (to be renamed Carnivàle) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist. The beginning of the series shows Samson delegating Management's orders to the <a href="carny">carnies</a>. Samson temporarily loses his position to Lodz for a second time near the end of the first season but retains Management's trust. The death of Management in season 2 leads to Samson's secret deal with Ben to make the boy the new commander of the carnival.


Clayton "Jonesy" Jones is an ex-baseball player who suffers from a crippling knee injury. He is Samson's right-hand man, operator of the <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a>, and the leader of the <a href="roustabout">roustabout</a>s. Jonesy's original biography reveals his past as a star <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> in the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">major league</a> whose knee was injured in revenge when he refused to throw a game for the mob. Slipping to the edge of society, Jonesy joined the Carnivàle and found redemption in the eyes of young Sofie. The two became inseparable until Sofie grew into a woman, making their relationship awkward. At the beginning of the series, Jonesy is faced with Sofie avoiding his advances. While she retreats into a friendship with cootch dancer Libby Dreifuss, Jonesy finds sexual relief with Libby's mother Rita Sue. When Sofie begins to show interest in him, he breaks off his relationship with Rita Sue; however, the fact that he was sleeping with her (and that Libby knew about it) causes Sofie to break both of their hearts as pay back. After this Jonesy remains cold towards her yet finds new affection in Libby. The two eventually <a href="elope">elope</a>. Jonesy is kidnapped, tortured and left for dead by a man who had lost his wife in a Ferris wheel accident. Ben is able to heal Jonesy including his crippled knee, and Jonesy joins Ben on his last mission. In the series' final minutes, Jonesy and Sofie meet again, and she shoots him in cold blood.


Apollonia and Sofie Agnesh Bojakshiya are <a href="Fortune-telling">fortuneteller</a>s in a mother-daughter act at the carnival. Although Apollonia is <a href="catatonic">catatonic</a>, she and Sofie can communicate <a href="telepathic">telepathic</a>ally. Their original biographies declare Apollonia a "once renowned seer who read cards for the rich and famous" and "the only psychic <a href="Houdini">Houdini</a> was unable to debunk." A series of seizures during Sofie's birth in 1913 was given as reason for Apollonia's state. Apollonia's sister cared for her until Sofie was old enough to take over, and they began working the traveling circuits shortly afterwards. It remains unknown until late in season 2 that Sofie is the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Omega</a>", although the character's importance for the show's mythology is suggested much earlier. When the series starts with Ben joining the carnival, Apollonia can no longer shield Sofie from her own true self. Sofie begins to evade and rebel against her mother's mental control, but Apollonia counters by first trying to drive Sofie to suicide, then by attempting to kill her in a trailer fire at the end of the first season. Jonesy rescues Sofie, but Apollonia dies. Nevertheless, season 2 shows Apollonia repeatedly appearing to Sofie and snake charmer Ruthie. Sofie tries to leave her fortuneteller life behind by becoming a <a href="roustabout">roustabout</a>. After a short-lived relationship with Ben, Sofie leaves the carnival altogether and becomes the Crowes' maid in <a href="California">California</a>. Brother Justin introduces her to the world of religion, but several signs suggest the preacher is not the good man Sofie thought. After berating Brother Justin in the final episode, Sofie is locked in a barn where visions insinuate her as the Omega and Brother Justin as her father. She later shoots Jonesy, and her eyes have taken on the coal black appearance of Brother Justin's eyes. The final minutes of the series show Sofie finding Brother Justin dead in a cornfield. She lays her hands on his chest, and the corn around them dies.


Professor Ernst Lodz is a blind <a href="mentalist">mentalist</a>. As revealed both in the show and in his original biography, he has a <a href="%23Emergence%20of%20the%20Carniv%C3%A0le">long history with the Carnivàle</a>. Lodz's character arc starts with Ben joining the carnival. Lodz unsuccessfully hassles the boy to work with him and to listen to his dreams. He later initiates Ruthie's death with Management's blessing to get his sight back. Upon finding out these circumstances, Ben strangles Lodz to death, reviving Ruthie in the process. Nevertheless, Lodz repeatedly appears to Ruthie and leaves her the message "Sofie is the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Omega</a>"" on a mirror. Using Ruthie's body, Lodz also visits his lover Lila and informs her about the events leading to his death and "you'll be seeing me soon [...] in the flesh." Lodz's final appearance as Ruthie was not supposed to be his last. According to Clancy Brown (Brother Justin), the writers had originally planned Lodz's return as a <a href="mummy">mummy</a> after a man sold his <a href="Desiccation">desiccated</a> body to the carnies. Lodz's demise in season 1 however was planned from the beginning. Besides serving a purpose to the story, it should indicate all bets are off for the other characters.


Lila Villanueva, also known as the <a href="Bearded%20Lady">Bearded Lady</a> of <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, is the lover of Lodz and the dressmaker of the carnival. Lila's original biography states she was born into the Villanueva circus family in <a href="Terrebonne%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana</a> in 1890. The family traveled the international circuit as the "Flying Villalobos" until misfortune struck. One of Lila's two older brothers died in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in 1905, and her father committed suicide in 1908. At age sixteen, Lila already sported a beard and married for the first time. The marriage did not last long, and Lila would marry over nineteen more times in her life. Lodz would be her only <a href="Romantic%20love">true love</a>. Lila's arc of the first season is limited to being with Lodz until she notices his growing contact with Management. His sudden disappearance at the beginning of season 2 however makes her suspicious. Samson's subsequent evasive behavior suggests external forces, but Lila finds herself unable to obtain proof. Ruthie repeatedly approaches Lila at night, seemingly possessed by Lodz, and leaves her clues. When Lila finally learns of the circumstances surrounding Lodz's death, she suborns the carnival crew to a <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> that almost prevents the troupe from meeting with Brother Justin in <a href="California">California</a>.


Felix "Stumpy" Dreifuss is the manager of the cootch (<a href="striptease">striptease</a>) show. He is married to Rita Sue, and has two daughters, Libby and Dora Mae. Their original biographies state Rita Sue was born in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> in 1895 as the only child of Thomas and Emma Menninger. Her parents invested in her education at the finest Eastern boarding schools, but the family's financial fortunes declined with Thomas's death in 1903. Rita Sue left her home in 1908 and started <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> work. She joined several traveling companies and strip-shows, where she met Stumpy, a <a href="Barker%20%28occupation%29">barker</a> who had begun his career in 1910. They married in 1914, two months before the birth of their first child, Libby. In 1916, their second daughter, Dora Mae, was born. When their company's owner died, Stumpy and Rita Sue began traveling with various carnival companies and were eventually joined by their two daughters in the late 1920s. Their fortunes steadily declined in the 1930s when more cootch family acts spawned in the difficult times. The series mentions Stumpy and Rita Sue had three more children, one of whom was stillborn and two of whom died of <a href="influenza">influenza</a>. The Dreifuss family continues to face many personal and economic problems during the show's run. Dora Mae is murdered by an inhabitant of a haunted ghost town, the sexual relationships between Jonesy and Rita Sue, then Jonesy and Libby, cause much heartbreak, and Stumpy's affection for <a href="gambling">gambling</a> almost ruins the family.


Ruthie is a <a href="snake%20charmer">snake charmer</a> and <a href="Barker%20%28occupation%29">barker</a> for the <a href="strongman%20%28circus%29">strongman</a> acts of her son Gabriel. Their arc in the story reveals Ruthie as a former lover of the mysterious Henry Scudder. Gabriel, a big and powerful person but with a low <a href="intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a>, is the first <a href="carny">carny</a> to experience Ben's healing powers. Shortly after Ruthie and Ben grow close, Ruthie dies from a snake bite. Ben first tries unsuccessfully to resurrect Ruthie, but succeeds later when he strangles Lodz, the carnival's blind mentalist. In season 2, Ruthie starts to encounter people who have died a long time ago. Being possessed by Lodz at night, Ruthie repeatedly approaches Lila, leading to Lila turning into a major obstacle for the carnival's success.



Iris Crowe is the older sister of Brother Justin and a devoted supporter of his ministry duties in <a href="California">California</a>. Iris' significance in the series starts when Brother Justin informs her about the church board's plan to take away his new ministry. Shortly after, a fire in the church kills several orphans, but it remains unknown until the end of the first season that Iris was the arsonist. Radio show host Tommy Dolan, who arrived to help with the arson investigation, develops feelings for Iris, but a romance is hindered by Brother Justin's return from a week-long self-discovery trip. Dolan starts to uncover evidence pointing to Iris's guilt, but a strange twist at Iris's planned public confession results in Dolan's arrest as the culprit. To prevent the revelation of Brother Justin's true nature, Iris murders an innocent <a href="Okie">Okie</a>, Eleanor. Late in the second season, Iris joins her foster father Norman in an ultimately unsuccessful plot against Brother Justin.


Tommy Dolan is a radio show host and news reporter from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, who regularly travels incognito into the wilderness to collect strangers' stories for his show "Tommy Dolan on the Road". His first appearance in the series occurs when he meets Brother Justin around a campfire. After retelling Brother Justin's story of the burned-down ministry in his radio show, Dolan approaches Brother Justin's sister Iris and helps her with receiving funds for a new church. Dolan is seemingly attracted to Iris, but Brother Justin's return prevents further advances. By the beginning of season 2, Dolan has fulfilled Brother Justin's wish to become a radio preacher, yet police evidence surfaces first hinting at Brother Justin's, then Iris' guilt in the arson. Trying to further his career, Dolan collects evidence until Brother Justin accepts the arrangement of a special confession announcement for Iris. The confession backfires and Dolan is arrested, with Iris's guilt never proven.


Reverend Norman Balthus is Brother Justin's mentor. He rescued and raised young Justin and Iris after he had found them alone in the wilderness. Late in the first season, Norman grows suspicious of Brother Justin's inner motivations. He confronts his foster son but does not carry out Brother Justin's plea to kill him. At the beginning of season 2, Norman suffers a stroke leaving him unable to move or speak. He remains in the care of Brother Justin and Iris until the carnival sets up near Brother Justin's home at the end of the series. Ben heals Norman, but the reverend is fatally lacerated by Brother Justin seconds later.


Varlyn Stroud is a <a href="convict">convict</a>. His original biography gives insight into his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara as his first murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a> car so Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still spent most of his life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the <a href="List%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%20episodes">route of the carnival</a>. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.


Since the first episodes of "Carnivàle", Ben's parentage is one of the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up by the end of the second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after "Carnivàle"'s cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde & Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a>, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.


Henry "Hack" Scudder is a mysterious man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams wearing a <a href="tuxedo">tuxedo</a>. Scudder is mentioned several times in the first season, revealing he once worked at the carnival's <a href="geek%20show">geek show</a> and was Ruthie's lover. Scudder also had a relationship with Ben's mother once; Samson later confirms Scudder as Ben's father. Season 2 forces both Ben and Brother Justin to find Scudder for their own purposes. It is confirmed that he is the previous generation's Creature of Darkness, and just as Management, the previous Avatar of Light, knew Ben's identity, he knows Brother Justin's, the current Avatar of Darkness. He had repeatedly tried to flee from his destiny, and when he sensed Management approaching he fled to protect Ben and his mother. After a long journey, Ben finds Scudder in Damascus, Nebraska and brings him to the carnival's Management and reveals that Management's son is the Avatar of Darkness. Management attacks Scudder, leading to Ben killing Management to protect him. Scudder flees and moments later, escaped convict Stroud kidnaps him and brings him to Brother Justin. Brother Justin anticipates Scudder's renewed escape and <a href="decapitate">decapitate</a>s him.


Lucius Belyakov is a mysterious man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a <a href="Russians">Russian</a> soldier. He is also revealed to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, he is also the carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned for Ben to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Usher</a>", Ben's ultimate nemesis.

Although "Carnivàle" is set in the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have visions and dreams suggesting the story began much earlier. Samson summarizes the backstory in a monologue at the beginning of season 2, without mentioning names. The Pitch Document, which served as the source for the character biographies on the HBO website, provides context for all clues.

The carnival's backstory begins at the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a <a href="Russians">Russian</a> <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocrat</a> from <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> and officer in the <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>'s army, became aware of his <a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Avataric powers</a>. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two children to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in <a href="Battle%20of%20Lemberg%20%281914%29">Lemberg in 1914</a>, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a>. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped <a href="circus">circus</a> <a href="bear">bear</a> feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.

Scudder escaped and encountered carnival performer Lodz on the battlefield, searching for his bear Bruno. When Scudder joined Lodz's troupe, Lodz recognized and cultivated Scudder's supernatural abilities, and they started to perform in the salons of war-torn Europe. Meanwhile, Belyakov slowly recovered from his wounds and learned about his true nature and destiny through devoted study of ancient manuscripts. Scudder could feel Belyakov tracking his movements and never stayed long in one area. Growing impatient, Lodz got into a fight with Scudder about his skills and was gifted with <a href="telepathy">mindreading</a> in exchange for his sense of sight. Scudder returned to America in 1915 to flee his nightmares. Several months later, Belyakov located the broken-down Lodz in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. Belyakov noticed the mental bond between Lodz and Scudder the power transfer had caused, and promised to restore Lodz's sight if he helped in finding Scudder.

Scudder fell in love and married a local girl named Flora Hawkins from <a href="Milfay%2C%20Oklahoma">Milfay, Oklahoma</a>, with whom he had a son, Ben. When Scudder felt his pursuing enemy again, he left his family and traveled aimlessly throughout the country. After narrowly surviving a cave-in in Babylon, he joined the Hyde & Teller Company, a small carnival working the southeastern circuit. Scudder worked as a <a href="geek%20show">sideshow geek</a> for nearly a year and got to know Samson, Jonesy, Possum, Lila, Ruthie and Gabriel. Meanwhile, Belyakov used Lodz's tracking skills and purchased the Hyde & Teller Company, scantily missing Scudder. To remain undercover, Belyakov renamed the troupe "Carnivàle", assumed the name "Management", and replaced Samson with Lodz as the new co-manager. Lodz finally located Scudder in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, but when Lodz failed in preventing Scudder from going into hiding again (with the <a href="Mythology%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%23Knights%20Templar">Order Templar</a>), Samson regained his old job. Over the years, the Carnivàle took on new acts such as the <a href="Fortune-telling">fortuneteller</a>s Apollonia and Sofie, the <a href="conjoined%20twin">conjoined twin</a>s, Gecko the Lizard Man, and the Dreifuss family. While Lodz embitteredly waited for Management to fulfill his earlier promise of restoring his sight, Samson ran the show, counseled by Management and assisted by Jonesy. Eighteen years went by until Management felt Ben Hawkins, whom he had sensed as his Ascendant since birth, was old enough to be approached. At this point, the first season of "Carnivàle" resumes the story.

The pilot episode begins with Ben Hawkins waking up from a dream of a <a href="Mythology%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%23The%20Tattooed%20Man%20and%20the%20tree">tattooed man</a>, a man in a tuxedo, and a Russian soldier. Ben's childhood is revealed in flashbacks and dialogue; Ben's father had left the family's farm when Ben was an infant, leaving him in the care of Flora, Ben's mother. Late season 1 confirms what early episodes had already suggested – the man in the tuxedo, Henry Scudder, is Ben's father. In the second season, Ben meets his paternal grandmother, Emma Krohn, and learns she killed her husband Hilton Scudder on the night of Henry's birth, along with Henry's older brothers Owen, Gilbert, and Alvin Sr. (According to Knauf and the HBO website, Emma's other sons were from a previous marriage to Clarke "C.W." Powell, who had died by natural causes.) Emma introduces the people living with her as her grandchildren and Ben's cousins.

Brother Justin Crowe is introduced as a devoted Methodist minister, who is supported by his sister Iris. On a self-discovery trip in the middle of the first season, Brother Justin has an elaborate vision of two Russian immigrant children, Irina and her younger brother Alexei; Irina talks of her evil father. As revealed shortly afterwards, this vision is a repressed memory of Brother Justin of him and Iris as the only survivors of a train accident which also cost their mother's life. Reverend Norman Balthus later saved Irina and Alexei and raised them in a church orphanage. A vision prompts Brother Justin to get his chest tattooed early in the second season.

Some people of the Carnivàle are closely related. Apollonia and Sofie are introduced as mother and daughter working as fortunetellers. Sofie grew up not knowing her father, but has a vision later in the first season of the Tattooed Man raping her mother. In the season 2 opening episode, Management, the mysterious leader of the carnival, reveals himself as Lucius Belyakov, the Russian soldier of Ben's dreams. Moments before his death several episodes later, Belyakov learns that his son Alexei (Brother Justin) did not die in a train accident, as he had previously believed. In the meantime, Sofie has become the Crowes' maid. When she has a chat with Iris about her childhood, Iris has a vision of Brother Justin as a young man raping Apollonia during his seminary studies in <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>. Although Iris only informs Norman of her suspicions, Sofie sees Brother Justin's tattooed chest in the final episode of season 2 and has implicit visions insinuating Brother Justin as her father. <a href="%23Season%202%20finale%20and%20character%20fates">Future seasons of "Carnivàle"</a> would have expanded the Belyakov genealogy, making a fusion with the Scudder genealogy possible.

The <a href="Casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">casting</a> approach for "Carnivàle" was to find the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on <a href="freak%20show">freak</a> illusions too much. "Carnivàle"'s casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as <a href="Adrienne%20Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a> (Ruthie).

The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show would go afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters. <a href="Nick%20Stahl">Nick Stahl</a> had the strongest consensus among the producers to portray the leading man and hero of the series with a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic <a href="Romani%20people">gypsy</a> girl, but <a href="Clea%20DuVall">Clea DuVall</a>, a movie actress trying to become involved in regular television, got the part after four auditions. <a href="Tim%20DeKay">Tim DeKay</a>, who had previously worked with Daniel Knauf on a pilot episode of a different project, was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a "very American" looking <a href="baseball%20player">baseball player</a> of the 1930s period. <a href="Debra%20Christofferson">Debra Christofferson</a> impressed the producers with her first and only audition, playing Lila as Lodz's lover instead of his best friend as the script had implied. Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie) was cast after her first audition as well, although she had originally expected to be cast as Apollonia. She learned to snake-dance afterwards. <a href="Brian%20Turk">Brian Turk</a>'s role as Gabriel was originally intended to be a mute character described as "a mildly retarded strongman with the face of an angel", but the writers later gave Turk a speaking part to not have another mute character like Management and Apollonia. One of the only actors who never had any real competition was <a href="Michael%20J.%20Anderson">Michael J. Anderson</a> as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial casting meeting; Samson, Knauf's favorite character, was inspired by Knauf's father.

The filmed pilot episode served as basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines. The expanded role of Brother Justin encouraged the creation of his sister Iris in a supporting role, for which <a href="Amy%20Madigan">Amy Madigan</a> was cast. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (<a href="striptease">striptease</a>) Dreifuss family; a "Carnivàle" consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s. <a href="Cynthia%20Ettinger">Cynthia Ettinger</a> (Rita Sue Dreifuss) had lost her role as <a href="Martha%20Kent">Martha Kent</a> in the pilot episode of "<a href="Smallville%20%28TV%20series%29">Smallville</a>" before the opportunity for "Carnivàle" came up and had turned to theater jobs; she chose "Carnivàle" because of the theater-like experience. <a href="Amanda%20Aday">Amanda Aday</a> (Dora Mae Dreifuss) knew she would join the cast for only a few episodes, but was not told the story reasons at that point. The writers prolonged the character arcs of recurring <a href="John%20Carroll%20Lynch">John Carroll Lynch</a> (Stroud) and <a href="K%20Callan">K Callan</a> (Eleanor) considerably beyond their original intention. Similarly, <a href="Robert%20Knepper">Robert Knepper</a>'s role as Tommy Dolan was extended from a few episodes to half of both seasons because the writers had liked his performance as an "ambitious man [who uses] Brother Justin to further his career."

Genetic disorders or unusual body features are not uncommon among "Carnivàle" actors. Michael J. Anderson (Samson) has <a href="osteogenesis%20imperfecta">osteogenesis imperfecta</a>, a genetic bone disorder that leaves him at a size of 3 ft 7 (109 cm), while <a href="Matthew%20McGrory">Matthew McGrory</a> (Giant) stood at 7 ft 6 (228 cm) because of <a href="hyperpituitarism">hyperpituitarism</a>. <a href="Bree%20Walker">Bree Walker</a> (Sabina) has <a href="ectrodactyly">ectrodactyly</a>, a rare genetic disorder that results in fused fingers and toes; she approached the producers in the second season to let her play a "lobster gal". Several actors for one-time characters like the lobster gal in "<a href="List%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%20episodes%23ep10">Hot and Bothered</a>" and Percy The Praying Mantis in "<a href="List%20of%20Carniv%C3%A0le%20episodes%23Season%202%20%282005%29">The Road to Damascus</a>" were also cast for their respective real-life disabilities. <a href="Cameron%20Clapp">Cameron Clapp</a> (Management) had lost an arm and both legs in a train accident at the age of 15. <a href="Daniel%20Browning%20Smith">Daniel Browning Smith</a> (Rollo the Rubberboy) holds two <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a>s for his body-bending abilities. The actors playing the roles of the <a href="conjoined%20twins">conjoined twins</a> (<a href="Steben%20Twins">Karyne and Sarah Steben</a>, identical twins and real-life trapezists), Lila the <a href="Bearded%20Lady">Bearded Lady</a> (<a href="Debra%20Christofferson">Debra Christofferson</a>) and Gecko the Lizard Man (<a href="John%20Fleck%20%28actor%29">John Fleck</a>) are performers without genetic aberrances whose appearances were altered through makeup and prosthetics.

To give the illusion of being <a href="freak%20show">freaks</a>, the appearance of several actors was modified by make-up elements. <a href="John%20Fleck%20%28actor%29">John Fleck</a> (Gecko) spent over ten hours in makeup each day to transform into and out of his character. The skin, which needed to look like alligator hide, consisted of seven or eight separate pieces and needed to be glued to Fleck's face. <a href="Patrick%20Bauchau">Patrick Bauchau</a> (Lodz) had several contact lenses pairs of different opaqueness. While one pair enabled him to see shapes, another pair made him basically blind and he had to be led around the set. <a href="Debra%20Christofferson">Debra Christofferson</a> (Lila) had a fake beard applied to her chin; the beard was custom-made by hand-tying human hair onto lace that would disappear when the beard was glued onto the skin. The beard of the early episodes was so heavy that the chemicals caused Christofferson's skin to be raw at the end of the shooting day, and was later split into three pieces. Christofferson still needed to be careful with mouth movements. According to the actress, "the beard actually determined Lila's voice."

Establishing the characters' background rather than prettiness was the main goal of costumes. Ben wore the same clothes in both seasons, and to make them look identical, around twenty multiples of his coveralls were made by hand. It took over six weeks to apply all stitches, patches and the roughly fifty holes, plus the aging process. Brother Justin's clothes were made period-correct from the beginning, but the character's foreboding presence was enhanced by fitting his frock on the waist and making the shoulders look bigger than usual for that time period. Sofie's clothes had a strong <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n Eastern influence to portray her mother's origin and sensibilities. Stumpy's wardrobe consisted of <a href="baggy%20pants">baggy pants</a> and an Italian <a href="bowler%20hat">bowler hat</a> that gave him a 1920s look instead of the 1930s, showing his clothes were <a href="second-hand">second-hand</a>. The stripper clothes of Rita Sue and Libby were influenced by <a href="Mae%20West">Mae West</a>, <a href="harlot">harlot</a> movies and silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, with additional research put into Asian harlots, <a href="Latin%20dance">Latin dance</a>rs and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>an dancers. The costume designers chose the costumes of the Daily Brothers Show, a rival carnival, to have a new color tone to set them apart from the Carnivàle. The dress of Sabina the Scorpion Lady underwent several die-bleaching cycles to achieve a red-orange-purple color that would work well when filming outside. Bert/Bertha's costume was made in a hurry from a vintage tuxedo and an old feathered dress, which helped to give it a "made-it-on-the-road" feeling.

In 2004, "Carnivàle" won a Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award and two <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a>s in the categories "Outstanding Costumes for a Series" and "Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series". The show was also nominated in the Emmy category "Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Non-Prosthetic)" both in 2004 and 2005, and in the categories "Outstanding Costumes for a Series", "Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series", and "Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special" in 2005. In the same year, "Carnivàle" was nominated for two <a href="Costume%20Designers%20Guild%20Awards%202005">Costume Designers Guild Award</a>s in the categories "Outstanding Costume Design for Television Series – Period/Fantasy" and "Excellence in Costume Design for Television – Period/Fantasy", winning the latter.

As early reviews focused on Ben Hawkins, Brother Justin Crowe and the meaning of "Carnivàle", the show's supporting characters received little to no attention other than having their <a href="freak%20show">freak appearances</a> mentioned, according to "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Phil Gallo because "they don't play significant parts in the first few episodes." Critics who reviewed full seasons gave more credit. Wendy Tuohy of the Australian newspaper "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" stated that show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a> "sprinkled enough magical gifts over the carnival's cast of mind readers, fortunetellers, snake charmers, catatonic psychics, conjoined twins, bearded ladies and lizard men to make the bizarre and the macabre appear just about routine." Matt Casamassina of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> added that "from the opening sequence to the fade out on episode 12 [of season 1], "Carnivàle" successfully draws you into the Depression-engulfed world of its many oddly likeable characters. And sure enough, odd best describes these people [...] The show prominently features all manners of freaks, but each is well-crafted, layered, and believable, rather than comical, as easily could have been the case under amateur direction." <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> acknowledged the characters "speak[ing] in a dialogue that feels authentic, even if that authenticity is a modern interpretation [...] Carnivàle manager Samson, <a href="Michael%20J.%20Anderson">Michael J. Anderson</a> gets the best dialogue, dropping terrifically incomprehensible lines." <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> lauded <a href="Amy%20Madigan">Amy Madigan</a> (Iris), <a href="Tim%20DeKay">Tim DeKay</a> (Jonesy), and <a href="Clea%20DuVall">Clea DuVall</a> (Sofie) as "fantastic choices" with particularly convincing 1930s looks. They highlighted "Carnivàle"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> status as an ensemble show, with "the performances of all the supporting characters [being] essential to the show's success. Particularly inspired is the voice of <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a> as the decidedly creepy 'Management' and <a href="John%20Savage%20%28actor%29">John Savage</a> as Henry Scudder." A DVDTown review further praised the supporting performances of <a href="Patrick%20Bauchau">Patrick Bauchau</a> (Lodz) and Michael J. Anderson (Samson), pointing out that "in fact, every single character on the show, no matter how small, quirky or sinister they are, produce noteworthy performances all round. It is through the efforts of this outstanding cast that makes the entire premise of the show and the period setting so realistic and believable that the audience can't help but get immersed in it."

Several supporting actors received award recognition for their performances in "Carnivàle". <a href="Adrienne%20Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a> (Ruthie) was nominated for a 2003 <a href="Golden%20Satellite%20Award">Golden Satellite Award</a> in the category "Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Drama", and won a 2004 WIN Award in the category "Best Actress in a Dramatic Series". Amy Madigan (Iris) was nominated for a 2003 <a href="Golden%20Satellite%20Award">Golden Satellite Award</a> in the category "Best Performance by an Actress in a Series, Drama". <a href="Erin%20Sanders">Erin Sanders</a> (young Iris) was nominated for a 2004 <a href="Young%20Artist%20Award">Young Artist Award</a> in the category "Best Performance in a TV Series – Recurring Young Actress".

While <a href="HBO">HBO</a> entertainment president Carolyn Strauss felt "Carnivàle" had come to a natural end with its second season and gave this as the network's explanation for not renewing "Carnivàle", it was reported HBO president <a href="Chris%20Albrecht">Chris Albrecht</a> had originally wanted to conclude the second season of "Carnivàle" with a satisfying and close-ended confrontation between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, but show creator <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a> stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene in the writing phase, budgeting the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel "Carnivàle" prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement. However, <a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a> (Brother Justin) remembers the original last shot of the series as Iris watching the corn die, not of Ben in Management's trailer.

Following the cancellation, the writers did not immediately answer fan questions about the characters' future, arguing the story ideas should not be revealed just for instant fan gratification and should wait to be told until the opportunity arises. They later provided clues in DVD special features and at conventions, in forums and in online chats. Tim DeKay mentioned that the third season would have opened five years after the events of the second season finale. Daniel Knauf said Jonesy would have recovered from his gunshot wound, having been saved by Iris. Producer <a href="Howard%20Klein%20%28television%20producer%29">Howard Klein</a> however pointed out that Jonesy "wasn't shot in a specific place – he [just] collapsed", and Knauf added "Sofie's intent in shooting Jonesy was to stop him from taking her back to the carnival", not to kill him. Season 3 would have opened with Jonesy pitching in a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> game and still being married to Libby, as well as having a son with her.

Writer and co-executive producer <a href="William%20Schmidt%20%28TV%20writer%29">William Schmidt</a> described Sofie's last seen action as "raising her father at the end, bringing him back to life." This was "to indicate that she was truly evil", although "she is the "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Omega</a>" so there's good in her too." The third season "would have been pretty much centered on Sofie and the internal struggle of her <a href="good%20and%20evil">good versus evil</a>." The nature of the Omega would have taken two seasons to unfold.

Both Ben and Brother Justin would have been alive in the third season. Daniel Knauf would have written Brother Justin as a man "with an inoperable chunk of <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> near his heart", which the <a href="Anointing">anointed</a> blade had caused in the final season 2 episode. Brother Justin would have been "severely weakened and prone to exhaustion, serving as a hollow figurehead in his burgeoning ministry. Sofie and Iris would be vying for the power behind the throne, with Sofie by far the more dangerous of the two, although Iris is a force to be reckoned with." Knauf had the intention of marrying Brother Justin to Sofie at some point in the future, and the third season would have shown a three-year-old boy amidst Sofie and the Crowes. Knauf left the question about the child's parents open. Ben's future would face other hardships. According to Knauf, Ben's wounds of the season 2 finale would require repeated suturing, causing him to lose his "<a href="Avatars%20%28Carniv%C3%A0le%29">Vitae Divina</a>" and draining him of strength. Ben would be a different man than he was before, with a personality closer to Management, and while he and Sofie would be bound together by love, their ultimate fates remain uncertain.

Government of the Han dynasty

The <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> (202 BC – 220 AD) of <a href="History%20of%20China">ancient China</a> was the second <a href="Dynasties%20in%20Chinese%20history">imperial dynasty of China</a>, following the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (221–206 BC). It was divided into the periods of Former Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and Later Han (25–220 AD), briefly interrupted by the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD) of <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a>. The capital of Western Han was <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>, and the capital of Eastern Han was <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>. The <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">emperor</a> headed the government, <a href="Promulgation">promulgating</a> all written laws, serving as <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20China%20%28pre-1911%29">armed forces</a>, and presiding as the chief executive official. He appointed all government officials who earned a salary of 600 <a href="bushel">bushel</a>s of grain or more (though these salaries were largely paid in <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">coin cash</a>) with the help of advisors who reviewed each nominee. The <a href="empress%20dowager">empress dowager</a> could either be the emperor's actual or symbolic mother, and was in practice more powerful than the emperor, as she could override his decisions. The emperor's executive powers could also be practiced by any official upon whom he bestowed the Staff of Authority. These powers included the right to execute criminals without the imperial court's permission.

Near the beginning of the dynasty, <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">semi-autonomous regional kings</a> rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the <a href="Rebellion%20of%20the%20Seven%20States">Rebellion of the Seven States</a>. The <a href="End%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">End of the Han dynasty</a> came about during a time of civil, military and religious upheaval, which resulted in the period of <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a>.

The highest officials in the central bureaucracy, who provided advisory, censorial, executive, and judicial roles in governing the empire, consisted of <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> members known as <a href="Three%20Excellencies">the Excellencies</a>, heads of large specialized ministries known as the <a href="Nine%20Ministers">Nine Ministers</a>, and various metropolitan officials of the capital region. Distinguished salary-ranks were granted to officials in the bureaucracy, nobles of the imperial family, concubines of the harem, and military officers of the armed forces.

Local government divisions, in descending order by size, were the <a href="Zhou%20%28country%20subdivision%29">province</a>, <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commandery</a>, <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23History">county</a>, and <a href="District%20%28China%29">district</a>. Local <a href="fief">fief</a>s of <a href="Chinese%20nobility">the nobility</a> included the kingdom, which was modeled largely upon the regular commandery, as well as the <a href="marquess">marquess</a>ate, modelled largely upon the regular county. Although the central government's monopolies on salt, iron, and liquor eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a>, which lasted from 113 BC until the <a href="End%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">end of the dynasty</a>. The <a href="conscription">conscription</a> system for commoners as non-professional soldiers was reduced in size in favor of a <a href="volunteer%20army">volunteer army</a> and a substitution tax by Eastern Han. A small professional <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> existed throughout Western and Eastern Han. During times of crisis, the volunteer army increased in size, but large <a href="militia">militia</a>s were raised and certain officer titles were revived for temporary use.

During the Han dynasty, the power a government official exercised was determined by his annual salary-rank, measured in grain units known as "dan" (, a unit of volume, approximately ). However, approximately half an official's salary in grain was made in payments of <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">cash coins</a>, the standard of which, after 119 BC, was the "wushu" (五銖) coin measuring 3.2 g (0.11 oz). The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked grain and <a href="husk">husk</a>ed grain measured in "hu" (觳, approximately 20 L / 676 <a href="Fluid%20ounce">oz</a>); since one "hu" of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one "hu" of husked grain was equal to 160 coins, the conversion ratio for unhusked grain to husked grain was 10 to 6 (see table below). <a href="Three%20Excellencies">The most senior officials</a> in central government earned a 10,000-"dan" salary. The officials who oversaw <a href="Nine%20Ministers">nine specialized ministries</a> each earned the Fully 2,000-"dan" rank, while the <a href="County%20magistrate%20%28China%29">magistrate</a> of a <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> earned a 600-"dan" rank. Occasionally, emperors bestowed luxurious gifts of wine, foodstuffs, and <a href="History%20of%20silk">silk clothes</a> upon high officials. These gifts, in some generous cases, could equal as much as half the value of the officials' standard annual salary. Aged officials were often retired from service and given a pension. Below is a table outlining salaries measured in coin cash, unhusked grain, and husked grain for the highest to lowest-paid officials in Han officialdom:

<a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>, the first ruler of the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a>, established China's imperial system of government in 221 BC after unifying the <a href="Seven%20Warring%20States">Seven Warring States</a> through conquest, bringing to an end the <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a>. For a time, the rulers of the warring states claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a> (c. 1050 – 256 BC), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was less than that of later Chinese emperors. The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BC. However, following <a href="Chu-Han%20contention">Han's victory over Chu</a>, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as <a href="Emperor%20Gaozu%20of%20Han">Emperor Gaozu</a> (r. 202–195 BC).

The Han system of imperial government borrowed many of its core features from the regime established by the Qin dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor <a href="Xiao%20He">Xiao He</a> (d. 193 BC) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly compiled Han law code. Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over only a third of the empire—the other two-thirds of territory was controlled by semi-autonomous kingdoms—strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China. However, a series of reforms eventually stripped away any vestiges of the kingdoms' independence. Han emperors thereafter enjoyed full and direct control over China, as had the first Qin emperor. The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard <a href="Ancient%20Chinese%20coinage">currency</a>, the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins. In 113 BC the Han court finally established the central government's monopoly control over the issuance of a standard, nationwide currency.

The emperor, who enjoyed paramount social status, was the head of the government administration. His rule was virtually <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolute</a>, although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions. Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The emperor had the sole right to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-"dan" or higher. The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government. Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, or student graduates of the <a href="Taixue">Imperial University</a>. This institution was established in 124 BC, and provided a <a href="Confucianism">Confucian</a>-based education for those entering <a href="civil%20service">civil service</a>.
The emperor had the exclusive right to modify the <a href="Code%20%28law%29">law code</a> and issue new laws in the form of imperial edicts ("zhao" 詔) and decrees ("ling" 令). However, he often accepted the decisions and reforms suggested by his chief judicial minister, the Commandant of Justice. The emperor also acted as the supreme judge. Any lawsuits which a county administration, then commandery administration, and then Minister of Justice could not resolve were deferred to the emperor.

The emperor's role as supreme judge could be temporarily duplicated by any official he designated in times of emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority ("Jiezhang" 節杖). Roughly 2 m (6 ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as acting on behalf of the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.

During the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a>, the first Qin emperor's legitimacy to rule was ultimately decided by his ability to conquer others. However, by the time of <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a>'s (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Mandate of Heaven</a> was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of <a href="Tian">Heaven</a> over that of the <a href="Three%20Sovereigns%20and%20Five%20Emperors">Five Powers</a> in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar <a href="Dong%20Zhongshu">Dong Zhongshu</a> (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater <a href="Cosmology">cosmological</a> cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu's</a> (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.

Although the emperor held supreme power, he more often sought the advice of his cabinet and other ministers before making decisions and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences ("tingyi" 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the <a href="Consensus%20decision-making">majority consensus</a> of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.

When the emperor died without officially appointing a successor, his widow, the <a href="empress%20dowager">empress dowager</a>, had the sole right to appoint one of the late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also had the right to override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the <a href="consort%20clan">consort clan</a>— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a>.

The post of Grand Tutor ("Taifu" 太傅), although given the highest civil status below the emperor, was not regularly occupied. The role was considered an honorary rather than substantive office. In Western Han, a Grand Tutor was supposedly appointed at the beginning of each emperor's reign, and was not replaced until that emperor's death. However, only four Grand Tutors were appointed between 202 BC – 6 AD. In contrast, during Eastern Han, a new Grand Tutor was appointed when every emperor except <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan of Han</a> (r. 146–168 AD) had a Grand Tutor installed at the beginning of their reigns. The Grand Tutor's salary-rank was unspecified in literary sources, although it was likely higher than the 10,000-"dan" rank. The Grand Tutor was nominally in charge of providing a young emperor with moral guidance, but it is doubtful that this role was ever taken seriously or formally conducted. The post often served to deliberately block someone from obtaining a more important post, such as one of the Excellencies, while Grand Tutors were usually elder statesmen chosen for their age rather than merits (so they would die off quickly after being appointed).

The Excellencies ("gong", literally translated as "<a href="Chinese%20nobility">dukes</a>") were the foremost officials in central government who formed <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">the cabinet</a> during both Western and Eastern Han. For most of Western Han, the Excellencies were the Chancellor ("Chengxiang" 丞相), the Imperial Counselor ("Yushi dafu" 御史大夫), and the Grand Commandant ("Taiwei" 太尉). The Great Commandant's post was irregularly filled, and it was retitled to Grand Marshal ("Da sima" 大司馬) in 119 BC. In 8 BC, the post of Imperial Counselor was abolished in favor of a Grand Excellency of Works ("da sikong" 大司空), and by 1 BC the Chancellor's post was abolished and replaced by the Grand Excellency Over the Masses ("da situ" 大司徒). On 8 June, 51 AD the prefix "Grand" (大) was removed from the titles of the Excellency over the Masses and Excellency of Works, while the Grand Marshal was reinstated with the original title of Grand Commandant, and would remain so for the rest of Eastern Han. The exact salary figures for the Excellencies before 8 BC are unknown, although from that year forward they were given a 10,000-"dan" salary-rank, in addition to periodic gifts which further boosted their incomes.

During Western Han, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20China">Chancellor</a> was the chief civil official. The duties of the chancellery were divided between a Right Chancellor (右丞相) and Left Chancellor (左丞相) between 196 and 180 BC. After 180 BC, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority. The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, <a href="History%20of%20cartography">maps of the empire's territories</a>, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the <a href="government%20budget">government budget</a>. The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-"dan" or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The Chancellor was held responsible for the actions of officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.

Whenever the emperor was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he relied on the chancellor to direct it and inform him of the resulting majority opinion. If the attending ministers were split into opposing factions of roughly equal size, the chancellor would listen to the positions of both sides and count the exact number of ministers who supported either opposing opinion.

The Palace Writers ("Zhongshu" 中書) were originally palace <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a> secretaries ("Zhongshu guan" 中書官) from Emperor Wu's reign until 29 BC, when they were staffed by regular officials. They usurped much of the Chancellor's powers by the end of the Western Han. The position of Chancellor was abolished for much of Eastern Han and replaced by the Excellency over the Masses. However, in 208 AD the Excellency of Works <a href="Cao%20Cao">Cao Cao</a> (155–220 AD) assumed the revived post of Chancellor while acting as the "de facto" ruler over the court of <a href="Emperor%20Xian%20of%20Han">Emperor Xian</a> (r. 189–220 AD). Cao Cao also abolished the Grand Commandant and Excellency of Works while reinstating the Imperial Counselor.

During Western Han the Imperial Counselor, also known as the Grandee Secretary and Imperial Secretary, was considered the second-ranking official below the Chancellor. Like the Chancellor, he exercised censorial powers over provincial officials who also sent him annual reports. His primary duty was to uphold disciplinary procedures for officials; he could investigate even those attached to the chancellery and the imperial palace. Since one of his main functions was to prevent abuse of authority, his jurisdiction over officialdom tended to overlap with that of the Chancellor's. His subordinates included the Imperial Clerks ("Shiyushi" 侍御史; also known as Attending Secretaries), led by the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk ("Yushi zhongcheng" 御史中丞; also known as the Palace Assistant Secretary). They were often sent out into the provinces to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of local officials.

The Imperial Counselor transmitted and received imperial edicts to and from the chancellery and also presented officials' <a href="memorials%20to%20the%20throne">memorials to the throne</a>. During Western Han, the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's office was located within the walls of the palace. He had the authority to investigate attendants and eunuchs of the palace and to reject improperly written memorials before submission to the Imperial Counselor. The Masters of Writing under the Minister Steward then processed these memorials before they were sent to the throne. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's proximity to the emperor during Eastern Han allowed him to surpass the authority of his nominal superior, the Excellency of Works, yet his Western-Han-era power to inspect local provincial authorities was removed. The Minister Steward—who was supervised by the Imperial Counselor (and later Excellency of Works)—became the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's new superior by early Eastern Han. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk also managed the Imperial Library in both Western and Eastern Han, this duty being transferred to a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies in 159 AD.

The Grand Commandant (also known as the Commander-in-Chief) was the head commander of the military in Western Han, yet his office was irregularly filled (from 205–202 BC, from 196–195 BC, from 189–177 BC, from 154–150 BC, and in 140 BC). After 119 BC, the generals <a href="Huo%20Qubing">Huo Qubing</a> (d. 117 BC) and <a href="Wei%20Qing">Wei Qing</a> (d. 106 BC) simultaneously held the title until their deaths, but when the post was revived in 87 BC it became politicized when conferred as a <a href="regent">regent</a>'s title for <a href="Huo%20Guang">Huo Guang</a> (d. 68 BC). The regent was thus considered one of the Three Excellencies, although he was not technically part of the cabinet.
The Grand Commandant's office witnessed significant changes during the Eastern Han. Wang Mang separated the regent's role from the Grand Commandant's post during the <a href="Xin%20dynasty">Xin dynasty</a> (9–23 AD), since he did not want an active regent for his regime. This was retained by Eastern Han, while the third Grand Commandant of Eastern Han appointed in 51 AD transformed his ministry into a primarily civilian one. Although the Eastern-Han Grand Commandant shared the same salary-rank as the other two Excellencies who were nominally considered his equals, he was nonetheless given "de facto" privilege as the most senior civil official. However, his censorial jurisdiction now overlapped with the other two Excellencies (i.e. he was able to investigate the same officials in central and local government), who shared an advisory role to the emperor (policy suggestions could be submitted independently or jointly by all three cabinet members). His various bureaus handled appointment, promotion, and demotion of officials, population registers and agriculture, the upkeep of transportation facilities, <a href="post%20office">post office</a>s, and <a href="courier">courier</a>s, civil law cases, granary storage, and military affairs. He was also given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of Ceremonies, Minister of the Household, and Minister of the Guards.

The Excellency over the Masses (also known as the Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and advisory roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant. Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, he must have been responsible for drawing up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to mention this point. Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry. The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were nearly identical to that of the new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.

The Excellency of Works, also known as the Minister of Works, was less powerful than his previous counterpart, the Imperial Counselor. This official's advisory and censorial responsibilities coincided with those of two other Excellencies, forming a tripartite cabinet arrangement. Unlike the abolished Imperial Counselor, he was given the specialized role of overseeing public works projects throughout the empire. The Excellency of Works was responsible for the construction of <a href="Chinese%20city%20wall">city walls</a>, towns, canals, <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> ditches, dykes and dams, and other structural engineering projects. The Court Architect supervised only imperial building projects. The Excellency of Works made annual reports to the throne about the progress of local administrations' conduct of construction projects. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan, Minister of Finance, and Minister Steward.

The Nine Ministers, who were supervised by the Three Excellencies but not direct subordinates of the cabinet, each headed a specialized government ministry and held a salary-rank of Fully 2,000-"dan". Along with the tripartite cabinet members, these ministers usually attended court conferences.

The Minister of Ceremonies ("Taichang" 太常) also known as Grand Master of Ceremonies, was the chief official in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers, and the maintenance of <a href="Ancestor%20worship">ancestral temples and altars</a>. The role's title was changed to Upholder of Ceremonies ("Fengchang" 奉常) from 195 to 144 BC before reverting to the original title. Although his main concern was to link the emperor with the supernatural world and <a href="Tian">Heaven</a>, he was also given the task of setting educational standards for the <a href="Taixue">Imperial University</a> (est. 124 BC) and the academic chairs ("boshi" 博士) who specialized in the <a href="Five%20Classics">Five Classics</a>, the canon of <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>.

One of the Minister of Ceremonies' many subordinates was the Court Astronomer ("Taishi ling" 太史令; also known as the Prefect Grand Astrologer), who made <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">astronomical observations</a> and drafted the annual <a href="Chinese%20calendar">lunisolar calendar</a>. The Court Astronomer also upheld a <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a> of 9,000 <a href="Chinese%20characters">characters</a> for nominees aspiring to become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk. These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators. Other subordinates of the Minister of Ceremonies reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial offerings of food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing that accompanied ceremonies.

The Minister of the Household ("Guangluxun" 光祿勳), also known as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was originally titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace ("Lang zhongling" 郎中令) before 104 BC. He was responsible for the emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and <a href="harem">harem</a>. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as <a href="Xiaolian">Filial and Incorrupt</a>, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors ("Yi Lang" <a href="wikt%3A%E8%AD%B0%E9%83%8E">議郎</a>/议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios ("Yezhe" 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios ("Yezhe puye" 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and <a href="Ethnic%20minorities%20in%20China">non-Han-Chinese peoples</a> along the borders.

The Minister of the Guards ("Weiwei" 衛尉) was also known as Commandant of the Guards), and briefly as the Prefect of the Palace Grandees ("Zhong da fuling" 中大夫令) during <a href="Emperor%20Jing%20of%20Han">Emperor Jing of Han</a>'s reign (r. 157–141 BC) before reverting to the original title. This Minister was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The duties of his ministry were carried out by <a href="prefect">prefect</a>s, one of whom controlled the gates where nominees for office were received and officials sent memorials to the throne. To control and monitor the flow of traffic through the palace gates, the prefects used a complex passport system involving wooden and metal tallies. During an emergency, the tallies were collected and no-one was allowed to enter unless they breached the gates by force. The guards were <a href="Conscription">conscripted</a> peasants who served for a year's term as soldiers and were invited to attend a celebratory feast hosted by the emperor before demobilization.

The Minister Coachman ("Taipu" 太僕), also known as the Grand Coachman, was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coachhouses for the emperor and his palace attendants, and for the supply of <a href="Horses%20in%20East%20Asian%20warfare">horses for the armed forces</a>. His latter duty entailed the supervising of large breeding grounds of frontier pastures, tended by tens of thousands of <a href="Society%20and%20culture%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Slaves">government slaves</a>. By the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu of Han</a> (r. 141–87 BC) these contained 300,000 warhorses intended for use in <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">campaigns against the nomadic Xiongnu Confederation</a>. Some of the Minister Coachman's subordinates managed stables outside the capital city. These stables housed <a href="Ferghana%20horse">Ferghana horse</a>s that were imported or gathered as tribute from <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>n countries.

In Eastern Han—possibly due to the Coachman's influence over the transport of arms—a prefect in charge of manufacturing bows, <a href="History%20of%20crossbows">crossbows</a>, swords, and armor for the military was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry to that of the Minister Coachman.

The Minister of Justice ("Tingwei" 廷尉), also known as the Commandant of Justice, and was known as the Grand Judge ("Dali" 大理) between 144 BC and 137 BC and again between 1 BC and c. 25 AD. He was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and <a href="Original%20intent">interpreting the law</a>. Only the emperor, in his role as judge, was superior to this minister. The Minister of Justice was the supreme civil-appointed judge for cases deferred to the capital from provincial lawsuits. His judicial powers, however, were similar to those of the Chancellor. He could recommend changes to the <a href="Code%20%28law%29">law code</a> and the granting of general amnesties to those charged with crimes. His ministry was responsible for maintaining the Imperial Prison, where trials were conducted, and carrying out <a href="capital%20punishment">executions</a>. It is unknown whether he oversaw all of the twenty-six prisons in Western Han Chang'an, which were built to house convicted ex-officials. However, during Eastern Han, the Imperial Prison in Luoyang was the only prison managed by the Minister of Justice.

The Minister Herald ("Dahonglu" 大鴻臚) was also known as the Grand Herald; he was also called the Director of Guests ("Dianke" 典客) between 202 BC and 144 BC and Prefect Grand Usher ("Daxingling" 大行令) between 144 BC and 104 BC. He was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests, such as nobles and <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Imperial%20China">foreign ambassadors</a>, at the imperial court. Alongside the Minister of the Imperial Clan, his ministry oversaw the inheritance of titles and fiefs by condoling on behalf of the emperor at kings' funerals and memorializing the <a href="posthumous%20name">posthumous name</a>s of kings and marquises. The Minister Herald's office received the annual reports from the commanderies and kingdoms when they arrived in the capital <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">at the beginning of the year</a>, before passing them on to the Excellencies. His subordinates acted as seating guides and ushers for officials, nobles, and foreign delegates at imperial ceremonies and sacrifices. One of his subordinates maintained living quarters for officials in the commanderies and kingdoms who were traveling to the capital. While the Minister Herald had always conducted the formal reception of foreign envoys and enlisted the aid of interpreters, his powers in matters of foreign affairs were expanded further when the post of Director of Dependent States was abolished in 28 BC. However, by Eastern Han his duties involving the affairs of Dependent States were transferred to local administrations along the borders.

While eight of the Nine Ministers could be of commoner origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan ("Zongzheng" 宗正), also known as the Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied by a member of the imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.

The Minister of Finance ("Da sinong" 大司農) was also called the Grand Minister of Agriculture, and before 144 BC, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain ("Zhisu neishi" 治粟內史). This minister was the central government's <a href="treasurer">treasurer</a> for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He was in charge of storing the <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll taxes</a>, which were gathered in coin cash, and <a href="land%20tax">land tax</a>, which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for <a href="units%20of%20measurement">units of measurement</a>. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.

During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's powers were limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being responsible for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as <a href="Emperor%20Ling%20of%20Han">Ling</a> (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty%23Private%20manufacture%20and%20government%20monopolies">monopolized salt and iron agencies</a>, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over <a href="Chinese%20alcoholic%20beverages">liquor</a> from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">imperial mint</a> for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint was transferred to the office of the Minister of Finance.

The Minister Steward ("Shaofu" 少府), also known as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">medicine and physical care</a>, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing <a href="concubine">concubine</a>s. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing ("Shangshu ling" 尚書令). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted <a href="memorials%20to%20the%20throne">memorials to the throne</a>, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.

The Minister Steward had many subordinates, including the Court Physician ("Taiyi ling" 太醫令), also known as the Prefect Grand Physician, who checked the emperor's health every morning and accompanied him on imperial hunting trips. The Court Provisioner ("Taiguan ling" 太官令), also known as the Prefect Grand Provisioner, was responsible for managing the kitchen, its cooks, and supplying food for the emperor. Other subordinates managed the weaving houses which supplied the clothes for the emperor, the workshops which produced wares, utensils, and funerary items for the emperor, and the imperial parks and gardens where the emperor could hunt and attend outings. The Bureau of Music ("Yuefu" 樂府) was overseen by the Minister Steward and was in charge of musical performances at imperial ceremonies and entertaining the emperor with folk songs gathered from throughout the empire; it was disbanded in 7 BC and its musicians transferred to the Minister of Ceremonies.

When a <a href="Liu">Liu</a>-family relative of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>, he was provided living quarters within the palace and a personal staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–"dan") and Junior Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–"dan"), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-"dan"). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-"dan"; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-"dan". The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the heir apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the Heir Apparent. If he reached adulthood, the heir apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.

The <a href="empress">empress</a>, the legal wife of the emperor, also had an area of the palace separate from that of the emperor's private apartments, where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor. Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties. She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-"dan"), and many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, who took care of domestic needs. The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked below her in fourteen grades by the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Yuan%20of%20Han">Emperor Yuan of Han</a> (r. 49–33). However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts. The chief concubine of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, shared the same salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the concubine ranked just below her, the Favorite Beauty, shared the same salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.

The <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a>s of both Western Han <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a> and Eastern Han <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a> were governed and secured by several officials and officers. The county and municipal divisions of the capital cities were governed by a Prefect ("Ling" 令). The Prefect was also responsible for a prison and could arrest officials of high rank. The Colonel of the City Gates ("Chengmen xiaowei" 城門校衛) commanded the garrisons at the twelve city gates, each guarded by a captain, in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang.

The Bearer of the Mace ("Zhi jinwu" 執金吾) was also known as the Bearer of the Gilded Mace. This official, whose title had been Commandant of the Capital ("Zhongwei" 中尉) before 104 BC, maintained law and order in the capital city—excluding the imperial palaces—in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang. During Western Han, his salary-rank was Fully 2,000-"dan", thus his prestige was similar to that of the Nine Ministers. However, during Eastern Han his salary-rank was reduced from Fully 2,000-"dan" to Equivalent to 2,000-"dan".

While his subordinates were on constant patrol, the Bearer of the Mace personally inspected the city three times each month. He was responsible for the military <a href="arsenal">arsenal</a> as well as disaster relief efforts during floods and fires. The Bearer of the Mace had a large staff of subordinates during Western Han, whose posts were abolished or transferred elsewhere during Eastern Han. This included the abolition of the Captains of the Standard Bearers, and the emperor's entourage became responsible for clearing the roadways when the emperor left the palace and hoisting colored standards to signal his return.

The Court Architect ("Jiangzuo dajiang" 將作大匠) was in charge of the construction, maintenance, and repair of imperial palace halls, government halls, temples, grave tumuli, buildings in funerary parks, roads leading out of the capital, and <a href="flood%20control">flood control</a> works. His salary-rank was 2,000-"dan". He directed the efforts of conscripted <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> laborers until this duty was transferred to the ministry of the newly created Excellency of Works in 8 BC. The Court Architect's subordinates were responsible for gathering timber for carpenters and stone for masons. Although his office existed at the establishment of Eastern Han, it was abolished in 57 AD and his duties were transferred to an Internuncio in the Ministry of the Household. However, the post was reinstated in 76 AD with the original salary-rank, yet many of his subordinates remained abolished. Since most buildings were constructed from wood, with ceramic roof tiles, a large workforce was needed to maintain buildings that fell into disrepair. The restoration of the Imperial University during <a href="Emperor%20Shun%20of%20Han">Emperor Shun's</a> (r. 125–144 AD) reign required 100,000 laborers to work for a year under the supervision of the Court Architect.

The Colonel Director of Retainers ("Sili xiaowei" 司隸校尉), also known as Colonel of Censure and Colonel Director of Convict-Laborers, was originally called the Director of Retainers ("Sili" 司隸). His task was to supervise 1,200 convicts in their construction of roads and canals. In 91 BC, an unsuccessful five-day rebellion in Chang'an was instigated by Crown Prince <a href="Liu%20Ju">Liu Ju</a> (d. 91 BC) and his mother <a href="Empress%20Wei%20Zifu">Empress Wei Zifu</a> (d. 91 BC), who had been accused of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> and <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>. For this event, Emperor Wu prefixed "colonel" to the Director of Retainers' title in 89 BC, promoting him to the salary-rank 2,000-"dan", and granted him the Staff of Authority, allowing him to arrest and punish those allegedly practicing witchcraft.
Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers retained his privileged possession of the Staff of Authority and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff of Authority made him more powerful than the latter. The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, the Staff of Authority was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without the Staff of Authority, with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–"dan" to Equivalent to 2000–"dan".

The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks ("Shuiheng duwei" 水衡都尉) was also known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways and Parks, and was once a subordinate of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers. His salary-rank was equivalent to 2000–"dan". The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches of fruit and vegetable gardens, which, along with <a href="Game%20%28food%29">game meat</a>, provided food for the emperor's household. He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances. One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted criminals in their care of the park's <a href="hunting%20dog">hunting dog</a>s.

In 115 BC the central government's <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a> was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks. In 113 BC the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had previously been outlawed in 144 BC. The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the sole right to issue coinage throughout the empire. However, <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Emperor Guangwu of Han</a> (r. 25–57 AD) abolished the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became the responsibility of the Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.

The Director of Dependent States ("Dian shuguo" 典屬國), whose salary-rank was 2,000-"dan", was responsible for embassies to foreign countries and nomadic peoples along Han's borders and the annual exchange of hostages—usually foreign princes—submitted to the Han court. Dependent States ("Shuguo" 屬國) were first established in 121 BC and composed mostly non-Han-Chinese nomadic tribes and confederations who surrendered after negotiation or armed conflict and accepted Han <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>. They served as a buffer between Han territory and hostile tribes, such as the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a>, and as a means to quell tribes in the <a href="Ordos%20Desert">Ordos Desert</a>. The Han court appointed a Commandant ("Duwei" 都尉), also known as Chief Commandant, ranked Equivalent to 2,000-"dan", to govern the non-Han-Chinese populations of each Dependent State. The Director of Dependent States' title was abolished in 28 BC; his duties and his subordinates, the Commandants, became the responsibilities of the Minister Herald. The <a href="Protectorate%20of%20the%20Western%20Regions">Protectorate of the Western Regions</a>, established in 60 BC, which conducted foreign affairs with the oasis city-states in the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, was not the responsibility of the Director of Dependent States.

The Han Empire was divided by hierarchical political divisions in the following descending order: <a href="Zhou%20%28country%20subdivision%29">provinces</a> ("zhou"), <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commanderies</a> ("jun"), and <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%23History">counties</a> ("xian"). This model of local government was adopted from the previous government structure of the Qin dynasty.

A Han province consisted of a group of commanderies, the administrations of which were subject to scrutiny and inspection by centrally appointed officials. These were the Inspectors ("Cishi" 刺史), also known as the Circuit Inspector, who were first appointed in 106 BC at a salary-rank of 600-"dan". In Western Han they were supervised by the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and were subordinates of the Imperial Counselor. Aside from the province-sized capital region, known as <a href="Sili%20Province">Sili Province</a>, which was entrusted to the Colonel Director of Retainers from 89–9 BC, there were thirteen provinces during Western Han. Eventually, the title of Inspector was changed to Governor ("Mu" 牧; literally "Shepherd"), a post with a considerably higher salary-rank of 2,000-"dan". From 5–1 BC, this post was reverted to Inspector, but was once again re-titled Governor, who was now responsible to all Three Excellencies.
During early Eastern Han, the loss of Han's control over the <a href="Ordos%20Desert">Ordos Desert</a> prompted the Han court to reduce the provinces to twelve—excluding the capital region—in 35 AD. In that year, the Inspectors-cum-Governors were still appointed by the central government, but their staffs were recruited from local administrations where they were transferred. By 42 AD, the title Governor once more became Inspector, who remained the head of provincial authorities until 188 AD. In 188 AD, at the urging of the official <a href="Liu%20Yan%20%28Han%20dynasty%20warlord%29">Liu Yan</a>, <a href="Emperor%20Ling">Emperor Ling</a> reinstated the office of Governor, yet some of the provinces were still administered by Inspectors; this arrangement remained in place until the <a href="end%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">end of the Han dynasty</a> in 220 AD. A key difference between the roles was that an Inspector had no executive powers and only an advisory role, whereas a Governor could execute decisions on his own behalf. There were exceptions to this rule. If banditry or rebellion simultaneously arose in several commanderies under his jurisdiction at once, the Inspector was authorized to raise troops throughout all commanderies under his watch and lead this united force as commander to quell the disruption.

Both the Inspector and Governor were responsible for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, as well as the semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.

There were thirteen commanderies, including the capital region, and ten kingdoms at the beginning of Western Han. Many kingdoms were reduced in size and the empire's territory expanded through conquest. By 2 AD there were eighty-three commanderies and twenty kingdoms containing an aggregate total of approximately 58 million people according to the <a href="census">census</a>. A commandery consisted of a group of counties and was governed by an Administrator ("Taishou" 太守), also known as Grand Administrator, who was appointed by the central government and earned a 2,000-"dan" salary-rank. The Administrator was the civil and military leader of the commandery. He was not allowed to govern over his native commandery.

An Administrator was assisted by one or several Commandants ("Duwei" 都尉) also known as Chief Commandant, who handled all local military affairs such as raising <a href="militia">militia</a>s, suppressing bandit groups, and building <a href="beacon">beacon</a> towers. The Commandants' salary-rank was Equivalent to 2,000-"dan". After 30 AD, all Commandants who were not located in distant frontier commanderies were abolished, yet if the commandery was located along borders where raids and armed incursions by hostile nomadic groups were frequent, he was still appointed. A Commandant in an interior commandery could only be appointed temporarily to deal with crises as they arose. Each commandery also had secretaries, a treasurer, and an Official in Charge of Accounts who submitted annual reports to the imperial court on the Administrator's performance.

Many of the Administrators' duties were seasonal, such as inspections of counties every spring to check on agriculture and maintain roads, bridges, dikes and other public works. In the fall he sent subordinates into the counties to report whether local criminal lawsuits had been conducted fairly. He was responsible for recommending worthy nominees, known as <a href="Xiaolian">Filial and Incorrupt</a>, to the capital at the end each year during winter; the nominees would then be considered for an appointment to a central or local government office. This followed a system of quotas for each of the commanderies that was first established during Emperor Wu's reign, when two Filial and Incorrupt men from each commandery were sent to the capital. This was changed in 92 AD to one man for every 200,000 households in a commandery. After the Commandants of interior commanderies were abolished, the Administrators assumed their duties, yet they were still not allowed to raise militias, mobilize troops, or send troops outside their commandery without permission from the central government.

The nationwide census conducted in 2 AD, listed 1,587 counties. The Han county was the smallest political division containing a centrally appointed official. In larger counties of about 10,000 households he was known as the Prefect ("Ling" 令); in smaller counties he was known as the Chief ("Zhang" 長). Depending on the size of the county, the Prefect's salary-rank was 600-"dan" or 1,000-"dan", while a Chief was ranked at 300-"dan" or 500-"dan". Due to their judicial role, historian <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a> does not differentiate between Prefects and Chiefs, referring to both as <a href="County%20magistrate%20%28China%29">magistrate</a>. The county's head civil servants, usually respected scholars or elders in their local communities, were appointed directly by the Magistrate.
A county Magistrate was in charge of maintaining law and order, storing grain in case of famine, registering the populace for taxation, mobilizing conscripted commoners for corvée labor projects, supervising public works, renovating schools, and performing rituals. They were also given the duty to act as judge for all lawsuits brought to the county court. The judicial jurisdictions of the commandery Administrator and county Magistrate overlapped, so it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first would try him or her. Under Emperor Wu, commanderies and kingdoms operated public schools, and although counties could operate their own public schools, not all of them did.

The county was further divided into <a href="District%20%28China%29">districts</a>, each consisting of at least several <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlets</a> grouped together; typically a community of approximately one hundred families. A <a href="chief%20of%20police">chief of police</a> was assigned to each district by the county Magistrate. A county Magistrate heavily relied on the cooperation of local elders and leaders at the district level; these carried out much of the day-to-day affairs of arbitrating disputes in their communities, collecting taxes, and fighting crime.

A <a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">Han kingdom</a> was much like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the <a href="fief">fief</a> of a relative to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder <a href="Emperor%20Gaozu%20of%20Han">Emperor Gaozu of Han</a> (r. 202–195 BC), as many of the early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the <a href="Chu-Han%20contention">Chu-Han contention</a> (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his <a href="Queen%20consort">queen</a>.

The number of kingdoms fluctuated between Western and Eastern Han, but there were never fewer than eight nor greater than twenty-five. In the early Western Han, the kingdoms accounted for approximately two-thirds of the empire. The imperial court ruled over the commanderies located in the western third of the empire, while kings ruled their fiefs with little or no central government intervention. The administrative staffs of each kingdom paralleled the model of central government, as each kingdom had a Grand Tutor (ranked 2000–"dan"), Chancellor (2,000-"dan"), and Imperial Secretary (2,000-"dan"). No kingdom was allowed to have a Grand Commandant, since they were not allowed to initiate war campaigns on their own behalf. Although the kingdoms' Chancellors were appointed by the imperial court, the king had the right to appoint all other officials in his fief.

The power of the kings declined after the <a href="Rebellion%20of%20the%20Seven%20States">Rebellion of the Seven States</a> in 154 BC; the number of kingdoms and their sizes were reduced. An imperial edict in 145 BC removed the kings' rights to appoint officials above the salary-rank of 400-"dan", and all officials ranked higher than this were appointed directly by the central government. Excluding the kingdom-level Minister Coachman, the kingdoms' Nine Ministers and Imperial Counselors were abolished. The Chancellor, now the equivalent of a commandery Administrator, was retained, although he was still appointed by the central government. After these reforms, the kings were no longer administrative heads and merely took a portion of the taxes collected by the government in their kingdoms as personal income. <a href="Charles%20Hucker">Charles Hucker</a> notes that after this transformation of kingdoms and marquessates into virtual commanderies and counties, respectively, a "... fully centralized government was achieved" for the first time since the Qin dynasty.

Han society below the level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain privileges such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a <a href="marquess">marquess</a> and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate ("houguo" 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.

The emperor's sisters and daughters were made either senior <a href="princess">princess</a>es, who shared the same rank as kings, or princesses, who shared the same rank as full marquesses; a princess's fief was typically the size of a county. The husband of a princess was ranked as a marquess. The daughters of kings were also princesses, but their fiefs were typically the smaller size of county districts, and could not be inherited by sons. Unlike the fiefs of kings and marquesses, the staffs of the princesses' fiefs answered directly to one of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan.

Upon reaching the age of twenty-three, male commoners became eligible for <a href="conscription">conscription</a> into <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty">the armed forces</a> ("zhengzu" 正卒) for one year of training and one year of service; the year of service could be served until the age of fifty-six. Conscripts were trained, and would serve in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or naval marine. The year of service could take the form of soldiering at frontier garrisons protecting the borders against nomadic enemies, serving as guards in the courts of kings or as guards under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. By 155 BC, the minimum age for conscription was lowered to twenty. During <a href="Emperor%20Zhao%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhao of Han</a>'s (r. 87–74 BC) reign, the minimum age was raised to twenty-three, but after his reign it was once again reduced to twenty.
Although this system of conscription survived into Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided upon payment of a commutable tax.

The government also exempted those who presented authorities with a slave, a horse, or grain. In the system of twenty ranks bestowed on commoners and nobles alike, those of the ninth rank and above were exempt from military service. To compensate for the loss of manpower, the Eastern Han government favored the recruitment of a largely <a href="Volunteer%20military">volunteer army</a>. Many other soldiers in Eastern Han were convicted criminals who commuted their sentences by joining the army. <a href="Mercenary">Mercenaries</a> eventually comprised much of the capital guard, while foreign nomadic tribes were often employed to guard the frontiers.

After their year of active service, Western Han-era soldiers were demobilized and sent home, where they were obligated to join the local <a href="militia">militia</a> that convened every eighth month of the year. This obligation was intended to curb local and regional <a href="warlord">warlord</a>ism that nonetheless became prevalent by the end of Han. Militias dismissed members who reached the age of fifty-six. By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired soldiers to join local militias was removed.

The non-professional conscripted soldiers who served a one-year term under the Minister of the Guards belonged to the Southern Army ("Nanjun" 南軍). Non-conscripted, professional soldiers belonged to a <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> known as the Northern Army ("Beijun" 北軍). The Northern Army's main purpose was to defend the capital, but it was sometimes required to repel foreign invasions. The Northern Army is first mentioned in Han records in about 180 BC, yet little is known of its command structure at that time. Several decades later, Emperor Wu reformed the Northern Army's <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer corps</a> so that its command was shared by five Colonels ("Xiaowei" 校尉) who each ranked 2,000-"dan" and commanded a regiment. Emperor Wu also appointed three other Colonels, ranked 2,000-"dan", whose forces were considered an extension of the Northern Army yet were stationed far outside the capital at strategic passes. Each of the eight Colonels was assisted by a Major ("Sima" 司馬) who was ranked at 1,000-"dan". Professional soldiers could also be found in <a href="Tuntian">agricultural garrisons</a> established in the <a href="Western%20Regions">Western Regions</a>, such as those led by the Wu and Ji Colonels ("Wuji xiaowei" 戊己校尉), who were ranked Equivalent to 600-"dan" and were based at the <a href="Turpan">Turpan</a> oasis.

During Eastern Han, the conscripted army largely gave way to a volunteer army. The conscripted army under the Minister of the Guards was no longer referred to as the Southern Army. The Northern Army was retained, although it was reformed so that there were five Colonels instead of eight. The Eastern Han-era Colonels of the Northern Army were also demoted to the rank of Equivalent to 2,000-"dan".

According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army was a relatively small fighting force of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers. To aid this force, Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of <a href="army%20reserves">army reserves</a> in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 AD, while two other reserve units were created in 110 AD; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer). The main purpose of these reserve units was to position Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower <a href="Wei%20River">Wei River</a> against Xiongnu, <a href="Wuhuan">Wuhuan</a>, and <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an tribes.

During peacetime and war, the command structure of the Northern Army remained the same. However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace. Large <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> were led by a General ("Jiangjun" 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided into a number of <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major. Regiments were divided into <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-"dan", while companies were further divided into <a href="platoon">platoon</a>s.

Plunketts Creek (Loyalsock Creek tributary)

Plunketts Creek is an approximately <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a> in <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming</a> and <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan</a> counties in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Two <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> <a href="village">village</a>s and a <a href="hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a> are on the creek, and its <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a> drains in parts of five townships. The creek is a part of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> drainage basin via Loyalsock Creek and the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branch Susquehanna</a> and <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>s.

Plunketts Creek's name comes from the first owner of the land including the creek's <a href="river%20delta">mouth</a>, and the creek has given its name to two <a href="civil%20township">townships</a> (although one has since changed its name). The creek flows southwest and then south through the <a href="Dissected%20plateau">dissected</a> <a href="Allegheny%20Plateau">Allegheny Plateau</a>, through rock from the <a href="Mississippian%20age">Mississippian</a> sub-period and <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period. Much of the Plunketts Creek valley is composed of various glacial deposits, chiefly <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a>.

Although the Plunketts Creek watershed was <a href="clearcutting">clear-cut</a> and home to a <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a>, sawmills, and a coal mine in the nineteenth century, today it is heavily wooded and known for its high water quality, <a href="fishing">fishing</a>, and other recreational opportunities. The watershed now includes parts of the <a href="Loyalsock%20State%20Forest">Loyalsock State Forest</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a>, and a State Game Farm for raising <a href="Common%20pheasant">pheasant</a>. Tourism, hunting, and fishing have long been important in the region, and the year-round population of Plunketts Creek Township is increasing much faster than that of either Lycoming or Sullivan County.

Plunketts Creek is named for <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> William Plunkett, a <a href="physician">physician</a>, who was the first president <a href="judge">judge</a> of <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County</a> after it was formed in 1772. During conflicts with <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, he treated wounded settlers and fought the natives. Plunkett led a Pennsylvania expedition in the <a href="Pennamite%E2%80%93Yankee%20War">Pennamite–Yankee War</a> to forcibly remove <a href="settler">settler</a>s from <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, who had claimed and settled on lands also claimed by Pennsylvania. For his services, Plunkett was granted six tracts of land totaling on November 14, 1776, although the land was not actually surveyed until September 1783. Plunkett's land included the creek's <a href="river%20delta">mouth</a>, so Plunketts Creek was given his name.

During the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, Plunkett did not actively support the revolution and thus was suspected of being sympathetic to the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. He died in 1791, aged about 100, and was buried in <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland</a>, without a grave marker or monument (except for the creek that bears his name). Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795. When <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plunketts Creek Township</a> was formed in Lycoming County in 1838, the original name proposed was "Plunkett Township" but the lingering suspicions of his <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">British sympathies</a> led to that name being rejected. Naming the township for the creek was an acceptable compromise.

Plunketts Creek Township was originally much larger than it is now, and two other townships were formed from parts of it. When Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County on March 15, 1847, Plunketts Creek Township was divided between the counties, with each having a township of the same name. This led to some confusion and in 1856 the citizens of Sullivan County petitioned the state legislature to change the name of their Plunketts Creek Township to <a href="Hillsgrove%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hillsgrove Township</a>, for <a href="Hillsgrove%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hillsgrove</a>, the main village and post office in the township. In 1866, <a href="Cascade%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cascade Township</a> was formed from parts of <a href="Hepburn%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hepburn</a> and Plunketts Creek Townships in Lycoming County.

According to Meginness (1892), Colonel Plunkett actually spelled his last name "Plunket", but the current spelling was established "by custom and the courts". As of 2018, it is the only stream officially named "Plunketts Creek" on <a href="USGS">USGS</a> maps of the United States and in the USGS <a href="Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System">Geographic Names Information System</a>. (There is a "<a href="Plunkett%20Creek%20%28Tennessee%29">Plunkett Creek</a>" in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> which has "Plunketts Creek" as an official variant name). The possessive <a href="apostrophe">apostrophe</a> is not part of the official name of the creek, although records from the 19th century often spell it as "Plunkett's Creek". No Native American name for Plunketts Creek is known. Two streams in the watershed have given their names to roads in Plunketts Creek Township: Engle Run Drive and Mock Run Road.

The <a href="source%20%28river%29">source</a> of Plunketts Creek is 1440 ft (439 m) above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, northwest of the <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> village of Hillsgrove and just south of the <a href="Loyalsock%20State%20Forest">Loyalsock State Forest</a> in Hillsgrove Township, Sullivan County. The source is a pond just north of Pennsylvania Route 4010 (the road between the villages of Proctor and Hillsgrove) and Plunketts Creek crosses the road twice, then receives two unnamed tributaries on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right bank</a> as it flows generally southwest about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the Lycoming County line.

The creek continues southwest as it enters Plunketts Creek Township and receives Reibsan Run on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left bank</a>, 4.70 miles (7.56 km) upstream from the mouth. It next receives Mock Creek at the hamlet of <a href="Hoppestown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hoppestown</a> (4.24 miles (6.82 km) from the mouth), then Wolf Run (2.72 miles (4.38 km) from the mouth), both on the right bank. At the village of <a href="Proctor%2C%20Pennsylvania">Proctor</a>, Plunketts Creek receives King Run (1.66 miles (2.67 km)) on the right bank, then turns south towards Loyalsock Creek. It flows through the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Game%20Commission">Pennsylvania Game Commission</a>'s Northcentral Game Farm, then receives the unnamed tributary in Coal Mine Hollow on the right bank and Dry Run on the left bank (0.82 miles (1.32 km) and 0.17 miles (0.27 km), respectively). It finally enters the village of <a href="Barbours%2C%20Pennsylvania">Barbours</a>, where its mouth is on the right bank of Loyalsock Creek at 725 feet (221 m).

Lycoming County is about 130 miles (209 km) northwest of Philadelphia and 165 miles (266 km) east-northeast of Pittsburgh. Although Plunketts Creek is 6.2 miles (10.0 km) long,} the direct distance between the source and the mouth is only 4.1 miles (6.6 km). From the mouth of Plunketts Creek it is 19.50 miles (31.38 km) along Loyalsock Creek to its <a href="confluence%20%28geography%29">confluence</a> with the West Branch Susquehanna River at <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>. The elevation at the source is 1440 feet (439 m), while the mouth is at an elevation of 725 feet (221 m). The difference in elevation, 715 feet (218 m), divided by the length of the creek of 6.2 miles (10.0 km) gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or <a href="relief%20ratio">relief ratio</a> of 115.3 feet/mile (21.8 m/km). For comparison, the relief ratio of <a href="Wallis%20Run">Wallis Run</a> (the next watershed to the southwest) is 110.9 feet/mile (21.0 m/km), while Loyalsock Creek's is only 28.0 feet/mile (5.33 m/km).

Plunketts Creek can vary greatly in depth, depending on the season and recent precipitation. Its water level is typically highest (perhaps 3 feet (1 m) deep) in spring or for a few days after a heavy rain, and lowest in late summer, when it can . While there is no <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> on Plunketts Creek, a rough estimate of the creek's water level may be found from the stream gauge on the Loyalsock Creek bridge in Barbours, just downstream of the mouth. Lycoming County operates this gauge as part of the county-wide flood warning system. It only measures the water height (not discharge), and measured a record gauge height of on September 7, 2011.

The September 2011 flood was caused by remnants of <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Lee%20%282011%29">Tropical Storm Lee</a>, which dumped of rainfall in the nearby village of <a href="Shunk%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shunk</a> in <a href="Fox%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Fox Township</a> in Sullivan County (just north of the creek's source). The 2011 flooding caused widespread damage in Proctor and Barbours and destroyed a small stone bridge on Wallis Run Road in Proctor over King Run, a tributary of Plunketts Creek. The Barbours Fire Hall became an "emergency relief center offering food, shelter and supplies to victims of the flood". Further downstream on the Loyalsock, the flooding badly damaged the historic <a href="Hillsgrove%20Covered%20Bridge">Hillsgrove Covered Bridge</a>, washed out sections of <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2087">Pennsylvania Route 87</a> along the creek, and destroyed the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20973">Pennsylvania Route 973</a> and <a href="Lycoming%20Valley%20Railroad">Lycoming Valley Railroad</a> bridges over the creek near and in <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>.

The previous record flood reached on the Loyalsock flood gauge at Barbours on January 19–20, 1996. This major flood resulted from heavy rain, snow melt, and ice dams, which caused millions of dollars of damage throughout Lycoming County, and six deaths on <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a> in and near Williamsport. On Plunketts Creek, the flood heavily damaged and later caused the demolition of <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Bridge%20No.%203">Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3</a>, a mid-19th century <a href="stone%20arch">stone arch</a> bridge listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. The flood waters were 4 feet (1.2 m) deep in Barbours and it was called the village's "worst flood in history" at the time.

Plunketts Creek is in the southern edge of the dissected <a href="Allegheny%20Plateau">Allegheny Plateau</a>, near the <a href="Allegheny%20Front">Allegheny Front</a>. The underlying bedrock is sandstone and shale, mostly from the <a href="Mississippian%20%28geologic%20period%29">Mississippian</a> sub-period, with rock from the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period in the north of the watershed. The northern edge of the Plunketts Creek drainage basin is formed by Burnetts Ridge and Popple Ridge. Plunketts Creek flows along the north side of Camp Mountain and, on turning south at Proctor, forms a <a href="water%20gap">water gap</a> between it and Cove Mountain (to the west).

The watershed has no oil or conventional natural gas fields. However, a potentially large source of natural gas is the <a href="Marcellus%20Formation">Marcellus shale</a>, which lies 1.5 to 2.0 miles (2.4 to 3.2 km) below the surface here and stretches from <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> through Pennsylvania to <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian period range from 168 to 516 trillion cubic feet (4.76 to 14.6 trillion m), with at least 10 percent considered recoverable.

The Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey's "Distribution of Pennsylvania Coals" map shows no major deposits of coal in the Plunketts Creek watershed, and only one deposit nearby in the Loyalsock Creek watershed (in southern Plunketts Creek Township). However, Meginness (1892) refers to coal mines in Plunketts Creek Township, and there is an unnamed tributary of Plunketts Creek in "Coal Mine Hollow" on the right bank between Dry Run and King Run, so it seems a small coal mine operated there in the past.

Much of the Plunketts Creek valley (and those of its tributaries) is composed of various glacial deposits. Closer to the mouth, there are large deposits of <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a>, as well as <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a> and <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> <a href="stream%20terrace">terraces</a>. Many of the glacial deposits are associated with the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a>, with <a href="stratum">stratified</a> <a href="drift%20%28geology%29">drift</a> and <a href="till">till</a>, as well as <a href="outwash%20plain">outwash</a> present. The alluvium is "10 feet (3 m) or more thick in the lower reaches of the Plunketts Creek valley", but only "6 feet (2 m) thick in headward tributary valleys". The outwash is described as "stratified sand and gravel that form terrace remnants along the flanks of Loyalsock Creek and Plunketts Creek valleys".

The Plunketts Creek <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> drains parts of Cascade, <a href="McNett%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">McNett</a>, and Plunketts Creek townships in Lycoming County, and <a href="Fox%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Fox</a> and Hillsgrove Townships in Sullivan County (with most of the watershed in Plunketts Creek Township). The drainage basin area is , accounting for 4.78% of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. <a href="Bear%20Creek%20%28Loyalsock%20Creek%29">Bear Creek</a>, whose mouth is also within the village of Barbours but on the opposite (left) bank, is the nearest major creek at 0.52 miles (0.84 km) downstream, as measured along Loyalsock Creek. (It is also known as "Big Bear Creek" as it is the watershed upstream of "Little Bear Creek".) The neighboring major watersheds on the same bank are Wallis Run (9.56 miles (15.39 km) downstream) and <a href="Mill%20Creek%20%28Loyalsock%20Creek%29">Mill Creek</a> (at the village of Hillsgrove, 9.16 miles (14.74 km) upstream). <a href="Pleasant%20Stream%20%28Lycoming%20Creek%29">Pleasant Stream</a>, a tributary of Lycoming Creek, is the watershed to the north.

The named tributaries together account for 70.6% of the Plunketts Creek watershed. The largest tributary is Wolf Run, with an area of , accounting for 31.3% of the total. The Wolf Run drainage basin includes both the Noon Branch (4.26 square miles (11.03 km)) and the Brian Branch (1.60 square miles (4.14 km)). The next largest tributary of Plunketts Creek is King Run with or 23.6% of the watershed. The King Run watershed includes Engle Run, with . The third largest tributary is Dry Run with or 7.6%, followed by the unnamed tributary in Coal Mine Hollow with or 4.6%. All other named tributaries are less than and account for less than 5% of the drainage basin individually. Plunketts Creek does not have its own watershed association, but is part of the larger Loyalsock Creek Watershed Association.

The <a href="clearfelling">clear-cutting</a> of forests in the 19th century adversely affected the ecology of the Plunketts Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries then included a coal mine and <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a> (which are long since departed). In the autumn of 1897, three men working with hides at the Proctor tannery were stricken with <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, two fatally. Another four deaths originally blamed on <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> were suspected of being due to pulmonary anthrax, and some cattle drinking from Plunketts Creek downstream from the tannery were also infected. As late as 1959, the sludge pile from the tannery was still visible in Proctor, but was not disturbed for fear of anthrax spores. No <a href="acid%20mine%20drainage">acid mine drainage</a> is reported in the watershed.

As of 1984, the mean annual <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> for the Loyalsock Creek watershed (which Plunketts Creek is part of) was 42 to 48 inches (1067 to 1219 mm). Pennsylvania receives the greatest amount of <a href="acid%20rain">acid rain</a> of any state in the United States. Because Plunketts Creek is in a sandstone and shale mountain region, it has a relatively low capacity to <a href="Neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralize</a> added acid. This makes it especially vulnerable to increased acidification from acid rain, which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek. The <a href="Alkalinity">total alkalinity</a> (TA) is a measure of the capacity of water to neutralize acid, with a larger TA corresponding to a greater capacity. In 2007, the TA of two subtributaries was known: Engle Run, a 4.9-mile (7.9 km) tributary of King Run, had a TA of 5, and the Noon Branch, a 1.9-mile (3.1 km) tributary of Wolf Run, had a TA of 9.

The 2002 <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> (DCNR) report on "State Forest Waters with Special Protection" rated Plunketts Creek (from its source to mouth) and two of it tributaries, Wolf Run and Mock Creek (from the county line to the mouth), as "High Quality-Cold Water Fisheries". Two subtributaries were rated as "Exceptional Value" streams for fishing: Engle Run and the Noon Branch of Wolf Run.

Meginness (1892) wrote that "Plunkett's Creek township, on account of its dashing mountain streams of pure water, has always been a favorite place for trout fishing." In 2007, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission">Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission</a> classified both Engle Run and the Noon Branch of Wolf Run as <a href="Class%20A%20Wild%20Trout%20Waters">Class A Wild Trout Waters</a>, defined as "streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery." Barbours has been popular from early on with "anglers seeking trout in the 'Sock and its tributaries", as well as with hunters after <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>, <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, and <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> in the surrounding forests.

Besides fishing, the Plunketts Creek watershed contains much of the of <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> No. 134, in both Lycoming and Sullivan counties. Habitat is found there for deer, <a href="ruffed%20grouse">ruffed grouse</a>, and wild turkey. Hunting, trapping, and fishing are possible with proper licenses on both the state forest and State Game Lands. Camping, hiking, mountain bike and horseback riding, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and bird watching are all possible on state forest lands. The southern end of the 27.1 mile (43.6 km) long <a href="Old%20Loggers%20Path">Old Loggers Path</a>, a loop hiking trail, runs through the watershed just north of Engle and Wolf Runs.

The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the <a href="Iroquoian%20languages">Iroquoian</a> speaking <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" in <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>. <a href="Decimation%20%28Roman%20army%29%23Current%20usage%20of%20the%20word">Decimated</a> by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been <a href="cultural%20assimilation">assimilated</a> into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River%20Valley">West Branch Susquehanna River Valley</a> were then chiefly occupied by the <a href="Munsee">Munsee</a> <a href="phratry">phratry</a> of the Lenape (or Delaware), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>.

On November 5, 1768, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> acquired the "<a href="New%20Purchase%20%281768%29">New Purchase</a>" from the Iroquois in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>, opening what are now Lycoming and Sullivan counties to settlement. Initial settlements were on or near the West Branch Susquehanna River, and, as noted, Plunkett did not receive the land including the creek until 1776, nor was it surveyed until 1783. It is not clear if Plunkett ever lived on his land: he resided in Northumberland at the time of his death. A <a href="squatter">squatter</a> named Paulhamus was the first recorded inhabitant of what became Plunketts Creek Township, living there "some time between 1770 and 1776". He was reputed to be a deserter from the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and left only when he was captured by British soldiers.

Like all streams in Lycoming and Sullivan Counties, Plunketts Creek served as an area for settlers to establish <a href="homestead%20%28buildings%29">homesteads</a>, mills, and to a lesser extent, farms. Barbours, the first village on the creek, was founded in 1832, when John S. Barbour, a <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> immigrant, built a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> opposite the mouth of Plunketts Creek on Loyalsock Creek. Originally known as "Barbour's Mills", the village is in a rare area of flat land in the narrow Loyalsock valley and contains the mouths of both Plunketts and Bear Creeks. Barbours became a lumber center which owed "its existence to those forested mountains and the creeks that flow out of them". John Scaife arrived in 1856 and became a prosperous lumberman and farmer. His family became prominent in Barbours, and in 1997, his 86-year-old granddaughter, Virdie Scaife Houser Landon, recalled that in her childhood "every family that had 15 cents to their name had a sawmill for cutting lumber." By 1878 the village had several <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>s, a <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> hotel, its own <a href="post%20office">post office</a>, many sawmills, a school, and a wagon maker. Barbours flourished throughout the rest of the nineteenth century.

In 1868, Proctor was built as a <a href="company%20town">company town</a> in the midst of the timber required for the tannery (Barbours had initially been considered for the site). The second village on Plunketts Creek was originally named "Proctorville" for Thomas E. Proctor of <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>, who produced leather for the soles of shoes there. Proctor was brought to the area by William Stone of <a href="Standing%20Stone%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Standing Stone Township</a> in <a href="Bradford%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bradford County</a>, who knew the area was "one vast tract of <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a> timber". The Proctor tannery employed "several hundred" at wages between 50 cents and <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1.75 a day, the employees living in one hundred twenty company houses, each renting for $2 a month. Hemlock bark, used in the tanning process, was hauled to the tannery from up to 8 miles (13 km) away in both summer and winter, using wagons and sleds. The hides which were tanned to make leather came from the United States, and as far away as <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and China. In 1892, Proctor had a barber shop, two blacksmiths, cigar stand, <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">I.O.O.F</a> hall, leather shop, news stand, a post office (established in 1885), a two-room school, two stores, and a wagon shop. Finished sole leather was hauled by horse-drawn wagon south about 8 miles (13 km) to Little Bear Creek, where it was exchanged for "green" <a href="Hide%20%28skin%29">hides</a> and other supplies brought north from Montoursville.

Plunketts Creek was a source of power in the nineteenth century and "water-powered sawmills, woolen mills, and grist (grain) mills lined the 'Sock and Plunketts and Big Bear Creeks". Although hemlock logs were originally left to rot after their bark was peeled for tanning, with time their lumber was used, among other places in a sawmill on Engle Run north of Proctor. By 1892 there were two <a href="steam%20power">steam power</a>ed <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>s on Plunketts Creek: one 0.5 miles (0.8 km) above the mouth, and the other 4.0 miles (6.4 km) up the creek, near Hoppestown. An extension of the <a href="Susquehanna%20and%20Eagles%20Mere%20Railroad">Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad</a> crossed an unnamed tributary of Plunketts Creek near its source in Sullivan County in 1906, running from the village of Hillsgrove northwest to the lumber <a href="boomtown">boomtown</a> of <a href="Masten%2C%20Pennsylvania">Masten</a> in Cascade and <a href="McNett%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">McNett Townships</a> in Lycoming County. A logging railroad was built by the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company (CPL) in the far northern part of the watershed in the 1920s. It crossed Engle Run twice and ran parallel to Wolf Run, near both their sources. No other railroads crossed or ran along Plunketts Creek.

The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled. Lumbering continued in the watershed, but the last logs were floated down Plunketts Creek to the Loyalsock in 1905. The Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad was abandoned in sections between 1922 and 1930, as the lumber it was built to transport was depleted. The CPL logging railroad and their Masten sawmills were abandoned in 1930. Without timber, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses. Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its thirty-ninth annual "Proctor Homecoming" reunion called it a "near-deserted old tannery town". In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel (which had become a hunting club) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek.

<a href="Secondary%20forest">Second growth forests</a> have since covered most of the clear-cut land. The beginnings of today's protected areas were established in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Pennsylvania's state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned clear-cut land in 1897, creating the <a href="List%20of%20Pennsylvania%20state%20forests">state forest</a> system. The Game Commission began acquiring property for State Game Lands in 1920, and established the Northcentral State Game Farm on Plunketts Creek in 1945 to raise wild turkey. It was converted to <a href="common%20pheasant">Ringneck pheasant</a> production in 1981, and, as of 2007, it is one of four Pennsylvania state game farms producing about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is in the Plunketts Creek valley just south of Proctor, and a part of it is on the right bank of Loyalsock Creek downstream of the confluence. The Loyalsock State Game Farm is 13 miles (21 km) downstream on Loyalsock Creek, at the village of Loyalsockville. When a May 2007 fire destroyed a brooder house there just days before 18,000 pheasant chicks were due to hatch, the eggs were transferred to the nearby Northcentral State Game Farm without reduction in the production goal.
As of 2007, Proctor has two separate businesses: a <a href="general%20store">general store</a> (which also sells gasoline) and a <a href="bed%20and%20breakfast">bed and breakfast</a>. The church which used to host the annual "Proctor Homecoming" reunions still stands, but is closed. Barbours has no store or gas station, but does have one church. Barbours is home to the Plunketts Creek Township Volunteer Fire Company and township municipal building (which houses a small branch library). Since 1967, Barbours has been home to Pneu-Dart, which makes tranquilizer darts and guns for livestock and wildlife capture and control. In 1997, Pneu-Dart had eight employees. Today much of Plunketts Creek's watershed is wooded and protected as part of <a href="Loyalsock%20State%20Forest">Loyalsock State Forest</a> or <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> No. 134. Pennsylvania's state forests and game lands are managed, and small-scale lumbering operations continue in the watershed today. Barbours has one sawmill, in 1997 it had thirty contract loggers and fifteen employees, with $1.2 million in annual gross sales.

Plunketts Creek has been a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded. Before the advent of automobiles, the area was quite isolated and the 16 mile (26 km) trip to Montoursville took at least three hours (today it takes less than half an hour). Residents who used to work locally now commute to <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Williamsport</a>. "Cabin people" have seasonally increased the population for years, but increasing numbers now live there year-round. From 1950 to 2000, the population of Plunketts Creek Township increased 80.6 percent from 427 to 771 (for comparison, in the same period Lycoming County's population increased by only 18.6 percent, while Sullivan County's declined by 2.9 percent). Tourists still come too: the opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.


"Note: Plunketts Creek is in the Loyalsock Creek watershed in the West Branch Susquehanna River subbasin."

Taapaca

Taapaca is a <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> <a href="volcanic%20complex">volcanic complex</a> in northern <a href="Chile">Chile</a>'s <a href="Arica%20y%20Parinacota%20Region">Arica y Parinacota Region</a>. Located in the Chilean <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, it is part of the <a href="Central%20Volcanic%20Zone">Central Volcanic Zone</a> of the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">Andean Volcanic Belt</a>, one of four distinct volcanic chains in South America. The town of <a href="Putre">Putre</a> lies at the southwestern foot of the volcano.

Like other volcanoes of the Central Volcanic Zone, Taapaca formed from the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> beneath the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South America Plate</a>. It lies on the western margin of the <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a> high plateau, on top of older volcanic and sedimentary units. Taapaca has mainly erupted <a href="dacite">dacite</a>, in the form of numerous <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s, although an <a href="Andesite">andesitic</a> <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> is also present.

Volcanic activity at Taapaca occurred in several stages starting during the <a href="Plio-Pleistocene">Plio-Pleistocene</a>. The emplacement of lava domes was often followed by their collapse and the formation of <a href="block%20and%20ash%20flow">block-and-ash avalanches</a>, and parts of the volcano underwent <a href="sector%20collapse">sector collapse</a>s (large <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s). It was at first assumed that activity ended during the Pleistocene, but late eruptions occurred until 2,300 years ago; the latest is dated to 320 <a href="BCe">BCE</a>. The <a href="National%20Geology%20and%20Mining%20Service">Chilean Geological Service</a> monitors the volcano as it is a hazard to Putre, but eruptions could also impact local roads and areas as far east as <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>.

The term "tara paka" is <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara</a> for "two-headed eagle" or "winter (prey) bird", and <a href="Quechuan%20languages">Quechua</a> for Andean eagle. It is also known as Nevados de Putre; sometimes "Nevados de Putre" is used to refer to the volcanic complex and "Taapaca" to its highest summit. The term "taapaca" may also be the origin of the term "<a href="tarapaca%20%28disambiguation%29">tarapaca</a>" and could be an Aymara name for the founder deity <a href="Viracocha">Viracocha</a>. "Putre" in turn appears to mean "sound of falling water" in Aymara.

Taapaca lies in the <a href="Parinacota%20Province">Parinacota</a> <a href="province">province</a> of the <a href="Arica%20y%20Parinacota%20Region">Arica y Parinacota Region</a>. Northern Chile has little documented volcanic activity during the <a href="Holocene">last ten thousand years</a> with the majority of eruptions documented at <a href="Guallatiri">Guallatiri</a>, <a href="Lascar%20%28volcano%29">Lascar</a> and <a href="Parinacota%20Volcano">Parinacota</a>. The first and the last of these three volcanoes as well as Taapaca itself are part of the <a href="Lauca%20National%20Park">Lauca National Park</a>. Taapaca volcano can be reached from the <a href="Tambo%20Quemado">Tambo Quemado</a>-<a href="Arica">Arica</a> international road.

Volcanism in the Andes is caused by the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> and the <a href="Antarctic%20Plate">Antarctic Plate</a> beneath the <a href="South%20America%20Plate">South America Plate</a> in the <a href="Peru-Chile%20Trench">Peru-Chile Trench</a>, at rates of and , respectively. The process generates fluids that are ultimately responsible for the evolution of subduction-associated <a href="magma">magma</a>s when they interact with the <a href="mantle%20wedge">mantle wedge</a> above the downgoing plate.

This subduction does not result in volcanic activity everywhere; in places where the process is shallower (<a href="Flat%20slab%20subduction">"flat slab" subduction</a>) there is no recent volcanism. Volcanism has been ongoing in the Andes since about 185 million years ago, with an increase about 27 million years ago when the <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> broke up. In 1994, the Andes were considered to contain about 178 volcanoes with <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> activity, of which 60 were further assumed to have been active during historical time.

Taapaca is part of the <a href="Central%20Volcanic%20Zone">Central Volcanic Zone</a> of the Andes, which along with the <a href="Northern%20Volcanic%20Zone">Northern Volcanic Zone</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Volcanic%20Zone">Southern Volcanic Zone</a> and the <a href="Austral%20Volcanic%20Zone">Austral Volcanic Zone</a> is one of the four volcanic belts of the Andes; these volcanic belts are separated by areas where no recent volcanism has occurred.

The Central Volcanic Zone has about 44 active volcanoes and several other <a href="caldera">caldera</a>/<a href="ignimbrite">ignimbrite</a> and <a href="volcanic%20field">volcanic field</a> centres. Older volcanoes are often well preserved owing to the dry climate. This volcanic zone features the highest volcanoes in the world, which reach elevations of here. The largest historical eruption in the Central Volcanic Zone occurred at <a href="Huaynaputina">Huaynaputina</a> in 1600 and <a href="Lascar%20%28volcano%29">Lascar</a> is the most active volcano in the region; otherwise volcanic activity is poorly recorded as most edifices are remote from human habitation.

Taapaca is located on the western margin of the <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a>, where the <a href="Cordillera%20Occidental%20%28Bolivia%29">Western Cordillera</a> has developed since the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>. The basement beneath the volcano is formed by several principally volcanic <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formations</a>, including the Lupica and sedimentary Huaylas formations and the Lauca ignimbrite (2.72 million years old); this basement is of <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> to <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> age. In some places, a <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> basement formed by <a href="amphibolite">amphibolite</a>s, <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>es and <a href="serpentinite">serpentinite</a>s crops out. The volcanoes of <a href="Kunturiri%20%28Bolivia-Chile%29">Condoriri</a>, <a href="Pomerape">Pomerape</a>, <a href="Laram%20Q%27awa%20%28Parinacota%29">Larancagua</a> and <a href="Parinacota%20Volcano">Parinacota</a> lie to the east of Taapaca. The area of the volcano is subject to contractional tectonics, with a major <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a> passing close by, but their relationship to Taapaca's volcanism is not clear.

Taapaca reaches a height of above sea level and is a <a href="volcanic%20complex">volcanic complex</a> elongated from west to east. It consists primarily of many overlapping <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s, with shapes ranging from almost elliptical to circular. <a href="Lava%20flow">Lava flow</a>s are uncommon. The volcano has generated an apron of <a href="block%20and%20ash%20flow">block-and-ash flow</a> deposits especially on the western, southwestern and eastern flanks, which has filled valleys. An <a href="andesitic">andesitic</a> <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> is also present. The total volume of the edifice is about . Volcanic material covers a surface of .

Just north of the summit, a valley begins and curves clockwise until it opens southwestward onto the flanks of the volcano, and is bordered on the site opposed to the summit by an equally clockwise trending ridge. This valley is drained by the Quebrada Pacollo stream. The main summit is formed by a Holocene dome, with a late Pleistocene dome (known as the Socapave unit) just west of the main summit.

Taapaca is usually covered by <a href="snow">snow</a>, but does not feature <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s. It is the origin of the <a href="Lluta%20River">Lluta River</a> which has its headwaters on the mountain and subsequently flows through a north-south trending valley west of the volcano. The Quebrada Allane drains the northern flank westward into the Lluta River; parts of the mountain drain into the <a href="Rio%20Lauca">Rio Lauca</a> watershed to the east. Southwest of Taapaca lies Putre, the main town of the northern <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a> of Chile.

Taapaca is mostly formed by <a href="potassium">potassium</a>-rich <a href="dacite">dacite</a>, although <a href="andesite">andesite</a> was erupted early during its activity, and one occurrence of <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> is reported. The composition of the rocks has been relatively uniform over the history of the volcano, and is characterized by a <a href="calc-alkaline">calc-alkaline</a> suite of magmas.

<a href="phenocryst">Visible minerals</a> found in rocks erupted at Taapaca include <a href="amphibole">amphibole</a>, <a href="apatite">apatite</a>, <a href="biotite">biotite</a>, <a href="clinopyroxene">clinopyroxene</a>, <a href="orthopyroxene">orthopyroxene</a>, <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> and <a href="hematite">hematite</a>, <a href="plagioclase">plagioclase</a>, <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, <a href="sanidine">sanidine</a> and <a href="titanite">titanite</a>. Dacitic rocks contain <a href="mafic">mafic</a> inclusions, and such inclusions become increasingly common the younger the rocks they are embedded in are.

The presence of mafic inclusions indicates that magma mixing occurs at Taapaca, with renewed eruptive episodes having been triggered by the injection of new andesitic magma into preexisting dacitic <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>s. These dacitic magma chambers appear to have relatively small volumes, with little movement of the magma within the chamber except for the episodes where the chambers were heated by new magma injection. Based on geothermometry, a temperature of has been inferred for the dacites. The formation of the magma has been hypothesized to occur in several steps. First, <a href="basaltic%20andesite">basaltic andesite</a>, which is the typical calc-alkaline <a href="volcanic%20arc">volcanic arc</a> basalt, mixes with <a href="basalt">basalt</a> derived from melting of sub-crustal basalt <a href="cumulate">cumulate</a>s; then the resulting mixture interacts with <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a> melts derived from <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> crustal material. The initial melt contributes most of the material in mafic inclusions and the rhyodacite contributes most of the dacite material.

The principal magma basin appears to be located at depth, although some petrological traits of the erupted rocks indicate a secondary area of petrogenesis at of depth. <a href="Fractional%20crystallization%20%28geology%29">Fractional crystallization</a> and <a href="partial%20melting">partial melting</a> are involved in the formation of Taapaca magmas.

Crustal assimilation at depths of more than was involved in the formation of the dacitic magma and contributes about 18% of the mass of the dacites. Taapaca is constructed on a fairly thick <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> and rising magma, and thus undergoes substantial interaction with the crust, meaning that crustal contamination is important in the genesis of Taapaca's magmas. This magma is then transported to shallower levels, where it crystallizes.

Taapaca lies in a region of tropical alpine climate, with large diurnal temperature fluctuations and <a href="frost">frost</a> a possibility during the night throughout the year; temperatures range between . Unlike most of Chile, precipitation occurs mainly during summer, with snowfall occasionally occurring during June and July; however the climate is largely <a href="arid">arid</a>, so vegetation is not widespread.

On the southern side of Taapaca, vegetation consists mostly of <a href="Puna%20grassland">Puna</a> <a href="shrub">shrub</a> and <a href="steppe">steppe</a>, which becomes <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a> farther west. <a href="Cushion%20plant">Cushion plant</a>s such as the noticeable "<a href="Azorella%20compacta">Azorella compacta</a>" and "<a href="Polylepis">Polylepis</a>" woods also occur, along with <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s known as "<a href="bofedal">bofedal</a>es". Woodlands were once more common in the region.

Fauna encountered in the region includes birds, <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>s, <a href="guanaco">guanaco</a>s, <a href="South%20Andean%20deer">huemuls</a>, <a href="rhea%20%28bird%29">rheas</a>, <a href="vicu%C3%B1a">vicuña</a>s and <a href="viscacha">viscacha</a>s, along with <a href="puma%20%28genus%29">pumas</a> and <a href="rodents">rodents</a>, which are fairly common. Much of the area is protected by the <a href="Lauca%20National%20Park">Lauca National Park</a>, which includes Taapaca.

Taapaca was originally considered to have been active for the last 1.5 million years during three volcanic phases. Later a fourth stage was identified, and some rocks were interpreted as pre-dating 1.5 million years ago. Eruptions at Taapaca have consisted of <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>-forming eruptions and explosive activity with avalanches of blocks and ash, which form when lava domes collapse, as has been observed in historical time at the <a href="Soufriere%20Hills">Soufriere Hills</a> and <a href="Unzen">Unzen</a> volcanoes, although these events were much smaller than reconstructed episodes at Taapaca. Only one <a href="Subplinian">subplinian eruption</a> has occurred on Taapaca, and tephra fallout deposits are not widespread. Eruptive activity has moved southward over the history of Taapaca, with activity centred at the top of the edifice.

Late Pleistocene to Holocene activity consisted of discrete episodes lasting about 10,000 years and separated by tens of thousands of years with no recognized activity. Aside from actual <a href="Volcanic%20eruption">eruptions</a>, various types of edifice collapse are recorded at Taapaca including <a href="sector%20collapse">sector collapse</a>s of segments of the volcano and mass failure of individual domes, which generated block-and-ash flows.

The oldest stage consists of Plio-Pleistocene <a href="andesite">andesite</a> <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>s, which crop out in two sites on the northern flank and are heavily eroded and partly buried by later volcanic stages. This stage of the edifice most likely consisted of a broad stratovolcano.

Subsequently, between 1.5 and 0.5 million years ago, <a href="dacitic">dacitic</a> <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>s and <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s constructed most of the northern and eastern flanks of the volcano. Their flow forms, such as flow ridges, are better preserved on the eastern flank, while <a href="glacial">glacial</a> and <a href="hydrothermal">hydrothermal</a> alteration has occurred on the northern flank and has degraded the flow forms there. On the northern and northwestern flank, block-and-ash flows up to long and with thicknesses of , down to less than thick farther away from the volcano, have covered a surface of . They often have <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s up to thick cropping out in their <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">distal</a> regions. At this time, Taapaca likely was a large <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> consisting of steep lava domes.

The third stage featured volcanic activity similar to the second stage, with its products covering especially in the central, eastern and southwestern parts of the edifice. Construction of another lava dome complex took place on the southern side of the volcano. Short and thick lava flows are located on the western flank, while the eastern flank features lava domes from this stage, one of which has a "pancake"-like appearance. Two alignments of domes date back to this time, one on the southern and the other on the eastern flank, both lined up north-south. The second and probably also the third stage were subject to <a href="glacial">glacial</a> erosion, which together with later sector collapses resulted in the removal of much of Taapaca's edifice and the exposure of the core of the volcano.

The fourth stage spans the Pleistocene and Holocene and commenced with the emplacement of the Churilinco debris avalanche, which covers a surface of . This avalanche was formed by the collapse of the older edifice between 450,000 and 430,000 years ago; most likely the collapse took place after <a href="hydrothermal">hydrothermal</a> alteration had weakened the edifice. The Tajane unit was emplaced between 430,000–25,000 years ago on the south-southwestern slopes, covering an area of . It consists of thick lava flows, some lava domes on the western flank, a debris avalanche on the southern flank and two fans of <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s on the southern and southwestern flank. Between 25,000 and 9,000 years ago the Socapave unit was emplaced; it consists of more lava domes on the western margin of Taapaca and another debris avalanche, which cuts into these domes. This avalanche covers an area of to a distance of and was apparently hot when it was emplaced. This collapse was triggered by the development of a <a href="cryptodome">cryptodome</a> inside the volcano, and Putre is constructed on the avalanche deposit as well as on Tajane, Socapave and <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> pyroclastic flows. A pyroclastic eruption occurred, filling in gaps in the Socapave debris avalanche deposit and emplacing more material atop the southern fan of the Tajane unit.

While Taapaca was once considered an <a href="extinct%20volcano">extinct volcano</a>, further research has identified eruptions during the Holocene. These gave rise to the Putre unit on the southern, central and southwestern slopes of the volcano. It consists of large lava domes on the eastern side of Taapaca, smaller domes on the southern side, and a pyroclastic sequence on the southern and southwestern slopes. This sequence consists of numerous block and ash flows along with blast deposits, which contain blocks and ash. The Putre unit also encompasses a <a href="pumice">pumice</a> flow, <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s and layers of <a href="tephra">tephra</a>. At least three pyroclastic eruptions occurred within the last 8,000 years, while tephra falls took place between 7,000 and 2,000 years ago, possibly linked to the eruption of lava domes. The <a href="Global%20Volcanism%20Program">Global Volcanism Program</a> lists eight separate eruptions of Taapaca during the Holocene, with the last eruption occurring 2,300 years ago around 320 <a href="BCE">BCE</a> ± 50 years. Taapaca was reported in the early 20th century to be <a href="Fumarole">fumarolically</a> active, but there are no recorded historical eruptions and present day activity is reflected only by <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s.

Most of the volcanoes in northern Chile are far from towns and inhabited areas and thus their activity does not create significant human hazards. <a href="Putre">Putre</a> is constructed on <a href="pyroclastic">pyroclastic</a> deposits of the Taapaca, facing a threat from future eruptions. A <a href="highway">highway</a> (<a href="Chile%20Route%2011">Chile Route 11</a> between <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a> and <a href="Arica">Arica</a>) linking <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> with the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> is also in range on the southern flank, while the road to <a href="Visviri">Visviri</a> in Peru runs along the southwestern and western flanks. Additional areas within range of Taapaca are the towns of <a href="Socoroma">Socoroma</a> and <a href="Zapahuira">Zapahuira</a>, as well as the <a href="Oruro%20Department">Oruro Department</a> in <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. The danger is accentuated by the fact that Holocene activity has affected mainly the southwestern flank, where Putre is located. The average time between eruptions at Taapaca is about 450 years.

Future activity at Taapaca could result in further sector collapses when <a href="magma">magma</a> is injected into the edifice and deforms it, to the point that the volcano becomes unstable. Likewise, if <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s are extruded onto the volcano they could generate block and ash flows as well as both primary and secondary <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s. Eruptions between April and November (when the volcano is covered by <a href="snow">snow</a>) might generate <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s, as could rainfall during the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a> between December and March; the latter type of lahar happens frequently on present-day Taapaca owing to the steep slopes of the volcano, although it usually results solely in road damage.

The Chilean <a href="SERNAGEOMIN">SERNAGEOMIN</a> geological service monitors the volcano and shows a <a href="volcano%20hazard%20level">volcano hazard level</a> for it. It also publishes a hazard map for Taapaca, which shows risk areas for <a href="lava%20bomb">lava bomb</a> falls, <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s and tephra fallout.

Mountain worship is to this day practiced by Andean people. Climbers in 2002 discovered a figurine made of <a href="seashell">seashell</a> on Taapaca's summit: such figurines were very important to the <a href="Inca%20civilization">Inkan</a> people for rain rituals. The figurine was encountered within an outline made of rocks; further Inkan ruins were discovered away from the summit on the northwest ridge. The figurine was probably emplaced to obtain a supply of water, since the Inkans believed that mountains controlled weather and thus the fertility of animals and plants. Taapaca was an Inkan mountain sanctuary, and the mountain is still said to protect the community of Putre.

Taapaca has deposits of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> in its summit area. Starting in the 1930s the "Empresa Azufrera Taapaca" ("Taapaca Sulfur Company") active in Putre mined this sulfur on Taapaca, and Taapaca's crater became the site of the Cánepa and Cía mining camp. This mining activity employed a significant number of the people in Putre.

In 2015, she founded the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation, which has advocated for the <a href="Boys%20%26amp%3B%20Girls%20Clubs%20of%20America">Boys & Girls Clubs of America</a> and the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>.

Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990 in <a href="Indian%20Hills%2C%20Kentucky">Indian Hills, Kentucky</a>, to Gary, a construction worker, and Karen ( Koch), a <a href="summer%20camp">summer camp</a> manager. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and her mother brought her up to be "tough" like them. Karen did not allow her daughter to play with other girls in preschool as she deemed her "too rough" with them. Lawrence was educated at the <a href="Public%20schools%20in%20Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Kammerer Middle School</a> in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. She did not enjoy her childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety and considered herself a misfit among her peers. Lawrence has said that her anxieties vanished when she performed on stage and that acting gave her a sense of accomplishment.

Lawrence's school activities included cheerleading, softball, field hockey and basketball, which she played on a boys' team that was coached by her father. While growing up, she was fond of horseback riding and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has an injured <a href="coccyx">tailbone</a> as a result of being thrown from a horse. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. She had her first acting assignment at age nine when she played the role of a prostitute in a church play that was based on the <a href="Book%20of%20Jonah">Book of Jonah</a>. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.

Lawrence was fourteen and on a family vacation in New York City when she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for talent agents. Karen was not keen on allowing her daughter to pursue an acting career, but she briefly moved her family to New York to let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first <a href="cold%20reading%20%28theatrical%29">cold reading</a>, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult because she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. While her mother encouraged her to go into modelling, Lawrence insisted on pursuing acting. At that time, she considered acting to be a natural fit for her abilities, and she turned down several offers for modeling assignments. Lawrence dropped out of school at age 14 without receiving a <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">GED</a> or a diploma. She has said that she was "self-educated" and that her career was her priority. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, where she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.

Lawrence began her acting career with a minor role in the television film "Company Town" (2006). She followed it with guest roles in several television shows, including "<a href="Monk%20%28TV%20series%29">Monk</a>" (2006) and "<a href="Medium%20%28TV%20series%29">Medium</a>" (2007). These parts led to her being cast as a series regular on the <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">TBS</a> sitcom "<a href="The%20Bill%20Engvall%20Show">The Bill Engvall Show</a>", in which she played <a href="The%20Bill%20Engvall%20Show%23Characters">Lauren</a>, the rebellious teenage daughter of a family living in suburban <a href="Louisville%2C%20Colorado">Louisville, Colorado</a>. The series premiered in 2007 and ran for three seasons. <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" considered her a <a href="scene%20stealer">scene stealer</a> in her part, and David Hinckley of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" wrote that she was successful in "deliver[ing] the perpetual exasperation of teenage girls". Lawrence won a <a href="Young%20Artist%20Award">Young Artist Award</a> for Outstanding Young Performer in a TV Series for the role in 2009.

Lawrence made her film debut in the 2008 drama film "<a href="Garden%20Party%20%28film%29">Garden Party</a>", in which she played a troubled teenager named Tiff. She then appeared in director <a href="Guillermo%20Arriaga">Guillermo Arriaga</a>'s feature film debut "<a href="The%20Burning%20Plain">The Burning Plain</a>" (2008), a drama narrated in a <a href="hyperlink%20cinema">hyperlink format</a>. She was cast as the teenage daughter of <a href="Kim%20Basinger">Kim Basinger</a>'s character who discovers her mother's extramarital affair—a role she shared with <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a>; both actresses portrayed the role at different stages of the character's life. Mark Feeney for "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" thought of Lawrence's performance as "a thankless task", but Derek Elley from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" praised her as the production's prime asset, writing that she "plumbs fresher depths" into the film. Her performance earned her the <a href="Marcello%20Mastroianni%20Award">Marcello Mastroianni Award</a> for Best Emerging Actress at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>. Also that year, she appeared in the music video for the song "The Mess I Made" by <a href="Parachute%20%28band%29">Parachute</a>. The following year, she starred in <a href="Lori%20Petty">Lori Petty</a>'s drama "<a href="The%20Poker%20House">The Poker House</a>" as the oldest of three sisters living with a drug-abusing mother. Stephen Farber of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" thought that Lawrence "has a touching poise on camera that conveys the resilience of children", and her role in "The Poker House" won an Outstanding Performance award from the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Film%20Festival">Los Angeles Film Festival</a>.

Lawrence's <a href="breakthrough%20role">breakthrough role</a> came in the small-scale drama "<a href="Winter%27s%20Bone">Winter's Bone</a>" (2010), based on <a href="Daniel%20Woodrell">Daniel Woodrell</a>'s novel of the same name. In <a href="Debra%20Granik">Debra Granik</a>'s independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the <a href="Ozark%20Mountains">Ozark Mountains</a> who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began to live with the family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood. <a href="David%20Denby%20%28film%20critic%29">David Denby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" said the film "would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic", and <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" wrote that "her performance is more than acting, it's a gathering storm. Lawrence's eyes are a roadmap to what's tearing Ree apart." The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. The actress was awarded the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Award%20for%20Breakthrough%20Performance">National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance</a>, and with her first nomination for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>, she became the <a href="List%20of%20oldest%20and%20youngest%20Academy%20Award%20winners%20and%20nominees">second youngest person</a> to be nominated in the category.

In 2011, Lawrence took on a supporting role in "<a href="Like%20Crazy%20%282011%20film%29">Like Crazy</a>", a romantic drama about long-distance relationships, starring <a href="Anton%20Yelchin">Anton Yelchin</a> and <a href="Felicity%20Jones">Felicity Jones</a>. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" considered the film to be an "intensely wrought and immensely satisfying love story" and credited all three performers for "making their [characters'] yearning palpable". She then appeared in <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a>'s black comedy "<a href="The%20Beaver%20%28film%29">The Beaver</a>" alongside Foster and <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. Filmed in 2009, the production was delayed due to controversy concerning Gibson, and earned less than half of its $21 million budget.

After her dramatic role in "Winter's Bone", Lawrence looked for something less serious, and found it with her first high-profile release—<a href="Matthew%20Vaughn">Matthew Vaughn</a>'s superhero film "" (2011)—a prequel to the <a href="X-Men%20%28film%20series%29">"X-Men" film series</a>. She portrayed the <a href="shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a> mutant <a href="Mystique%20%28comics%29">Mystique</a>, a role played by <a href="Rebecca%20Romijn">Rebecca Romijn</a> in the earlier films. Vaughn cast Lawrence, as he thought that she would be able to portray the weakness and strength involved in the character's transformation. For the part, Lawrence lost weight and practiced yoga. For Mystique's blue form, she had to undergo eight hours of <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">makeup</a>, as Romijn had done on the other films. She was intimidated in the role as she admired Romijn. Writing for "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", Claudia Puig considered the film to be a "classy re-boot" of the film series, and believed that her "high-spirited performance" empowered the film. With worldwide earnings of $350 million, "X-Men: First Class" became Lawrence's highest-grossing film at that point.

In 2012 she played <a href="Katniss%20Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a> in "<a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%29">The Hunger Games</a>", an adaptation of the first book in author <a href="Suzanne%20Collins">Suzanne Collins</a>' <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games">"Hunger Games" trilogy</a>. Set in a <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> future, the series tells the story of the teenage heroine Everdeen as she joins rebel forces against a totalitarian government after winning a brutal televised annual event. Despite being an admirer of the books, Lawrence was initially hesitant to accept the part, because of the grand scale of the film. She agreed to the project after her mother convinced her to take the part. She practiced yoga, archery, rock and tree climbing, and hand-to-hand combat techniques for the role. While training for the part, she injured herself running into a wall. The film received generally positive reviews, and Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen was particularly praised. <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> of "The Hollywood Reporter" called her an "ideal screen actress", adding that she embodies the Everdeen of the novel, and believed that she anchored the film "with impressive gravity and presence". <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> agreed that she was "strong and convincing in the central role". With worldwide revenues of over $690 million, "The Hunger Games" became a top-grossing film featuring a female lead, making Lawrence the highest-grossing <a href="action%20hero">action hero</a>ine of all time. The success of the film established her as a star.

Later in 2012, Lawrence played a young depressed widow named Tiffany Maxwell in <a href="David%20O.%20Russell">David O. Russell</a>'s romance movie "<a href="Silver%20Linings%20Playbook">Silver Linings Playbook</a>". The film was an adaptation of <a href="Matthew%20Quick">Matthew Quick</a>'s <a href="The%20Silver%20Linings%20Playbook%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by <a href="Bradley%20Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>), a man with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. The actress was drawn to her character's complex personality: "She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't". While Russell initially considered Lawrence to be too young for the part, she convinced him to hire her via a <a href="Skype">Skype</a> audition. The actress found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the "best experience of my life". <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote: "Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who "is", grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role." Peter Travers believed that Lawrence "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes all in the same scene, even in the same breath." She won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%2C%20Drama">Golden Globe</a> and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, becoming—at age 22—the second youngest Best Actress winner. Her final film of the year was alongside <a href="Max%20Thieriot">Max Thieriot</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20Shue">Elisabeth Shue</a> in <a href="Mark%20Tonderai">Mark Tonderai</a>'s critically panned thriller "<a href="House%20at%20the%20End%20of%20the%20Street">House at the End of the Street</a>".

In January 2013, Lawrence hosted an episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>", with musical guest <a href="The%20Lumineers">The Lumineers</a>. "<a href="The%20Devil%20You%20Know%20%28film%29">The Devil You Know</a>", a small-scale production that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, was her first release of 2013. She then reprised the role of Everdeen in "", the second installment in the <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%20series%29">"Hunger Games" film series</a>. While performing the film's underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection that resulted in a brief loss of hearing. With box office earnings of $865 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release. Stephanie Zacharek of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" believed that Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal <a href="role%20model">role model</a>, and wrote that "there's no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her". She took on a supporting role in Russell's ensemble crime drama "<a href="American%20Hustle">American Hustle</a>" (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a>). Inspired by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>'s <a href="Abscam">Abscam</a> sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen. Geoffrey Macnab of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" praised her as "funny and acerbic", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband's mistress (played by <a href="Amy%20Adams">Amy Adams</a>) on the lips. Lawrence's performance won her the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy Award</a> nomination, her first in the supporting category.

Lawrence played Serena Pemberton in <a href="Susanne%20Bier">Susanne Bier</a>'s depression-era drama "<a href="Serena%20%282014%20film%29">Serena</a>" (2014), based on the <a href="Serena%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="Ron%20Rash">Ron Rash</a>. In the film, she and her husband George (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) are a married couple who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The project was filmed in 2012, and was released in 2014 to poor reviews. Lawrence then reprised the role of Mystique in "", which served as a sequel to both "" (2006) and "X-Men: First Class" (2011). The film received positive reviews and grossed $748.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the "X-Men" series to that point. Justin Chang of "Variety" praised her look in the film but thought that she had little to do but "glower, snarl and let the <a href="visual%20effects">f/x</a> artists do their thing". Lawrence's next two releases were in the final parts of "The Hunger Games" film series", " (2014) and "" (2015). For the musical score of the former film, she sang the song "<a href="The%20Hanging%20Tree%20%28The%20Hunger%20Games%20song%29">The Hanging Tree</a>", which charted on multiple international <a href="record%20chart">singles charts</a>. In a review of the final film in the series, <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" drew similarities between her rise to stardom and Everdeen's journey as a rebel leader, writing: "Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing, partly because, like all great stars, she seems to be playing a version of her 'real' self". Both films earned more than $650 million worldwide.
Lawrence worked with Russell for the third time in the biopic "<a href="Joy%20%28film%29">Joy</a>" (2015), in which she plays the <a href="Joy%20Mangano">eponymous character</a>, a troubled single mother who becomes a successful businessperson after inventing the Miracle Mop. During production in Boston, the press reported on a disagreement between Russell and Lawrence that resulted in a "screaming match". She said that her friendship with Russell made it easier for them to disagree, because people fight when they really love each other. The film was not as well received as their previous collaborations, but her performance was praised. <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> called it "a wonderfully layered performance that carries the film through its rough spots and sometime dubious detours" that was her best since "Winter's Bone". She won a third <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award</a>, and was nominated for another Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the youngest person to accrue four Oscar nominations. Lawrence began 2016 by providing the narration for "<a href="A%20Beautiful%20Planet">A Beautiful Planet</a>", a documentary film that explores Earth from the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>. She played Mystique for the third time in "" (2016). The film received mixed reviews, with a consensus that it was overfilled with action that detracted from the story's themes and cast's performances. Helen O'Hara from "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" considered the film to be a letdown from the previous installments of the series, and criticized the actress for making her character too grim. Despite this, she was rewarded Favorite Movie Actress at the <a href="43rd%20People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">43rd People's Choice Awards</a>.

Lawrence was paid $20 million for playing Aurora Lane in the science fiction film "<a href="Passengers%20%282016%20film%29">Passengers</a>" (2016), and she received top-billing over co-star <a href="Chris%20Pratt">Chris Pratt</a>. It features Pratt and her as two people who wake up 90 years too soon from an <a href="suspended%20animation">induced hibernation</a> on a spaceship bound for a new planet. Lawrence says that she felt nervous performing her first sex scene and kissing a married man (Pratt) on screen; she drank alcohol to prepare herself for filming. Critical reaction was mixed, but Lawrence defended the film by calling it a "tainted, complicated love story". <a href="Darren%20Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s psychological horror film "<a href="Mother%21">Mother!</a>" was Lawrence's sole release of 2017. She starred as a young wife who experiences trauma when her home is invaded by unexpected guests. Lawrence spent three months rehearsing the film in a warehouse in Brooklyn, despite her reluctance to rehearsals in her previous assignments. The intense role proved difficult for her to film; she was put on supplemental oxygen when she hyperventilated one day, and she also dislocated a rib. "Mother!" polarized viewers and prompted mass walkouts. The film was better received by critics; Walter Addiego of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" labelled it "assaultive" and a "deliberate test of audience endurance", and credited Lawrence for "never allow[ing] herself to be reduced simply to a howling victim".

The following year, Lawrence starred as Dominika Egorova, a Russian spy who makes contact with a mysterious <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> agent (played by <a href="Joel%20Edgerton">Joel Edgerton</a>), in Francis Lawrence's espionage thriller "<a href="Red%20Sparrow">Red Sparrow</a>", based on Jason Matthews' <a href="Red%20Sparrow%20%28book%29">novel of the same name</a>. She learned to speak in a Russian accent and undertook <a href="ballet">ballet</a> training for four months. Lawrence was challenged by the sexuality in her role, but has said that performing the nude scenes made her feel empowered. <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>'s Eric Kohn disliked the film's denouement, but praised the work of Lawrence and <a href="Charlotte%20Rampling">Charlotte Rampling</a>, stating that "the considerable talent on display is [the film's] constant saving grace." , Lawrence's films have grossed over $5.7 billion worldwide.

Lawrence has filmed her fourth "X-Men" film, entitled "<a href="Dark%20Phoenix%20%28film%29">Dark Phoenix</a>", which is scheduled for release in June 2019. She and <a href="Amy%20Schumer">Amy Schumer</a> have written a screenplay for a film in which they will star. The actress will star in <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s film adaptation of photojournalist <a href="Lynsey%20Addario">Lynsey Addario</a>'s memoir "It's What I Do: A Photographer's Life of Love and War", and will feature as <a href="Elizabeth%20Holmes">Elizabeth Holmes</a>, founder of the <a href="Theranos">Theranos</a> blood testing company, in <a href="Adam%20McKay">Adam McKay</a>'s film "Bad Blood". Lawrence will also produce a film adaptation of Hannah Kent's novel "<a href="Burial%20Rites">Burial Rites</a>" and star as Agnes Magnúsdóttir, the last woman to be executed for murder in Iceland.

While filming "X-Men: First Class" in 2010, Lawrence began a romantic relationship with her co-star <a href="Nicholas%20Hoult">Nicholas Hoult</a>. The couple broke up around the time they wrapped "X-Men: Days of Future Past" in 2014. Also that year, she was one of the victims of the <a href="iCloud%20leaks%20of%20celebrity%20photos">iCloud leaks of celebrity photos</a> when dozens of self-photographed nude pictures of her were leaked online. Lawrence emphasized that the images were never meant to go public; she called the leak a "sex crime" and a "sexual violation". She added that viewers of the images should be ashamed of their part in a sexual offense. The actress later stated that her pictures were intended for Hoult, and that unlike other victims of the hack, she did not plan to sue <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> In September 2016, she began dating director Darren Aronofsky, whom she met during the filming of "<a href="mother%21">mother!</a>". The couple split in November 2017. In 2018, she began dating Cooke Maroney, an art gallery director, and the couple became engaged in February 2019.

Lawrence is a supporter of <a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>, and participated in a June 2017 video against the defunding of the organization. She spoke out against the November 2015 shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic. She is a <a href="feminism">feminist</a>, a concept she argues should not intimidate people "because it just means equality". Lawrence promotes <a href="body%20positivity">body positivity</a> among women. In 2015, she wrote an essay for the "<a href="Lenny%20Letter">Lenny Letter</a>" in which she criticized the <a href="gender%20pay%20gap">gender pay gap</a> in Hollywood. She wrote about her own experiences in the industry, such as the lesser salary she received for her work in "American Hustle" compared to her male co-stars. In a 2015 interview with "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>", Lawrence criticized Kentucky county clerk <a href="Kim%20Davis">Kim Davis</a> for her opposition to <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>. Lawrence was "raised a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>", but has subsequently criticized the party's stance on women's rights. She has strongly opposed <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>'s presidency, stating in 2015 that his election would "be the end of the world". Lawrence participated in the <a href="2018%20Women%27s%20March">2018 Women's March</a> in Los Angeles to affirm her commitment to women's rights.

Lawrence became a member of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> in 2011. She has lent her support to several charitable organizations, such as the <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a>, <a href="Feeding%20America">Feeding America</a>, and the <a href="Thirst%20Project">Thirst Project</a>. Along with <a href="Josh%20Hutcherson">Josh Hutcherson</a> and <a href="Liam%20Hemsworth">Liam Hemsworth</a>, her co-stars of "The Hunger Games" (2012), Lawrence partnered with the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> to publicize poverty and hunger. She organized an early screening of "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" (2013) to benefit Saint Mary's Center, a disabilities organization in Louisville, and raised more than $40,000 for the cause. She partnered with the charity broadcast network Chideo to raise funds for the <a href="2015%20Special%20Olympics%20World%20Summer%20Games">2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games</a> by screening her film "Serena" (2014). She also collaborated with <a href="Omaze">Omaze</a> to host a fundraising contest for the games as part of the premiere of "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1" (2014).

In 2015, Lawrence teamed with Hutcherson and Hemsworth for "Prank It FWD", a charitable initiative to raise money for the non-profit organization <a href="Do%20Something">Do Something</a>. That year, she also launched the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation, which supports charities such as the <a href="Boys%20%26amp%3B%20Girls%20Clubs%20of%20America">Boys & Girls Clubs of America</a> and the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>. In 2016, she donated $2 million to the <a href="Kosair%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Kosair Children's Hospital</a> in Louisville to set up a cardiac intensive care unit named after her foundation. Lawrence is a board member of <a href="Represent.Us">Represent.Us</a>, a nonprofit seeking to pass anti-corruption laws in the United States. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. Also that year, Lawrence announced her commitment to get young Americans politically engaged and to advocate for anti-corruption laws.

In 2012, the review website IndieWire stated Lawrence had a "down-to-earth, self-deprecating, unaffected" personality. An <a href="IGN">IGN</a> writer considers her to be a "sharp", "funny" and "quirky" actress who likes to "stay grounded" despite considerable success. Lawrence says that she finds acting "stupid" and does not believe in being "cocky" about her success.

In 2012, "Rolling Stone" called her "the most talented young actress in America." Her "Hunger Games" co-star <a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a> has favorably compared her craft to that of <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and considers her an "exquisite and brilliant actor". David O. Russell (who directed her in "Silver Linings Playbook", "American Hustle" and "Joy") has praised her effortless acting that makes her performances look easy. During her career, Lawrence has played roles in both high-profile, mainstream productions and low-budget independent films, and has appeared in a range of film genres. She did not study acting and has not been involved in professional theater. She instead bases her acting approach on her observations of people around her. The actress told "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" in June 2010 that she does not "invest any of my real emotions" or take home any pains of her characters. Lawrence went on to say that "I don't even take it to <a href="craft%20service">craft service</a>s" and has never shared their experiences, relying instead on her imagination, noting "I can't go around looking for roles that are exactly like my life." She stated that "If it ever came down to the point where, to make a part better, I had to lose a little bit of my sanity, I wouldn't do it. I would just do comedies."

As her career has developed, Lawrence has become one of the best paid actresses; "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" reported in 2014 that she was earning $10 million a film. In 2013, "Time" magazine named her <a href="Time%20100">one of the most 100 influential people in the world</a>, "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" labeled her the most powerful woman in the entertainment business, and "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" ranked her as the 50th most powerful actress. In 2014, "Forbes" named her the second-highest-paid actress in the world with earnings of $34 million, and cited her as the most powerful actress, ranking at number 12 in the magazine's <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> list; she appeared in the list again in 2016. In 2015, Lawrence was named "Entertainer of the Year" by "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"—a title she also won in 2012—and was recognized as the highest-grossing action heroine in "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" for starring in the "Hunger Games" series. In 2015 and 2016, "Forbes" reported that she had emerged as the world's highest-paid actress with annual earnings of $52 million and $46 million, respectively. The magazine ranked her as the world's third and fourth highest-paid actress during the next two years, with respective earnings of $24 million and $18 million.

Lawrence appeared in <a href="Victoria%27s%20Secret">Victoria's Secret</a>'s listing of the "Sexiest Up-and-Coming Bombshell" in 2011, "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" Most Beautiful People in 2011 and 2013, "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" Hot 100 from 2011 to 2014, and topped "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>" <a href="FHM%27s%20100%20Sexiest%20Women%20%28UK%29">sexiest women in the world</a> list in 2014. From 2013 to 2015, she was featured in "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour</a>" annual listing of the best dressed women, topping the list in 2014.

Lawrence won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in "Silver Linings Playbook" (2012). She has won three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s; Best Actress – Comedy or Musical for "Silver Linings Playbook" (2012) and "Joy" (2015), and Best Supporting Actress for "American Hustle" (2013).

The Slave Community

The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South is a book written by American <a href="historian">historian</a> <a href="John%20Wesley%20Blassingame">John W. Blassingame</a>. Published in 1972, it is one of the first historical studies of <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery in the United States</a> to be presented from the perspective of the enslaved. "The Slave Community" contradicted those historians who had interpreted history to suggest that <a href="African%20American">African American</a> slaves were docile and submissive "<a href="%23Personality%20types">Sambos</a>" who enjoyed the benefits of a <a href="paternalism">paternalistic</a> master-slave relationship on <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern</a> <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a>s. Using psychology, Blassingame analyzes <a href="slave%20narrative">fugitive slave narratives</a> published in the 19th century to conclude that an independent culture developed among the enslaved and that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves.

Although the importance of "The Slave Community" was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the <a href="Association%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20African%20American%20Life%20and%20History">Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History</a> and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of "The Slave Community". Despite criticisms, "The Slave Community" is a foundational text in the study of the life and culture of slaves in the <a href="Antebellum%20era">antebellum South</a>.

<a href="Ulrich%20Bonnell%20Phillips">Ulrich Bonnell Phillips</a> wrote the first major historical study of the 20th century dealing with slavery. In "American Negro Slavery" (1918), Phillips refers to slaves as "<a href="negro">negro</a>es, who for the most part were by racial quality submissive rather than defiant, light-hearted instead of gloomy, amiable and ingratiating instead of sullen, and whose very defects invited paternalism rather than repression." "American Negro Slavery" is infused with racial rhetoric and upholds perceptions about the inferiority of black people common in the <a href="southern%20United%20States">southern United States</a> at the time. Although African American academics such as <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> criticized Phillips's depiction of slaves, the book was considered the authoritative text on slavery in America until the 1950s.

Phillips's interpretation of slavery was challenged by <a href="Kenneth%20M.%20Stampp">Kenneth M. Stampp</a> in "The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South" (1956) and <a href="Stanley%20Elkins">Stanley M. Elkins</a> in "Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life" (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in "American Negro Slavery" and approaches the issue from the position that there is no innate difference between blacks and whites. He questions the reality of plantation paternalism described by Phillips: "the reality of ante-bellum paternalism ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed." Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim that <a href="African%20American%20slaves">African American slaves</a> were innately submissive "Sambos". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or "made" into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of <a href="Jews">Jews</a> in <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>.

Like Phillips, Stampp and Elkins relied on plantation records and the writings of slaveowners as their main <a href="primary%20source">primary source</a>s. Stampp admits that "few ask what the slaves themselves thought of bondage." Historians dismissed the written works of slaves such as the 19th century fugitive slave narratives as unreliable and biased because of their editing by <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionists</a>. Scholars also ignored the 2,300 interviews conducted with former slaves in the late 1930s by the WPA <a href="Federal%20Writers%27%20Project">Federal Writers' Project</a>. As historian <a href="George%20Rawick">George P. Rawick</a> points out, more weight was often given to white sources: the "masters not only ruled the past in fact" but also "rule its <a href="recorded%20history">written history</a>."

The 1970s, however, witnessed the publication of revisionist studies that departed from the traditional <a href="Historiography%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Slavery">historiography of slavery</a>. Focusing on the perspective of the slave, new studies incorporated the slave narratives and WPA interviews: George Rawick's "From Sunup to Sundown: The Making of the Black Community" (1972), <a href="Eugene%20D.%20Genovese">Eugene D. Genovese</a>'s "Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made" (1974), <a href="Peter%20H.%20Wood">Peter H. Wood</a>, "Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 Through the Stono Rebellion" (1974), Leslie Howard Owens's "This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South" (1976), <a href="Herbert%20G.%20Gutman">Herbert G. Gutman</a>'s "The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925" (1976), and <a href="Lawrence%20W.%20Levine">Lawrence W. Levine</a>'s "Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom" (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's "The Slave Community".

In "The Slave Community", Blassingame argues that "historians have never systematically explored the life experiences of American slaves." He asserts that by concentrating on the slaveowner, historians have presented a distorted view of plantation life that "strips the slave of any meaningful and distinctive culture, family life, religion, or manhood." Blassingame outlines that the reliance on planter sources led historians like Elkins to mimic planter stereotypes of slaves such as the "submissive half-man, half child" Sambo. Noting the <a href="Agency%20%28philosophy%29">agency</a> slaves possessed over their lives, he contends, "Rather than identifying with and submitting totally to his master, the slave held onto many remnants of his <a href="Culture%20of%20Africa">African culture</a>, gained a sense of worth in the quarters, spent most of his time free from surveillance by whites, controlled important aspects of his life, and did some personally meaningful things on his own volition."

According to Blassingame, African culture was not entirely removed from slave culture through the process of enslavement and "was much more resistant to the bludgeons that was slavery than historians have hitherto suspected." "African survivals" persisted in the form of folk tales, religion and spirituality, music and dance, and language. He asserts that the retention of African culture acted as a form of resistance to enslavement: "All things considered, the few Africans enslaved in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America appear to have survived their traumatic experiences without becoming abjectly docile, infantile, or submissive" and "since an overwhelming percentage of nineteenth-century Southern slaves were native Americans, they never underwent this kind of shock [the <a href="Middle%20Passage">Middle Passage</a>] and were in a position to construct psychological defenses against total dependency on their masters."

Blassingame asserts that historians have discussed "what could be generally described as slave 'culture,' but give little solid information on life in the quarters." He argues that culture developed within the slave community independent of the slaveowners' influence. Blassingame notes, "<a href="Antebellum%20era">Antebellum</a> black slaves created several unique cultural forms which lightened their burden of oppression, promoted group solidarity, provided ways for verbalizing aggression, sustaining hope, building self-esteem, and often represented areas of life largely free from the control of whites."

Blassingame notes that many of the folk tales told by slaves have been traced by African scholars to <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, and <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> to peoples such as the <a href="Ewe%20people">Ewe</a>, <a href="Wolof%20people">Wolof</a>, <a href="Hausa%20people">Hausa</a>, <a href="Temne%20people">Temne</a>, <a href="Ashanti%20people">Ashanti</a>, and <a href="Igbo%20people">Igbo</a>. He remarks, "While many of these tales were brought over to the South, the African element appears most clearly in the animal tales." One prominent example discussed by Blassingame is the Ewe story of "Why the Hare Runs Away", which is a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> and <a href="tar%20baby">tar-baby tale</a> told by southern slaves and later recorded by writer <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a> in his <a href="Uncle%20Remus">Uncle Remus</a> stories. Southern slaves often included African animals like elephants, lions, and monkeys as characters in their folk tales.

As Christian missionaries and slaveowners attempted to erase African religious and spiritual beliefs, Blassingame argues that "in the United States, many African religious rites were <a href="syncretism">fused</a> into one—<a href="Louisiana%20Voodoo">voodoo</a>." Voodoo priests and conjurers promised slaves that they could make masters kind, harm enemies, ensure love, and heal sickness. Other religious survivals noted by Blassingame include funeral rites, grave decorating, and ritualistic dancing and singing.

Slaveowners and state governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical instruments because of the use of drums to signal the <a href="Stono%20Rebellion">Stono Rebellion</a> in 1739. Blassingame, however, points out that in spite of restrictions, slaves were able to build a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances were similar to those performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, gourd rattles, and <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>s.

Still, Blassingame concludes that cross-cultural exchanges occurred on southern plantations, arguing that "<a href="acculturation">acculturation</a> in the United States involved the mutual interaction between two cultures, with Europeans and Africans borrowing from each other." Blassingame asserts that the most significant instance revolved around <a href="Protestantism">Protestant Christianity</a> (primarily <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> and <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> churches): "The number of blacks who received religious instruction in antebellum white churches is significant because the church was the only institution other than the plantation which played a major role in acculturating the slave." Christianity and enslaved black ministers slowly replaced African religious survivals and represented another aspect of slave culture which the slaves used to create their own communities. While ministers preached obedience in the presence of the slaveowners and other whites, slaves often met in secret, "invisible" services unsupervised by whites. In these "<a href="Invisible%20Churches%20%28Slavery%29">invisible churches</a>", slaves could discuss freedom, liberty, and the <a href="Divine%20Judgment">judgment</a> of <a href="God">God</a> against slaveowners.

Slave marriages were illegal in southern states, and slave couples were frequently separated by slaveowners through sale. Blassingame grants that slaveowners did have control over slave marriages. They encouraged monogamous relationships to "make it easier to discipline their slaves. ... A black man, they reasoned, who loved his wife and his children was less likely to be rebellious or to run away than would a 'single' slave." Blassingame notes that when a slave couple resided on the same plantation, the husband witnessed the whipping and raping of his wife and the sale of his children. He remarks, "Nothing demonstrated his powerlessness as much as the slave's inability to prevent the forcible sale of his wife and children."

Nevertheless, Blassingame argues that "however frequently the family was broken it was primarily responsible for the slave's ability to survive on the plantation without becoming totally dependent on and submissive to his master." He contends:

Blassingame asserts that slave parents attempted to shield infants and young children from the brutality of the plantation. When children understood that they were enslaved (usually after their first whipping), parents dissuaded angry urges to run away or seek revenge.

Children observed fathers demonstrating two behavioral types. In the quarters, he "acted like a man", castigating whites for the mistreatment of himself and his family; in the field working for the master, he appeared obedient and submissive. According to Blassingame, "Sometimes children internalized both the true personality traits and the contradictory behavioral patterns of their parents." He believes that children recognized submissiveness as a convenient method to avoid punishment and the behavior in the quarters as the true behavioral model. Blassingame concludes, "In [the slave father's] family, the slave not only learned how to avoid the blows of the master, but also drew on the love and sympathy of its members to raise his spirits. The family was, in short, an important survival mechanism."

Blassingame identifies three stereotypes in the literature of the antebellum south:
Directly challenging Elkins's infantilization thesis, Blassingame argues that historians have focused too much on the Sambo <a href="personality%20type">personality type</a> and the role of paternalism. "The Sambo stereotype was so pervasive in antebellum Southern literature that many historians, without further research, argue that it was an accurate description of the dominant slave personality."

According to Blassingame, the Sambo figure evolved from white Americans' attitudes toward Africans and African Americans as innately barbaric, passive, superstitious, and childlike. Southern writers felt a need to defend slavery from allegations of abuse and brutality leveled by northern abolitionists, so Sambo became a common portrayal to justify and explain the need for plantation paternalism. Finally, slaveowners used the Sambo stereotype to alleviate their own fears and anxieties about the potential rebelliousness of their slaves. Blassingame remarks, "In this regard, Nat, the actual and potential rebel, stands at the core of white perceptions of the slave. With Nat perennially in the wings, the creation of Sambo was almost mandatory for the Southerner's emotional security. Like a man whistling in the dark to bolster his courage, the white man "had" to portray the slave as Sambo."

Despite slaveowner paternalism and charges of submissiveness, Blassingame contends, "There is overwhelming evidence, in the primary sources, of the Negro's resistance to his bondage and of his undying love for freedom." Blassingame outlines efforts of slaves to run away and rebel, particularly the Stono Rebellion of 1739, <a href="Charles%20Deslondes">Charles Deslondes</a>'s revolt in 1811, Nat Turner's revolt of 1831, and the participation of fugitive slaves in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> fighting with <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>s during the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a>. Blassingame concludes that the Sambo and Nat stereotypes "were real." He explains, "The more fear whites had of Nat, the more firmly tried to believe in Sambo in order to escape paranoia."

Blassingame concludes that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves positioned on a scale between the two extremes of Sambo and Nat. He argues that variations present in plantations, overseers, and masters gave the slave "much more freedom from restraint and more independence and autonomy than his institutionally defined role allowed. Consequently, the slave did not have to be infantile or abjectly docile in order to remain alive." Blassingame compares slavery on southern plantations to the treatment of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps in an effort to demonstrate that "the most important factor in causing infantilism, total dependency, and docility in the camps was the real threat of death which left few, if any, alternatives for the inmates." He remarks, "Placed on a continuum of <a href="total%20institution">total institution</a>s, the concentration camp is far removed from the Southern plantation." According to Blassingame, the goal of the irrationally organized and understaffed plantation was not the systematic torture and extermination of its laborers, who were "worth more than a bullet".

In "The Slave Community", Blassingame uses <a href="psychology">psychologist</a> <a href="Harry%20Stack%20Sullivan">Harry Stack Sullivan</a>'s <a href="Interpersonal%20psychoanalysis">interpersonal theory</a> to interpret the behavior of slaves on antebellum plantations. Sullivan claims that "significant others", persons with the most power to reward and punish individual behavior, were primarily responsible for determining behavior. Interpersonal theorists argue that "behavioral patterns are determined by the characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time." The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, "Our sense of self-esteem is heightened or lowered by our perception of the images others have of us." Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: "One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs."

Another psychological theory used by Blassingame is <a href="role%20theory">role theory</a>. According to this theory, "a person's behavior is generally determined by the socially defined roles or the behavioral patterns expected of him in certain situations." Blassingame asserts that through applying interpersonal and role theory to the fugitive slave narratives, historians can determine "the extent to which slaves acted the way their masters expected them to behave" and how the Sambo, Jack, and Nat personality types can be misleading.

Blassingame contends that historians have "deliberately ignored" autobiographies of ex-slaves, particularly the fugitive slave narratives. "Consequently", argues Blassingame, "a great deal of emphasis has been placed on non-traditional sources in this study in an effort to delineate more clearly the slave's view of bondage and to discover some new insights into the workings of the system." He relies heavily on narratives by <a href="Henry%20Bibb">Henry Bibb</a>, Henry Clay Bruce, <a href="Elizabeth%20Keckley">Elizabeth Keckley</a>, Samuel Hall, <a href="Solomon%20Northup">Solomon Northup</a>, <a href="Charles%20Ball">Charles Ball</a>, <a href="Jermain%20Wesley%20Loguen">Jermain Wesley Loguen</a>, <a href="William%20Wells%20Brown">William Wells Brown</a>, <a href="John%20Brown%20%28fugitive%20slave%29">John Brown</a>, Robert Anderson, William Grimes, <a href="Austin%20Steward">Austin Steward</a>, and <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>. Blassingame's discussion of the <a href="African%20slave%20trade">African slave trade</a>, Middle Passage, and African culture is based on <a href="Olaudah%20Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a>'s "The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African" (1794).

Rather than accepting the fugitive slave narratives without question, Blassingame admits to scrutinizing his reading of the texts. He notes that arguments against the use of these autobiographies used by historians revolve around reliability: "Many historians refuse to use these accounts because they have felt the fugitive, as the primary sufferer in the institution, was unable to give an objective account of bondage." Still, Blassingame defends his reliance on autobiographies, noting, "The portrait of the institution of slavery which emerges from the narratives is not the simple picture of <a href="hell">hell</a> on earth that most historians have led us to believe they contain. Instead, the fugitives' plantations are peopled with the same range of heroes and villains, black and white, which one generally finds in the human race." Therefore, Blassingame concludes:

Besides fugitive slave narratives, Blassingame uses abolitionist periodicals such as "<a href="The%20Liberator%20%28anti-slavery%20newspaper%29">The Liberator</a>", "<a href="National%20Anti-Slavery%20Standard">National Anti-Slavery Standard</a>", "<a href="National%20Enquirer%20%281836%29">Pennsylvania Freeman</a>", "Anti-Slavery Bugle", and "<a href="Genius%20of%20Universal%20Emancipation">Genius of Universal Emancipation</a>". According to Blassingame, these periodicals printed slave interviews, letters, and autobiographies, but "gave even more coverage to white Southerners than to slaves and frequently reprinted articles, letters, and proceedings from a large number of Southern newspapers".

A primary source that Blassingame did not consult in his study was the WPA slave interviews. While he admits that "slave interviews rival autobiographies in their revelations about the internal dynamics of bondage, ... the heavy editing of the WPA interviews makes them far more difficult to utilize than black autobiographies." He elaborates on his criticism of the interviews in a 1975 article in the "Journal of Southern History". He describes how white interviewers often deleted material contrary to the paternalistic image of the antebellum South which they wanted to present. Blassingame concludes, "Uncritical use of the interviews will lead almost inevitably to a simplistic and distorted view of the plantation as a paternalistic institution where the chief feature of life was mutual love and respect between masters and slaves."

Blassingame builds on the historiography of Phillips, Stampp, and Elkins, but he acknowledges the influence of Charles S. Sydnor's "Slavery in Mississippi" (1933), Orville W. Taylor's "Negro Slavery in Arkansas" (1958), Eugene D. Genovese's "The Political Economy of Slavery" (1961), and Ann J. Lane's anthology of essays "The Debate Over Slavery: Stanley Elkins and His Critics" (1971).

The importance of "The Slave Community" as one of the first studies of slavery from the perspective of the slave was recognized by historians. The book nonetheless received heavy criticism by academics who disagreed with Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources. Historian George P. Rawick noted in 1976, however, that the criticism "should not obscure the fact that [Blassingame's] book was of such merit as to warrant spending our time criticizing it four years after its publication. Yet, like many good books, it should have been better."

In "The History Teacher", Keith Polakoff comments that "only with the publication of Blassingame's work do we obtain for the first time a detailed examination of the daily lives of the slaves on large plantations, with some intelligent speculation about the forces to which they were subjected. David Goldfield writes in "Agricultural History" that the book was the most impressive and balanced attempt to understand the slave's responses to plantation life to date. <a href="Carl%20N.%20Degler">Carl N. Degler</a> writes in the "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" that Blassingame's study comes "closer than any previous study to answering the question 'what was it like to be a slave?'"

Still, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources received substantial criticism from historians. Marian DeB. Kilson's review in the "<a href="American%20Historical%20Review">American Historical Review</a>" described Blassingame's aims as "imperfectly realized" because he "lacks a clear analytical perspective". She found his discussion of slave personality types "fascinating" and "his methodological aims ... important" but "not systematically pursued". Kilson believes that Blassingame ultimately failed in his analysis because "his intellectual integration of social and psychological orientations has yet to be fully achieved." Orville W. Taylor contends in the "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20Negro%20History">Journal of Negro History</a>" that Blassingame had a tendency to overgeneralize and make "unsubstantiatable claims to originality and uniqueness".

In the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Political%20Economy">Journal of Political Economy</a>", <a href="economic%20history">economic historian</a> <a href="Stanley%20L.%20Engerman">Stanley L. Engerman</a> complains that the book is not "written by or for <a href="economist">economist</a>s" and makes "limited use of economic analysis". He continues, "Given the concern with the 'personal autonomy' and culture of the slave, much of the book is devoted to the African heritage; to slave music, religion, and folklore; and to the discussion of the slave family and other personal relationships." Engerman concedes that "The Slave Community" "is a book written at a time of transition in the interpretation of slavery and black culture", but "the author at times seems unsure of the direction in which he is pointing." He concludes that Blassingame's "analysis is incomplete in its presentation of a different and more complex scene" even though he "effectively shows the difficulties of the concentration-camp image and the Sambo myth".

Historians criticized Blassingame for dismissing the WPA slave interviews and relying solely on fugitive slave narratives. In the "<a href="Journal%20of%20American%20History">Journal of American History</a>", <a href="Willie%20Lee%20Rose">Willie Lee Rose</a> writes that Blassingame's use of the fugitive slave narratives is marred by his neglect of the WPA interviews. Kenneth Wiggins Porter regards Blassingame's dependence on printed sources as a "major weakness" and believes he does not use enough white sources like plantation records and travel narratives, particularly <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a>'s account of life in the antebellum South. According to George Rawick, "We desperately need work that depicts and analyzes the lives of black women under slavery. We have had very largely a male-dominated literature about slavery." He notes, "Blassingame, unfortunately, does not help us at all in this task." Rawick surmises that if Blassingame had consulted the WPA slave interviews, he would have developed a picture of the "heroic struggles of black women on behalf of themselves and of the whole black community".

Historians exhibited varying responses to Blassingame's use of psychological theory. In a review in the "William and Mary Quarterly", George Mullin is especially critical of Blassingame's use of psychology, stating that Blassingame "reduc[es] slave behavior and culture to a question of roles and psychological characteristics". He concludes that an "<a href="E.%20P.%20Thompson">E. P. Thompson</a> for the American Black community during slavery is still off-stage", and that the topic needs exploration by a <a href="social%20history">social</a> or economic historian. Rawick states that Blassingame's "first major error lies in adopting the very questionable deterministic social psychological role theories associated with ... Irving Goffman and Henry Stack Sullivan." He complains that it "parodies the basic complexity of the 'psychology' of the oppressed who simultaneously view themselves in socially negative terms while struggling against the view of themselves and their behavior". Rawick is convinced that Blassingame would have reached the same conclusions from the sources without the use of psychology "because the historical evidence as seen through an unadulterated commitment to the struggles of the slaves and an equally uncompromising hostility to the masters would have led him there." On the other hand, Eugene D. Genovese and Earl E. Thorpe praised Blassingame for his use of psychological theory, but admit they prefer <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> and <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> interpretations over Sullivanian theory.

In 1976, the <a href="Association%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20African%20American%20Life%20and%20History">Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History</a> met in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and held a session on "The Slave Community". Panelists included <a href="Mary%20Frances%20Berry">Mary Frances Berry</a>, Herbert Gutman, Leslie Howard Owens, George Rawick, Earl Thorpe, and Eugene Genovese. Blassingame responded to questions and critiques from the panel. The discussion led to the publication of an anthology edited by Al-Tony Gilmore called "Revisiting Blassingame's" The Slave Community": The Scholars Respond" (1978). The book includes essays by the panelists as well as James D. Anderson, Ralph D. Carter, <a href="John%20Henrik%20Clarke">John Henrik Clarke</a>, and Stanley Engerman. Blassingame's essay, "Redefining "The Slave Community": A Response to Critics" appears in the volume.

Since its publication in 1972 and revision in 1979, "The Slave Community" has influenced subsequent historiographical works on slavery in the United States. In a 1976 edition of "Roll, Jordan, Roll", Eugene Genovese explains that Blassingame's book "demonstrates that the published accounts of runaway slaves can be illuminating". The authors of "Reckoning with Slavery" (1976) use Blassingame's findings to challenge the assertions of <a href="Robert%20Fogel">Robert William Fogel</a> and Stanley Engerman in "" (1974). In "Slave Religion: The "Invisible Institution" in the Antebellum South" (1978), <a href="Albert%20J.%20Raboteau">Albert J. Raboteau</a> comments, "We should speak of the 'invisibility' of slave religion with irony: it is the neglect of slave sources by historians which has been the main cause of this invisibility." Raboteau credits Blassingame and others for demonstrating the value of slave sources. Historian Charles Joyner's influential study "Down by the Riverside: A South Carolina Slave Community" (1984) is reinforced by the findings of "The Slave Community" and relies on similar evidence.

Historian Deborah Gray White builds on Blassingame's research of the family life of the slaves in "Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South" (1985). Her argument is similar to Blassingame's: "This present study takes a look at slave women in America and argues that they were not submissive, subordinate, or prudish and that they were not expected to be so." White discusses the <a href="Mammy%20archetype">Mammy</a> and <a href="Jezebel%20%28Bible%29%23Jezebel%20in%20modern%20culture">Jezebel</a> stereotypes often applied to African American women by white Americans. She calls "The Slave Community" "a classic" but remarks that "Blassingame stressed the fact that many masters recognized the male as the head of the family. He observed that during courtship men flattered women and exaggerated their prowess. There was, however, little discussion of the reciprocal activities of slave women." She concludes that Blassingame "described how slave men gained status in the family, but he did not do the same for women."

<a href="Elizabeth%20Fox-Genovese">Elizabeth Fox-Genovese</a> makes similar observations in "Within the Plantation Household: Black and White Women of the Old South" (1988). She notes that "The Slave Community", like other historiography produced in the 1960s and 70s, "did not directly address <a href="feminist%20history">women's history</a>, even though many of the historians were sensitive to women's experience. Most of the male authors had done a large part of their work before the development of women's history as a discipline, and even the most sensitive were hampered by a paucity of sources and by unfamiliarity with the questions <a href="feminism">feminists</a> would soon raise."

After the 1976 Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History meeting and the publication of "Revisiting Blassingame's" The Slave Community in 1978, Blassingame produced a revised and enlarged edition of "The Slave Community" in 1979. In the new preface, Blassingame asserted that the book had to be revised because of George Bentley, an enslaved, <a href="Pro-Slavery%20Thought%20in%20the%20Old%20South">pro-slavery</a> <a href="Primitive%20Baptist">Primitive Baptist</a> minister from <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> who pastored a white church in the 1850s. Blassingame wanted to "solve the myriad dilemmas posed by George Bentley", but he also wanted to answer the questions, challenges, and critiques raised by scholars since the publication of "The Slave Community".

Blassingame explains that he incorporated the suggestions published in "Revisiting Blassingame's" The Slave Community "without long protestation or argument". The most significant changes made to the text involve further discussion of African cultural survivals, slave family life, slave culture, and acculturation. Blassingame added a chapter titled "The Americanization of the Slave and the Africanization of the South" where he draws parallels between the acculturation of African American slaves in the American South, African slaves in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, and European slaves in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. He compares the conversion of slaves in the southern states to Protestant Christianity, European slaves in North Africa to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, and African slaves in Latin America to <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholicism</a>.

Blassingame addresses the historiography of slavery published between 1972 and 1978 in the revised edition. For instance, he challenges Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman's economic and statistical study of slavery in "Time on the Cross". Blassingame writes:

Reviewing the revised edition in the "Journal of Southern History", Gary B. Mills suggests, "All controversy and revision aside, "The Slave Community" remains a significant book, and the author's position that the bulk of both slaves and slaveowners lay between the stereotyped extremes proves durable. Their exact location on a scale of one to ten will always remain a matter of opinion."

Oswald Watt

Walter Oswald Watt, (11 February 1878 – 21 May 1921) was an Australian aviator and businessman. The son of a Scottish-Australian merchant and politician, he was born in England and moved to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> when he was one year old, returning to Britain at the age of eleven for education at <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. In 1900 he went back to Australia and enlisted in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a>, before acquiring cattle <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">stations</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. He was also a partner in the family shipping firm.

The first Australian to qualify for a <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a> flying certificate, in 1911, Watt joined the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a> as a pilot on the outbreak of World War I. He transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) in 1916, quickly progressing from <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> with <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> in Egypt to <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. By February 1918, he had been promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and taken command of the AFC's <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">1st Training Wing</a> in England.

A recipient of France's <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> and <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>, and twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> during the war, Watt was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1919. He left the military to pursue business interests in Australia, and was lauded for his generosity to other returned airmen. In 1921, at the age of forty-three, he died by accidental drowning at <a href="Bilgola%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bilgola Beach</a>, New South Wales. He is commemorated by the <a href="Oswald%20Watt%20Gold%20Medal">Oswald Watt Gold Medal</a> for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>.

Born on 11 February 1878 in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, England, Oswald Watt was the youngest son of <a href="John%20Watt%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Brown Watt</a>, a Scot who had migrated to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in 1842 and became a successful merchant and politician, frequently representing his state on overseas missions. Oswald's Australian-born mother, Mary Jane, died when he was one and shortly afterwards the family relocated to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Oswald was sent back to England at the age of eleven to complete his schooling at <a href="Clifton%20College">Clifton College</a>, <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, before going on to study at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he received a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in 1899. Returning to Sydney in 1900, he was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Scottish%20Regiment">New South Wales Scottish Rifles</a>, a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> unit, and in 1902 was appointed an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>. On 27 September that year, he married Muriel Williams at St. John's Anglican Church in <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a>, Victoria; the couple had one son.
Watt's family was wealthy, and he was able to establish himself as a <a href="Pastoral%20farming">grazier</a> by purchasing several cattle <a href="station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">stations</a> in New South Wales and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Travelling abroad again, he obtained his <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29">Master of Arts</a> degree from Cambridge in 1904. In October the following year he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in the Scottish Rifles. On a subsequent trip to England he took flying lessons at the <a href="Bristol%20Aeroplane%20Company">Bristol aviation school</a> on <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>, where his fellow students included <a href="Eric%20Harrison%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Eric Harrison</a>. Watt attained his <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a> certificate, no. 112, on 1 August 1911, becoming the first Australian citizen so qualified. Upon his return to Australia later that year, he publicly declared that the time was "rapidly approaching when an aero corps [would] have to be inaugurated" as part of the country's "military defence scheme".

In March 1912, Watt recommended a location in Canberra near the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, as a base for the Army's proposed <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>. Owing to its altitude and nearby mountainous terrain, the site was rejected by the school's nominated commanding officer, Lieutenant <a href="Henry%20Petre">Henry Petre</a>. Petre eventually chose 297 hectares at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, an area suitable for seaplanes as well as land-based aircraft, to become the "birthplace of Australian military aviation". Watt also advocated manufacturing foreign-designed aircraft under licence in Australia, but this would not be pursued until after World War I. In 1913 he was divorced on the grounds of "misconduct" with actress Ivy Schilling, and lost custody of his son in the judgment. He then went to Egypt, where he purchased and practised flying a <a href="Bl%C3%A9riot%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXI">Blériot XI</a> monoplane; while there he met leading French aviators <a href="Louis%20Bl%C3%A9riot">Louis Blériot</a> and <a href="Roland%20Garros%20%28aviator%29">Roland Garros</a>.

In May 1914, the <a href="francophile">francophile</a> Watt left Egypt with his aeroplane and took up employment at the <a href="Bl%C3%A9riot%20A%C3%A9ronautique">Blériot</a> factory and airfield in <a href="Buc%2C%20Yvelines">Buc</a>, outside Paris. Fired by the widely held conviction that Britain would stay out of a European conflict, Watt offered his services and his plane to the French government on 2 August, the day <a href="World%20War%20I">France declared war on Germany</a>. This gesture was welcomed and he joined the Aviation Militaire section of the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">Foreign Legion</a> as a pilot. Though he was ranked an ordinary soldier, his colleagues in Bleriot Squadron No. 30 referred to him as ""Capitaine"" in deference to his previous status in the Australian Militia. Posted to <a href="Farman%20Aviation%20Works">Maurice Farman</a> Squadron No. 44 in April 1915, he earned the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> badge after he and his observer crash-landed in <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> and succeeded in making their way back to French lines with valuable intelligence under intense fire from German positions. Soon afterwards, Watt was awarded the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>—with palm leaves personally presented by General <a href="Joseph%20Joffre">Joffre</a>—and promoted to the provisional rank of captain. As a foreigner, however, he was not eligible to command a French unit. Watt always proclaimed his <a href="Antipodes">antipodean</a> connection while serving France, painting a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a> on the nose of his plane, which he named "Advance Australia". Considered a no-nonsense type, he once introduced himself to a British pilot with the words "I am an Australian and I haven't got any manners".
The French recognised that Watt's talents were not being fully utilised due to his ineligibility to lead a squadron, and recommended that he transfer to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>. Watt did so on 1 March 1916, with the rank of captain. Posted to Egypt in May, he was made commander of B Flight, <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>, and took charge of the unit's first contingent of <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a>s the following month. No. 1 Squadron was engaged mainly in <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a> and <a href="Close%20air%20support">army co-operation</a> duties, but the two-seat B.E.2 proved inferior to German <a href="Fokker">Fokker</a>s and <a href="Rumpler">Rumpler</a>s in speed, time-to-climb, and manoeuvrability. In September 1916, Watt was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> and given command of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, which was formed in <a href="El-Qantarah%20el-Sharqiyya">Kantara</a>. He was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> by General <a href="Archibald%20Murray">Archibald Murray</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a>, on 13 October; the commendation was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 1 December. No. 2 Squadron's personnel was composed largely of former <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Lighthorsemen</a>, as well as thirteen mechanics from the Australian Flying Corps' first combat formation, the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Half%20Flight">Mesopotamian Half Flight</a>, led by Flight Sergeant <a href="George%20Mackinolty">George Mackinolty</a>. Watt personally trained the force in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying it to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> that September. He was "a born leader of men", according to one officer, while another recalled that "In the things that mattered, his men knew he stood for absolute obedience. They also knew that when discipline could be safely relaxed he would be quick to grant them some relief from the strain."
In the vicinity of <a href="Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a> on 2 October, No. 2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape. Because the <a href="Airco%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDH.5">Airco DH.5</a>s in the squadron were handicapped as <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in <a href="Close%20air%20support">ground support</a> duties. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a> that commenced on 20 November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high. After visiting the squadron, the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>' Major General <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Trenchard">Hugh Trenchard</a> described its airmen as "really magnificent" while <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, war correspondent and future editor of the "<a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918</a>", commented on their "remarkably high level of conduct and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for gallantry during the battle, prompting General <a href="William%20Birdwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Birdwood">Sir William Birdwood</a> to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16 December, declaring: "... This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one of which I am sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; I doubt if it has been beaten anywhere ..." By this time, No. 2 Squadron had begun converting to <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather. Watt himself, now almost forty, was beginning to show the strain of frontline command. Bean found him looking "very worn" and noticed him shivering even while seated in front of the mess hall fire.

In February 1918, Watt was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and given command of the AFC's <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">1st Training Wing</a> (Nos. <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">5</a>, <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">6</a>, <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAAF">7</a> and <a href="No.%208%20Squadron%20RAAF">8</a> Squadrons) headquartered at <a href="Tetbury">Tetbury</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, England; the wing's role was to train replacement pilots for the four operational AFC squadrons in Palestine and France. Watt proposed moving the wing to France, but it remained in England. He was mentioned in despatches by Field Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a> on 7 April, and the commendation was <a href="Gazette%23Gazette%20as%20a%20verb">gazetted</a> on 28 May. Shortly after the end of hostilities in November 1918, novelist <a href="William%20John%20Locke">William John Locke</a> visited 1st Training Wing and found that "there was not one [of Watt's men] who ... did not confide to me his pride in serving under a leader so distinguished". A pilot later opined that as well as having "courage, determination, and an immense capacity for work", Watt possessed "the greatest factor in leadership, a genius for endearing himself (without conscious effort) to all who served under him".

Watt was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 1 January 1919, in recognition of his war service. He returned to Australia on 6 May with the rest of 1st Training Wing's personnel, aboard the troopship "Kaisar-i-Hind", on which he was the ranking officer. Leaving the AFC soon afterwards, he was elected president of the New South Wales section of the Australian Aero Club. He also served as senior delegate on a committee of veteran military pilots examining applications for appointment to a proposed independent Australian air service. Watt was esteemed as a man who did not forget old comrades, providing former AFC members with financial aid and helping them re-establish themselves in civilian life. He maintained an interest in commercial flying but refused an offer to take up the position of controller of civil aviation in 1920 owing to his business interests, which included partnership in the family shipping firm of Gilchrist, Watt & Sanderson Ltd, and directorships of mining, rubber, and art corporations. He also turned down invitations to stand for parliament, and to join the fledgling <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>.

Oswald Watt drowned at <a href="Bilgola%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bilgola Beach</a>, near <a href="Newport%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newport</a>, New South Wales, on 21 May 1921. Cuts and bruising on his body indicated that he had slipped on rocks, struck his head, and rolled unconscious into relatively shallow water. Survived by his 15-year-old son, he was accorded a military funeral two days later at <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">St Jude's Church, Randwick</a>. Members of the AFC, <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, and Australian Aero Club formed a guard of honour at the service, one of the largest in the suburb's history, which also included representatives of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> and <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. Among the tributes was a floral wreath from an anonymous group of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31 May, Watt's body was cremated and his ashes interred in the family vault at St Jude's.

In his will, Watt left two bequests to the Australian Aero Club, one of which was used to establish the <a href="Oswald%20Watt%20Gold%20Medal">Oswald Watt Gold Medal</a> for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation. Winners of the award have included <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a>, <a href="Bert%20Hinkler">Bert Hinkler</a>, <a href="Henry%20Millicer">Henry Millicer</a>, <a href="Ivor%20McIntyre">Ivor McIntyre</a>, <a href="Jon%20Johanson">Jon Johanson</a> and <a href="Andy%20Thomas">Andy Thomas</a>. He also bequeathed a sum to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, to award annually a set of binoculars for the best cadet essay on military aviation or aeronautics. The award was founded as the Oswald Watt Prize later in 1921. Most of the residue of Watt's estate went to the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. Considered one of the university's great benefactors, he was commemorated by the Oswald Watt Fund. In May 1923, the Oswald Watt Wing of the Havilah Home for Orphans, <a href="Wahroonga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wahroonga</a>, was opened by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a>. Watt was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps that was first published in 1923 as part of the "Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918". During World War I, Oswald Watt had been the only AFC officer to command a <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> apart from Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, who was later to become known as the "Father of the RAAF". In 2001, military historian Alan Stephens noted that "had fate drawn him to a post-war career in the Air Force instead of to business and an untimely death, 'Toby' Watt might have challenged Richard Williams as the RAAF's dominant figure in its formative years".

Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem

The arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm, the president of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, marked the culmination of a successful <a href="CIA">CIA</a>-backed "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>" led by General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a> in November 1963. On 2 November 1963, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Diệm</a> and his adviser, his younger brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, were arrested after the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) had been successful in a bloody overnight siege on <a href="Gia%20Long%20Palace">Gia Long Palace</a> in <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a>. The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Diệm regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist protests</a> against long-standing religious discrimination after the <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF%20Ph%E1%BA%ADt%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3n%20shootings">government shooting</a> of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a>.

When rebel forces entered the palace, the Ngô brothers were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in <a href="Ch%E1%BB%A3%20L%E1%BB%9Bn%2C%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Cholon</a>. The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace. The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a> by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Air%20Base">Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base</a>. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Nhung">Nguyễn Văn Nhung</a>, and on Major <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Hi%E1%BA%BFu%20Ngh%C4%A9a">Dương Hiếu Nghĩa</a>, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.

Diệm's political career began in July 1954, when he was appointed the Prime Minister of the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a> by former Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>, who was Head of State. At the time, Vietnam had been <a href="Partition%20of%20Vietnam">partitioned</a> at the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Conference</a> after the defeat of the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a>, with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the 17th parallel. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Diệm and Bảo Đại were locked in a power struggle. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Diệm scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Diệm won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.

Diệm refused to hold the reunification elections, on the basis that the State of Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and <a href="Nepotism">nepotistic</a> rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a>, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.

Diệm kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his brothers and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a <a href="1960%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup%20attempt">paratroop revolt</a> was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 <a href="1962%20South%20Vietnamese%20Independence%20Palace%20bombing">palace bombing</a> by two <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">air force</a> pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were "de facto" exempt from performing <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>, the birthday of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>.

In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively invoked; the <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a> was banned from display on <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a> while the <a href="Vatican%20flag">Vatican flag</a> was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop <a href="Pierre%20Martin%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục</a>, Diệm's elder brother. The Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Nhu's <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Special Forces</a> raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country, arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before, but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence after the <a href="Kennedy%20administration">administration</a> of US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> authorised the US embassy to explore the possibility of a leadership change.

At 13:30 on 1 November, Generals <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a> and <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a>, respectively the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Diệm, assisted by mutinous ARVN officers. The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers to prevent them from saving Diệm. Unknown to Diệm, General <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Đính</a>, the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN <a href="III%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">III Corps</a> that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup. The second of Diệm's most trusted loyalist generals was <a href="Hu%E1%BB%B3nh%20V%C4%83n%20Cao">Huỳnh Văn Cao</a>, who commanded the <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">IV Corps</a> in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>. Diệm and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called <a href="Operation%20Bravo">Operation Bravo</a>. This plan involved Đính and Colonel <a href="L%C3%AA%20Quang%20Tung">Tung</a>, the loyalist commander of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Special Forces</a>, staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the "uprising" to reaffirm the power of the Ngô family. Unaware that Đính was plotting against him, Nhu allowed Đính to organise troops as he saw fit, and Đính transferred the command of the Seventh Division from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20H%E1%BB%AFu%20C%C3%B3">Nguyễn Hữu Có</a>, Đính's deputy, to take command of the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">7th Division</a> based at <a href="M%E1%BB%B9%20Tho">Mỹ Tho</a>. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Diệm, as he had done during the previous <a href="1960%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup%20attempt">coup attempt in 1960</a>. Minh and Đôn had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Air%20Base">Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base</a>, headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering. This left only the Presidential Guard to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Diệm would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Diệm refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">7th Division</a> of Colonel <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Thi%E1%BB%87u">Nguyễn Văn Thiệu</a>, who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.

In the early morning of 2 November, Diệm agreed to surrender. The ARVN officers had intended to exile Diệm and Nhu, having promised the Ngô brothers safe passage out of the country. At 06:00, just before dawn, the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss the fate of the Ngô brothers. According to <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a>, the US Army officer and <a href="CIA">CIA</a> operative who was the American liaison with the coup, most of the officers, including Minh, wanted Diệm to have an "honorable retirement" from office, followed by exile. Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting, with having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Diệm and Nhu at JGS headquarters. General <a href="Nguyen%20Ngoc%20Le">Lê</a>, a former police chief under Diệm in the mid-1950s, strongly lobbied for Diệm's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and Lê attracted only minority support. One general was reported to have said "To kill weeds, you must pull them up at the roots". Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.

Minh and Đôn asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, US Ambassador to Vietnam, <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</a>, had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the <a href="Kennedy%20administration">Kennedy administration</a> in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned David Smith, the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute delay. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Diệm. The United States did not want Diệm and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary of State <a href="Roger%20Hilsman">Roger Hilsman</a> had written in August that "under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Diệm, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia." He further went on to anticipate what he termed a "<a href="G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung">Götterdämmerung</a> in the palace".

After surrendering, Diệm called Lodge by telephone for the last time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke for the last time around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered. When Diệm called, Lodge "put [him] on hold" and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, "We just can't get that involved." Dunn said, "I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them." Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, "What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every <a href="Colonel%20Blimp">Colonel Blimp</a> in the world would have made use of them."

Dunn also claimed that Lodge put Diệm on hold in order to inform Conein where the Ngô brothers were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a <a href="US%20Senate">US Senate</a> investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." The historian <a href="Mark%20Moyar">Mark Moyar</a> suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to <a href="Clark%20Air%20Force%20Base">Clark Air Force Base</a> in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up at a time when the outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive."

In the meantime, Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Nhung">Nguyễn Văn Nhung</a>. Minh arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu. Minh had also dispatched a M-113 armored personnel carrier and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport an arrested Diệm and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for official surrender. While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace, Generals Đôn, <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20Thi%E1%BB%87n%20Khi%C3%AAm">Trần Thiện Khiêm</a> and <a href="L%C3%AA%20V%C4%83n%20Kim">Lê Văn Kim</a> prepared the army headquarters for Diệm's arrival and a ceremonial handover of power to the <a href="Military%20junta">junta</a>. Diệm's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up. A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Diệm for the handover to Minh and Vice President <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%C6%A1">Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ</a>, who was to become the civilian Prime Minister. In a nationally televised event witnessed by international media, Diệm would "ask" the generals that he and his brother be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation.

Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the <a href="Presidential%20Guard%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">Presidential Guard</a> to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> Lieutenant <a href="Do%20Tho">Ðỗ Thơ</a>, Diệm's <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20M%E1%BA%ADu">Đỗ Mậu</a>, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and <a href="Xu%C3%A2n%20Vy">Xuân Vy</a>, head of Nhu's <a href="Republican%20Youth">Republican Youth</a>. After the coup, General <a href="Paul%20Harkins">Paul Harkins</a>, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>. <a href="Ellen%20Hammer">Ellen Hammer</a> disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black <a href="Citro%C3%ABn%20DS">Citroën</a> sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">II Corps</a> of General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a>. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." Another story holds that Diệm said "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.

The loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the <a href="Hoa%20people">Chinese</a> business district of <a href="Ch%E1%BB%A3%20L%E1%BB%9Bn%2C%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Cholon</a>. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the <a href="opium">opium</a> trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a>, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%E1%BA%A3o">Phạm Ngọc Thảo</a> was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in <a href="Ch%E1%BB%A3%20L%E1%BB%9Bn%2C%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Cholon</a>. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being "I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a> that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> was celebrated for <a href="All%20Souls%27%20Day">All Souls' Day</a> (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received <a href="Communion%20rite">Communion</a>.

A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building. Lieutenant Thơ, who had earlier urged Diệm to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20M%E1%BA%ADu">Đỗ Mậu</a>, along with Đính and Khiêm, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later "I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death".

The convoy was led by General <a href="Mai%20H%E1%BB%AFu%20Xu%C3%A2n">Mai Hữu Xuân</a> and consisted of Colonels Nguyễn Văn Quan and Dương Ngọc Lắm. Quan was the deputy of Minh and Lắm was the Commander of Diệm's <a href="Civil%20Guard%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">Civil Guard</a>. Lắm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Hi%E1%BA%BFu%20Ngh%C4%A9a">Dương Hiếu Nghĩa</a> and Captain <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Nhung">Nguyễn Văn Nhung</a>. Nhung was Minh's bodyguard.

Diệm requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled. Xuân turned him down, clinically stating that his orders were to take Diệm and Nhu directly to headquarters. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC, asking, "You use such a vehicle to drive the president?" Lắm assured them that the armour was for their own protection. Xuân said that it was selected to protect them from "extremists". Xuân ordered the brothers' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier. One officer asked to shoot Nhu, but Xuân turned him down.

After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa sat with the brothers in the APC, and the <a href="convoy">convoy</a> departed for Tân Sơn Nhất. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a> with a <a href="semi-automatic%20firearm">semi-automatic firearm</a> and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.

Nghĩa gave his account of what occurred during the journey back to the military headquarters: "As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Diệm sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don't know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion." Nghĩa said that when the convoy reached a train crossing, "[Nhung] lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied."

When the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters, the generals were shocked. Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu, they still respected Diệm. One general broke down and wept while Minh's assistant, Colonel Nguyễn Văn Quan collapsed on a table. General <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Đính</a>, the military commander of the III Corps which controlled Saigon, later declared, "I couldn't sleep that night". Đôn maintained that the generals were "truly grievous" over the deaths, maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Diệm a safe exile. Đôn charged Nhu with convincing Diệm to reject the offer. Lodge later concluded, "Once again, brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Diệm's life."

Đôn ordered another general to tell reporters that the Ngô brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office.


At this time, Xuân walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of Đôn's presence. Xuân snapped <a href="At%20attention">to attention</a> and stated, ""Mission accomplished."" Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington, D.C. the CIA sent word to the White House that Diệm and Nhu were dead, allegedly by suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, and that they had committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to Tân Sơn Nhứt. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General <a href="Paul%20Harkins">Paul Harkins</a> reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy, saying "Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide."

Kennedy learned of the deaths on the following morning when National Security Council staffer <a href="Michael%20Forrestal">Michael Forrestal</a> rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers' alleged suicides. According to General <a href="Maxwell%20Taylor">Maxwell Taylor</a>, "Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before." Kennedy had planned that <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> would be safely exiled and <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%2C%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.</a> recalled that the US President was "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was "particularly abhorrent" and blaming himself for approving <a href="Cable%20243">Cable 243</a>, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">attacks on the Buddhist pagodas</a>. Forrestal said that "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country."

Kennedy's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration. Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable, assassination was always a possibility. Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place. He reasoned the devoutly Catholic Ngô brothers would not have taken their own lives, but <a href="Roger%20Hilsman">Roger Hilsman</a> rationalised the possibility of suicide by asserting that Diệm and Nhu would have interpreted the coup as <a href="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>. US officials soon became aware of the true reasons for the deaths of Diệm and Nhu. <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a> had left the rebel headquarters as the generals were preparing to bring in the Ngô brothers for the press conference which announced the handover of power. Upon returning to his residence, Conein received a phone call from Saigon's CIA station that ordered him to report to the embassy. The embassy informed Conein that Kennedy had instructed him to find Diệm. Conein returned to Tân Sơn Nhứt at around 10:30. The following conversation was reported:

Conein knew that if he saw the execution wounds, he would not be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" read "'Suicide' with no hands."

After the deaths, the military junta asserted that the Ngô brothers had committed suicide. On 6 November, Information Minister Trần Tự Oai declared at a news conference that Diệm and Nhu had died through "accidental suicide" after a firearm discharged when Nhu had tried to seize it from the arresting officer. This drew immediate skepticism from <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", who won a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for his Vietnam reporting. Halberstam wrote to the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20State">US Department of State</a> that "extremely reliable private military sources" had confirmed that the brothers were ordered to be executed upon their return to military headquarters. <a href="Neil%20Sheehan">Neil Sheehan</a> of <a href="UPI">UPI</a> reported a similar account based on what he described as "highly reliable sources". Father Leger of Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church asserted that the Ngô brothers were kneeling inside the building when soldiers burst in, took them outside and into the APC. Lodge had been informed by "an unimpeachable source" that both brothers were shot in the nape of the neck and that Diệm's body bore the signs of a beating.

Once the news of the cause of death of the Ngo brothers began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">US Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings. Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left on the floor of the vehicle. Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating Đôn on the "masterful performance" of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. Đôn's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that "I am sure assassination was not at their direction." Minh and Đôn reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the <a href="Kennedy%20administration">Kennedy administration</a> were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs <a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a> declared that "it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed." He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a>, said that "I wanted to sit down and cry", citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.

According to historian Howard Jones, the fact "that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused." The assassinations caused a split within the coup leadership, turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord, and further abroad repulsed American and world opinion, exploding the myth that this new regime would constitute a distinct improvement over their predecessors, and ultimately convinced Washington that even though the leaders' names had changed in Saigon, the situation remained the same. The criticism of the killings further caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government. Đôn expressed his abhorrence at the assassinations by caustically remarking that he had organised the armoured car in an effort to protect Diệm and Nhu. Khanh claimed that the only condition he had put on joining the conspiracy was that Diem would not be killed. According to Jones, "when decisions regarding postcoup affairs took priority, resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form."

The responsibility for the assassinations was generally placed on Minh. Conein asserted that "I have it on very good authority of very many people, that Big Minh gave the order", as did <a href="William%20Colby">William Colby</a>, the director of the CIA's Far Eastern division. Đôn was equally emphatic, saying "I can state without equivocation that this was done by General Dương Văn Minh and by him alone." Lodge thought that Xuân was also partly culpable asserting that "Diệm and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xuân personally, at least at his direction."

Minh placed the blame on Thiệu, after the latter became President, for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thiệu was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. Đôn was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone "Why are you so slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Đính</a> to send more troops – and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general." Thiệu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut: "Dương Văn Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ngô Đình Diệm."

During the presidency of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost to him in the 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under <a href="E.%20Howard%20Hunt">E. Howard Hunt</a> into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.

Conein asserted that Minh's humiliation by Diệm and Nhu was a major motivation for ordering their executions. Conein reasoned that Diệm and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace, instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile. Having successfully stormed the palace, Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside, and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform "with a sedan and everything else." Conein described Minh as a "very proud man" who had lost face at turning up at the palace for his moment of glory, only to find an empty building. More than a decade after the coup, Conein claimed Diệm and Nhu would not have been killed if they had been in the palace, because there were too many people present.

One Vietnamese Diệm loyalist asked friends in the CIA why an assassination had taken place, reasoning that if Diem was deemed to be inefficient, his deposal would suffice. The CIA employees responded that "They had to kill him. Otherwise his supporters would gradually rally and organise and there would be civil war." Some months after the event, Minh was reported to have privately told an American that "We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Diệm could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared – and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power."

<a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20H%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Trần Văn Hương</a>, a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the <a href="Caravelle%20Manifesto">Caravelle Manifesto</a> that criticised Diệm, and later briefly served as Prime Minister, gave a scathing analysis of the generals' action. He stated that "The top generals who decided to murder Diệm and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive."

At around 16:00 on 2 November, the bodies of Diệm and Nhu were identified by the wife of former Cabinet minister Trần Trùng Dung. The corpses were taken to St. Paul's Catholic Hospital, where a French doctor made a formal statement of death without conducting an autopsy. The original death certificate did not describe Diệm as Head of State but as "Chief of Province", a post he had held four decades earlier under the French colonial administration. Nhu was described as "Chief of Library Service", a post which he held in the 1940s. This was interpreted as a Vietnamese way of expressing contempt for the two despised leaders. Their place of burial was never disclosed by the junta and rumours regarding it persist to the current day. The speculated burial places include a military prison, a local cemetery, the grounds of the JGS headquarters at Tan Son Nhut and there are reports of cremation as well. Nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings.

The government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Diệm and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Diệm's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Banners proclaimed Diệm as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Diệm. Madame Thiệu, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Diệm died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country. Thiệu sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Diệm's personal characteristics. Diệm frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thieu, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thiệu's attempts to associate himself with Diệm's relative independence from United States influence was not successful. According to General <a href="Maxwell%20Taylor">Maxwell Taylor</a>, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, ""there was the memory of Diệm to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves"".

Whaam!

Whaam! is a 1963 <a href="diptych">diptych</a> painting by the American artist <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. It is one of the best-known works of <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>, and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. "Whaam!" was first exhibited at the <a href="Leo%20Castelli%20Gallery">Leo Castelli Gallery</a> in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a> since 2006.

The left-hand panel shows a fighter plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, hits a second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several <a href="comic-book">comic-book</a> panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 <a href="War%20comics">war comic book</a>, by presenting it as a diptych while altering the relationship of the graphical and narrative elements. "Whaam!" is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of the painting, and displayed in large <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a> in the right panel.

Lichtenstein studied as an artist before and after serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He practiced anti-aircraft drills during basic training, and he was sent for pilot training but the program was canceled before it started. Among the topics he tackled after the war were romance and <a href="military%20art">war</a>. He depicted aerial combat in several works. "Whaam!" is part of a series on war that he worked on between 1962 and 1964, and along with "<a href="As%20I%20Opened%20Fire">As I Opened Fire</a>" (1964) is one of his two large war-themed paintings.

In 1943 Lichtenstein left his study of painting and drawing at <a href="The%20Ohio%20State%20University">The Ohio State University</a> to serve in the U.S. Army, where he remained until January 1946. After entering training programs for languages, engineering, and piloting, all of which were canceled, he served as an orderly, draftsman and artist in noncombat roles. One of his duties at <a href="Camp%20Shelby">Camp Shelby</a> was enlarging <a href="Bill%20Mauldin">Bill Mauldin</a>'s "<a href="Stars%20and%20Stripes%20%28newspaper%29">Stars and Stripes</a>" cartoons. He was sent to Europe with an engineer battalion, but did not see active combat. As a painter, he eventually settled on an <a href="Abstract%20expressionism">abstract-expressionist</a> style with parodist elements. Around 1958 he began to incorporate hidden images of cartoon characters such as <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> into his abstract works.

A new generation of artists emerged in late 1950s and early 1960s with a more objective, "cool" approach characterized by the <a href="art%20movement">art movement</a>s known today as <a href="Minimalism%20%28visual%20arts%29">minimalism</a>, <a href="hard-edge%20painting">hard-edge painting</a>, <a href="color%20field">color field</a> painting, the <a href="neo-Dada">neo-Dada</a> movement, <a href="Fluxus">Fluxus</a>, and <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>, all of which re-defined the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> contemporary art of the time. Pop art and neo-Dada re-introduced and changed the use of imagery by <a href="Appropriation%20%28art%29">appropriating</a> subject matter from commercial art, consumer goods, art history and mainstream culture. Lichtenstein achieved international recognition during the 1960s as one of the initiators of the pop art movement in America. Regarding his use of imagery <a href="MoMA">MoMA</a> curator Bernice Rose observed that Lichtenstein was interested in "challenging the notion of originality as it prevailed at that time."
Lichtenstein's early comics-based works such as "<a href="Look%20Mickey">Look Mickey</a>" focused on popular animated characters. By 1963 he had progressed to more serious, dramatic subject matter, typically focusing on romantic situations or war scenes. Comic books as a genre were held in low esteem at the time. Public antipathy led in 1954 to examination of alleged connections between comic books and <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">youth crime</a> during <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Subcommittee%20on%20Juvenile%20Delinquency">Senate investigations into juvenile delinquency</a>; by the end of that decade, comic books were regarded as material of "the lowest commercial and intellectual kind", according to Mark Thistlethwaite of the <a href="Modern%20Art%20Museum%20of%20Fort%20Worth">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>. Lichtenstein was not a comic-book enthusiast as a youth, but was enticed as an artist by the challenge of creating art based on a subject remote from the typical "artistic image". Lichtenstein admitted he was "very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images."

Lichtenstein's romance and war comic-based works took heroic subjects from small source panels and monumentalized them. "Whaam!" is comparable in size to the generally large canvases painted at that time by the abstract expressionists. It is one of Lichtenstein's many works with an aeronautical theme. He said that "the heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don't take them seriously in these paintings—maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point. I use them for purely formal reasons."

"Whaam!" adapts a panel by <a href="Irv%20Novick">Irv Novick</a> from the "Star Jockey" story from issue No. 89 of <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>' "<a href="All-American%20Men%20of%20War">All-American Men of War</a>" (Feb. 1962). The original forms part of a dream sequence in which fictional World War II <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> pilot Johnny Flying Cloud, "the <a href="navajo%20people">Navajo</a> ace", foresees himself flying a <a href="First-generation%20jet%20fighter">jet fighter</a> while shooting down other jet planes. In Lichtenstein's painting, both the attacking and target planes are replaced by different types of aircraft. <a href="Paul%20Gravett">Paul Gravett</a> suggests that Lichtenstein substituted the attacking plane with an aircraft from "Wingmate of Doom" illustrated by <a href="Jerry%20Grandenetti">Jerry Grandenetti</a> in the subsequent issue (#90, April 1962), and that the target plane was borrowed from a <a href="Russ%20Heath">Russ Heath</a> drawing in the third panel of page 3 of the "Aces Wild" story in the same issue No. 89. The painting also omits the speech bubble from the source in which the pilot exclaims "The enemy has become a flaming star!"
A smaller, single-panel oil painting by Lichtenstein around the same time, "Tex!", has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an <a href="air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air missile</a> at a second plane that is exploding in the upper right, with a word bubble. The same issue of "All-American Men of War" was the inspiration for at least three other Lichtenstein paintings, "<a href="Okay%20Hot-Shot%2C%20Okay%21">Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!</a>", "<a href="Brattata">Brattata</a>" and "<a href="Blam%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Blam</a>", in addition to "Whaam!" and "Tex!" The graphite pencil sketch, "<a href="Jet%20Pilot%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Jet Pilot</a>" was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by <a href="Robert%20Kanigher">Robert Kanigher</a> and illustrated by Novick, including "Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!", "<a href="Jet%20Pilot%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Jet Pilot</a>" and "Von Karp".

Lichtenstein repeatedly depicted aerial combat between the United States and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. In the early and mid-1960s, he produced "explosion" sculptures, taking subjects such as the "catastrophic release of energy" from paintings such as "Whaam!" and depicting them in freestanding and relief forms. In 1963, he was parodying a variety of artworks, from advertising and comics and to "<a href="high%20culture">high art</a>" modern masterpieces by <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>, <a href="Piet%20Mondrian">Mondrian</a>, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a> and others. At the time, Lichtenstein noted that "the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire."

Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition was held at the <a href="Leo%20Castelli%20Gallery">Leo Castelli Gallery</a> in New York City, from 10 February to 3 March 1962. It sold out before its opening. The exhibition included "<a href="Look%20Mickey">Look Mickey</a>", "<a href="Engagement%20Ring%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Engagement Ring</a>", "<a href="Blam%20%28Roy%20Lichtenstein%29">Blam</a>" and "The Refrigerator". According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, "Whaam!" was part of Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery from 28 September to 24 October 1963, that also included "<a href="Drowning%20Girl">Drowning Girl</a>", "<a href="Baseball%20Manager">Baseball Manager</a>", "<a href="In%20the%20Car">In the Car</a>", "Conversation", and "<a href="Torpedo...Los%21">Torpedo...Los!</a>" Marketing materials for the show included the <a href="Lithography">lithograph</a> artwork, "<a href="Crak%21">Crak!</a>"

The Lichtenstein Foundation website says that Lichtenstein began using his <a href="opaque%20projector">opaque projector</a> technique in 1962. in 1967 he described his process for producing comics-based art as follows:

"Whaam!" was purchased by the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> in 1966. In 1969, Lichtenstein donated his initial graphite-on-paper drawing "Drawing for Whaam!", describing it as a "pencil scribble". According to the Tate, Lichtenstein claimed that this drawing represented his "first visualization of "Whaam!" and that it was executed just before he started the painting." Although he had conceived of a unified work of art on a single canvas, he made the sketch on two sheets of paper of equal size—measuring . The painting has been displayed at <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a> since 2006. In 2012–13, both works were included in the largest Lichtenstein retrospective yet exhibited, visiting the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., the Tate Modern in London and the <a href="Centre%20Georges%20Pompidou">Centre Pompidou</a>.

"Whaam!" depicts a fighter aircraft in the left panel firing a rocket into an enemy plane in the right panel, which disintegrates in a vivid red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is emphasized by the use of the <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> lettering ""WHAAM!"" in the right panel, and a yellow-boxed caption with black lettering at the top of the left panel. The textual exclamation "WHAAM!" can be considered the graphic equivalent of a <a href="sound%20effect">sound effect</a>. This was to become a characteristic of his work—like others of his onomatopoeic paintings that contain exclamations such as "<a href="Bratatat%21">Bratatat!</a>" and "<a href="Varoom%21">Varoom!</a>"

"Whaam!" is one of Lichtenstein's series of war images, typically combining vibrant colors with an expressive narrative. "Whaam!" is very large, measuring 1.7 m × 4.0 m (5 ft 7 in × 13 ft 4 in). It is less abstract than "As I Opened Fire", another of his war scenes. Lichtenstein employs his usual comic-book style: stereotyped imagery in bright primary colors with black outlines, coupled with imitations of mechanical printer's <a href="Ben-Day%20dots">Ben-Day dots</a>. The use of these dots, which were invented by Benjamin Day to simulate color variations and shading, are considered Lichtenstein's "signature method". "Whaam!" departs from Lichtenstein's earlier diptychs such as "Step-on-Can with Leg" and "Like New", in that the panels are not two variations of the same image.

Although Lichtenstein strove to remain faithful to the source images, he constructed his paintings in a traditional manner, starting with a sketch which he adjusted to improve the composition and then projected on to a canvas to make the finished painting. In the case of "Whaam!", the sketch is on two pieces of paper, and the finished work is painted with <a href="Magna%20%28paint%29">Magna</a> <a href="acrylic%20paint">acrylic</a> and <a href="oil%20paint">oil paint</a> on canvas. Although the transformation from a single-panel conception into a diptych painting occurred during the initial sketch, the final work varies from the sketch in several ways. The sketch suggests that the "WHAAM!" motif would be colored white, although it is yellow in the finished work. Lichtenstein enlarged the main graphical subject of each panel (the plane on the left and the flames on the right), bringing them closer together as a result.

Lichtenstein built up the image with multiple layers of paint. The paint was applied using a scrub brush and handmade metal screen to produce Ben-Day dots via a process that left physical evidence behind. The Ben-Day dots technique enabled Lichtenstein to give his works a mechanically reproduced feel. Lichtenstein said that the work is "supposed to look like a fake, and it achieves that, I think".

Lichtenstein split the composition into two panels to separate the action from its consequence. The left panel features the attacking plane—placed at a diagonal to create a sense of depth—below the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane. In the right panel, the exploding plane—depicted head-on—is outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation "WHAAM!". Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events, the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile. Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: "I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other."

Lichtenstein altered the composition to make the image more compelling, by making the exploding plane more prominent compared to the attacking plane than in the original. The smoke trail of the missile becomes a horizontal line. The flames of the explosion dominate the right panel, but the pilot and the airplane in the left panel are the narrative focus. They exemplify Lichtenstein's painstaking detailing of physical features such as the aircraft's cockpit. The other element of the narrative content is a <a href="Speech%20balloon">text balloon</a> that contains the following text: "I pressed the fire control ... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky ..." This is among the text believed to have been written by "All-American Men of War" editor <a href="Robert%20Kanigher">Robert Kanigher</a>. The yellow word "WHAAM!", altered from the red in the original comic-book panel and white in the pencil sketch, links the yellow of the explosion below it with the textbox to the left and the flames of the missile below the attacking plane.

Lichtenstein's borrowings from comics mimicked their style while adapting their subject matter. He explained that "Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter. There are certain things that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art." Rebecca Bengal at <a href="PBS">PBS</a> wrote that "Whaam!"'s graphic clarity exemplifies the <a href="ligne%20claire">ligne claire</a> style associated with <a href="Herg%C3%A9">Hergé</a>, a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged. Lichtenstein was attracted to using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines similar to those used to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint." Lichtenstein once said of his technique: "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental."

The painting was, for the most part, well received by art critics when first exhibited. A November 1963 "Art Magazine" review by <a href="Donald%20Judd">Donald Judd</a> described "Whaam!" as one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. In his review of the exhibition, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" art critic <a href="Brian%20O%27Doherty">Brian O'Doherty</a> described Lichtenstein's technique as "typewriter pointillism ... that laboriously hammers out such moments as a jet shooting down another jet with a big BLAM". According to O'Doherty, the result was "certainly not art, [but] time may make it so", depending on whether it could be "rationalized ... and placed in line for the future to assimilate as history, which it shows every sign of doing." The <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> in London acquired the work in 1966, leading to heated argument amongst their trustees and some vocal members of the public. The purchase was made from art dealer <a href="Ileana%20Sonnabend">Ileana Sonnabend</a>, whose asking price of £4,665 (£ in 2019 currency) was reduced by negotiation to £3,940 (£ in 2019 currency). Some Tate trustees opposed the acquisition, among them sculptor <a href="Barbara%20Hepworth">Barbara Hepworth</a>, painter <a href="Andrew%20Forge">Andrew Forge</a> and the poet and critic <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a>. Defending the acquisition, art historian Richard Morphet, then an assistant <a href="Curator">keeper</a> at the Tate, suggested that the painting addresses several issues and painterly styles at the same time: "history painting, Baroque extravagance, and the quotidian phenomenon of mass-circulation comic strips." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in 1967 described the acquisition as a "very large and spectacular painting". The Tate's director, <a href="Norman%20Reid%20%28museum%20director%29">Norman Reid</a>, later said that the work aroused more public interest than any of its acquisitions since World War II.

In 1968, "Whaam!" was included in the Tate's first solo exhibition of Lichtenstein's work. The showing attracted 52,000 visitors, and was organized with the <a href="Stedelijk%20Museum">Stedelijk Museum</a> in Amsterdam, which later hosted the exhibition from 4 November to 17 December 1967, before it traveled to three other museums.

For José Pierre, "Whaam!" represents Lichtenstein's 1963 expansion "into the 'epic' vein". Keith Roberts, in a 1968 "<a href="Burlington%20Magazine">Burlington Magazine</a>" article, described the explosion as combining ""art nouveau" elegance with a nervous energy reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism". Wendy Steiner believes the work is Lichtenstein's most successful and harmonious comic-based composition. She sees the narrative and graphic elements as complementary: the action and spatial alignment lead the viewer's eye from left to right so as to emphasize the relationship between the action and its explosive consequence. The ellipses of the text balloon present a progression which culminates with a "WHAAM!". The "coincidence of pictorial and verbal order" are clear for the Western viewer with the explanatory text beginning in the upper left and action vector moving from the left foreground to the right background, culminating in a graphical explosion in tandem with a narrative exclamation. Steiner says the striking incongruity of the two panels—the left panel appearing to be "truncated", while the right depicts a centralized explosion—enhances the work's narrative power.

Lichtenstein's technique has been characterized by Ernst A. Busche as "the enlargement and unification of his source material ... on the basis of strict artistic principles". Extracted from a larger narrative, the resulting stylized image became in some cases a "virtual abstraction". By recreating their minimalistic graphic techniques, Lichtenstein reinforced the artificial nature of comic strips and advertisements. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material made his impersonally drawn motifs seem all the more empty. Busche also says that although a critique of modern industrial America may be read into these images, Lichtenstein "would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture".

David McCarthy contrasted Lichtenstein's "dispassionate, detached and oddly disembodied" presentation of aerial combat with the work of <a href="H.C.%20Westermann">H.C. Westermann</a>, for whom the experience of military service in World War II instilled a need to horrify and shock. In contrast, Lichtenstein registers his "comment on American civilization" by scaling up inches-high comic book images to the oversized dimensions of <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>. Laura Brandon saw an attempt to convey "the trivialization of culture endemic in contemporary American life" by depicting a shocking scene of combat as a banal Cold War act.

Carol Strickland and John Boswell say that by magnifying the comic book panels to an enormous size with dots, "Lichtenstein slapped the viewer in the face with their triviality." H. H. Arnason noted that "Whaam!" presents "limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing," which produce "a hard-edge subject painting that documents while it gently parodies the familiar hero images of modern America." The flat and highly finished style of planned brushstrokes can be seen as pop art's reaction against the looseness of abstract expressionism. Alastair Sooke says that the work can be interpreted as a symbolic self-portrait in which the pilot in the left panel represents Lichtenstein "vanquishing his competitors in a dramatic art-world dogfight" by firing a missile at the colorful "parody of abstract painting" in the right panel.

According to Ernesto Priego, while the work adapts a comic-book source, the painting is neither a comic nor a comics panel, and "its meaning is solely referential and <a href="post%20hoc%20theorizing">post hoc</a>." It directs the attention of its audience to features such as genre and printing methods. Visually and narratively, the original panel was the climactic element of a dynamic page composition. Lichtenstein emphasizes the onomatopoeia while playing down articulated speech by removing the speech balloon. According to Priego, "by stripping the comics panel from its narrative context, "Whaam!" is representative in the realm of fine art of the preference of the image-icon over image-narrative".

"Whaam!" is sometimes said to belong to the same anti-war genre as Picasso's "<a href="Guernica%20%28painting%29">Guernica</a>", a suggestion dismissed by Bradford R. Collins. Instead, Collins views the painting as a revenge fantasy against Lichtenstein's first wife Isabel, conceived as it was during their bitter divorce battle (the couple separated in 1961 and divorced in 1965).

Marla F. Prather observed that "Whaam!"'s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its position as a historic work of pop art. With "<a href="As%20I%20Opened%20Fire">As I Opened Fire</a>", Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, "Whaam!" is regarded as the culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with "Drowning Girl", as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> prints, as one of the most famous works of pop art. <a href="Gianni%20Versace">Gianni Versace</a> once linked the two iconic pop art images via his <a href="gown">gown</a> designs. According to <a href="Douglas%20Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a>, the "<a href="World%20Book%20Encyclopedia">World Book Encyclopedia</a>" used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and "Whaam!" to illustrate its Pop art entry.
Comic books were in turn affected by the cultural impact of pop art. By the mid-1960s, some comic books were displaying a new emphasis on garish colors, emphatic sound effects and stilted dialogue—the elements of comic book style that had come to be regarded as <a href="camp%20%28style%29">camp</a>—in an attempt to appeal to older, college-age readers who appreciated pop art. Gravett observed that the "simplicity and outdatedness [of comic books] were ripe for being mocked".

"Whaam!" was one of the key works exhibited in a major Lichtenstein retrospective in 2012–2013 that was designed, according to Li-mei Hoang, to demonstrate "the importance of Lichtenstein's influence, his engagement with art history and his enduring legacy as an artist". In his review of the Lichtenstein Retrospective at the <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a>, <a href="Adrian%20Searle">Adrian Searle</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"—who was generally unenthusiastic about Lichtenstein's work—credited the work's title with accurately describing its graphic content: "Whaam! goes the painting, as the rocket hits, and the enemy fighter explodes in a livid, comic-book roar." "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" critic Alastair Smart wrote a disparaging review in which he acknowledged Lichtenstein's reputation as a leading figure in "Pop Art's cheeky assault on the swaggering, self-important Abstract Expressionists", whose works Smart said "Whaam!" mimicked by its huge scale. Smart said the work was neither a positive commentary on the fighting American spirit nor a critique, but was notable for marking "Lichtenstein's incendiary impact on the US art scene".

Detractors have raised concerns over Lichtenstein's <a href="Appropriation%20%28art%29">appropriation</a>, in that he directly references imagery from other sources in "Whaam!" and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a>, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals in the case of "Whaam!", as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.

In <a href="Alastair%20Sooke">Alastair Sooke</a>'s 2013 <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> documentary that took place in front of "Whaam!" at the Tate Modern, British comic book artist <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> disputed Sooke's assertion that Lichtenstein's painting improved upon Novick's panel, saying: "This to me looks flat and abstracted, to the point of view that to my eyes it's confusing. Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks." Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.

SS Christopher Columbus

The SS "Christopher Columbus" was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="passenger%20ship">excursion liner</a> on the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, in service between 1893 and 1933. She was the only <a href="whaleback">whaleback</a> ship ever built for passenger service. The ship was designed by <a href="Alexander%20McDougall%20%281845-1923%29">Alexander McDougall</a>, the developer and promoter of the whaleback design.

"Columbus" was built between 1892 and 1893 at <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a>, by the <a href="American%20Steel%20Barge%20Company">American Steel Barge Company</a>. Initially, she <a href="ferry">ferried</a> passengers to and from the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a>. Later, she provided general transportation and excursion services to various ports around the lakes.

At , the ship was the longest whaleback ever built, and reportedly also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched. "Columbus" is said to have carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at <a href="Manitowoc%2C%20Wisconsin">Manitowoc, Wisconsin</a>.

The history of the "Columbus" is linked with that of the whalebacks, an innovative but not widely accepted ship design of the late 1880s, and of their designer, <a href="Alexander%20McDougall%20%281845-1923%29">Alexander McDougall</a>. A <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigrant</a>, Great Lakes <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>, inventor and entrepreneur, McDougall developed the idea of the whaleback as a way to improve the ability of <a href="barge">barge</a>s to follow a towing vessel in heavy seas. Whalebacks were characterized by distinctive <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> shapes with rounded tops, lacking conventional vertical sides. Waves thus broke across their hulls with considerably less force than when striking a conventional hull. Water could also flow around the rounded turrets which resembled <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s on contemporary warships; the superstructure and deckhouses were mounted on these turrets. The rounded contours of whalebacks gave them an unconventional appearance,

and McDougall's ship and barge designs were received with considerable skepticism, resistance, and derision. As they had porcine-looking snouts for bows, some observers called them "pig boats".

After McDougall was unable to persuade existing shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a> in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the <a href="SS%20Charles%20W.%20Wetmore">SS "Charles W. Wetmore"</a> to London, and starting another shipyard in <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a>, which built the <a href="SS%20City%20of%20Everett">SS "City of Everett"</a>. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, to be held in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize his design. The "Columbus", conceived as an elaborate <a href="ferry">ferry</a>, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his <a href="Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus%23First%20voyage">first voyage</a> to the New World.

The World's Fair Steamship Company ordered the construction of the "Columbus" at an estimated cost of <a href="US%24">$</a>360,000. The job was undertaken at McDougall's American Steel Barge Company works in Superior, Wisconsin, starting in the fall of 1892.

The hull framing, which included nine <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>, was completed on September 13, 1892. The ship's propulsion mechanisms were next installed, consisting of a single four-bladed, diameter, pitch <a href="propeller">propeller</a>, the two <a href="steam%20engine%23Multiple%20expansion%20engines">reciprocating triple-expansion steam engines</a> (with three cylinders of , and diameters in a common frame with a stroke) manufactured by <a href="Samuel%20F.%20Hodge%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Samuel F. Hodge & Co.</a> of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, and six steel tubular return <a href="Scotch%20boiler">Scotch boiler</a>s, ( diameter by long), built by <a href="Cleveland%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Cleveland Shipbuilding Company</a>. The rounded hull top was then added, followed by the six turrets, which were substantially larger than those employed on freighter whalebacks. The ship was launched on December 3, 1892, after which two <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> decks were mounted on the turrets along the centerline of her hull to afford access to her two internal decks, one in the turrets and one in the hull below.

She was fitted out over the remainder of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted <a href="promenade%20deck">promenade deck</a> contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.
McDougall's American Steel Barge Company had committed in the contract that the "Columbus" would be built and delivered in three months, making her one of the fastest-built large ships of her time. The builders further promised rapid loading and unloading, predicting that the vessel would be able to embark 5,000 passengers in five minutes, and disembark the same passengers in even less time. The "Columbus" was specified to be able run the from the dock downtown to the fairgrounds at <a href="Jackson%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Jackson Park</a> and 64th Street in 20 minutes.

McDougall set up another holding company, the Columbian Whaleback Steamship Company of <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>, to own and operate the "Columbus". She was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on May 13, 1893. Her first captain was John McArthur, who had captained other whalebacks for McDougall's firms, starting with the first powered whaleback, the "Colgate Hoyt", built in 1890. McDougall was quoted as having said to McArthur, "There is your steamboat; take her down to Chicago and make a success of her."
McArthur did just that. Painted in all white <a href="livery">livery</a>, the "Columbus" made multiple round trips per day, sailing along the <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> shoreline from the <a href="Randolph%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">Randolph Street</a>/Van Buren Street dock to the Jackson Park site of the World's Columbian Exposition's <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux arts</a> "White City" exposition fairgrounds. A contemporary souvenir booklet called her "the greatest marine wonder of its time", and another publication dubbed her the "Queen of the Lakes." She had an estimated capacity of 4,000–5,000 passengers on her four decks, but it was reported that she carried 7,000 on her <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a>. The <a href="Goodrich%20Transit%20Line">Goodrich Transit Line</a> steamer "<a href="USS%20Blue%20Ridge%20%281918%29">Virginia</a>" (later the USS "Blue Ridge") is said to have raced against her.

The "Columbus" carried between 1.7 and 2.0 million passengers (sources differ) during the exposition, with only one fatality, a crew member. In recognition of that success, the commissioners of the exposition presented Captain McArthur with a gold watch engraved with a representation of the ship. McArthur went on to captain other whalebacks including the , which became the , the only whaleback surviving today.

After the exposition ended the "Columbus" entered passenger service, and an additional deck (third superstructure, fifth total) was added during the 1899–1900 winter season. Despite the "Columbus"' success at the exposition, and McDougall's promotional efforts, the whaleback design never caught on. By 1900, the last whalebacks had been built in Superior: the "Alexander McDougall" in 1899 (the last powered ship), and the "John Smeaton", the last whaleback barge. The American Steel Barge Company was sold to the <a href="American%20Ship%20Building%20Company">American Ship Building Company</a>, becoming their Superior Works, and switched to more conventional <a href="lake%20freighter">laker</a> designs.

In 1899 the "Columbus" was leased to and operated by the Goodrich Transit Line,
whose steamer "Virginia" had been a perennial racing rival. She changed hands in 1905 to the Milwaukee & Chicago Transportation company – possibly a Goodrich holding company – and again in 1909 to Goodrich Transit Line. Her livery was at some point between 1906 and 1909 changed to a black hull with yellow accents, and she was placed in service on the route between Chicago and <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>. The "Columbus" remained with the Goodrich line for several years. Although she was used for excursions elsewhere around the Great Lakes, her regular schedule was a daily trip to Milwaukee, leaving Chicago mid-morning, sailing to Milwaukee for a two-hour stopover, and then returning ("see advertisement right"). She made daily <a href="wiktionary%3Around%20trip">round-trip</a> excursions from the Goodrich docks at the <a href="Rush%20Street%20Bridge">Rush Street Bridge</a>.
"Columbus" had at least three accidents. In June 1895 she suffered an explosion caused by a steam pipe becoming disconnected while she was underway. Accounts differ, but some claim that this happened during a race with her rival, "Virginia". In July 1905, she collided with the <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Ralph Campbell" in the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a>. On June 30, 1917, she was involved in her most serious accident, a collision with a <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a>. The collision happened in Milwaukee while she was being maneuvered by <a href="tugboat">tug</a>s away from her dock. The <a href="Milwaukee%20River">Milwaukee River</a> current caught her, spinning her sideways, and her bow sheared off two legs of the Yahr-Lang Drug Company's water tower, toppling it and flooding "Columbus"' decks with about . The collision killed 16 passengers and severely damaged her pilot house, putting her out of service for the rest of the year.
The "Columbus" was one of the first ships to be fitted with an on-board <a href="History%20of%20radio">radio</a>, installed by 1909, when she was allocated the call letters "KC". "Columbus" and the SS "Chicago" used radio to help coordinate the rescue of over 200 passengers from the Goodrich liner "City of Racine" when the "Racine" was disabled off <a href="Waukegan%2C%20Illinois">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, in Lake Michigan.

In 1915, the <a href="SS%20Eastland">SS "Eastland"</a> capsized while docked in the Chicago River, with the loss of over 800 lives. Officials subsequently ordered many passenger ships to undergo stability testing, which the "Columbus" passed easily. Even with 7,500 sandbags (simulating passengers) piled on one side, and tugboats pulling in that direction, she listed only 12 degrees. "Columbus" was featured at the <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">Century of Progress</a> exhibition in Chicago in 1932–33.

The "Columbus" was taken out of service in 1933, and changed hands twice during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, in 1933 and again in 1934. She was scrapped in 1936 at the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in <a href="Manitowoc%2C%20Wisconsin">Manitowoc, Wisconsin</a>.
SS "Christopher Columbus" carried 1.7–2 million passengers in her first year alone, and is estimated to have carried more passengers than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. She was one of the most photographed passenger ships on the lakes, and <a href="souvenir">souvenir</a> <a href="postcard">postcard</a>s of her are still widely available. One of her anchors, the design of which was patented by McDougall on February 3, 1891, is displayed at the <a href="Mariners%27%20Museum">Mariners' Museum</a> in <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>.

U.S. Route 23 in Michigan

US Highway 23 (US 23) is a north–south <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway">United States Numbered Highway</a> that runs from <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, to <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City, Michigan</a>. In the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, it is a major, , north–south <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that runs through the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a>. The trunkline is a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> from the Michigan–<a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> state line near <a href="Lambertville%2C%20Michigan">Lambertville</a> to the city of <a href="Standish%2C%20Michigan">Standish</a>, and it follows the <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> shoreline from there to its northern terminus. Serving the cities of <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> and <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a>, US 23 acts as a freeway bypass of the <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a> area. Overall, the highway runs through rural areas of the state dominated by farm fields or woodlands; some segments are urban in character in the Ann Arbor, Flint and <a href="Tri-Cities%20%28Michigan%29%23The%20Greater%20Tri-Cities%20Region">Tri-Cities</a> areas. The section from Flint north to Standish also carries <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 75</a> (I-75) along a <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a> that includes a segment that carries almost 70,000 vehicles on a daily basis.

The first transportation routes along what is now US 23 in the state were sections of two <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. The route of what is now US 23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a> names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US 23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that ran further inland through the <a href="Northern%20Michigan">northern portion</a> of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the Lower Peninsula were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed by the end of the 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a> at <a href="Zilwaukee%2C%20Michigan">Zilwaukee</a> was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US 23 freeway over a shipping channel.

Various memorial or tourist route designations have been applied to US 23 in the state since the 1980s. The highway has been a part of the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> since the creation of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s in 1986. The non-freeway section was designated the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) in 2004 as a part of what is now the <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> Program. Since 2009, it has been called the Huron Shores Heritage Route. The highway has also carried two memorial designations related to war veterans and a third related to local civic leaders since a 2001 consolidation of related legislation in the state. MDOT has listed two of the highway's bridges on its historic bridge list, one of which is also on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP). Future improvements to the route of US 23 include a proposed northerly extension of the freeway from Standish to one of several locations along the Lake Huron shoreline. Another freeway has been proposed in the Flint area that could connect US 23 directly to the south end of <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a>.

US 23 runs for through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, serving as a freeway bypass to the west of <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a> and a scenic highway through the <a href="Northern%20Michigan">northern portion</a> of the state along Lake Huron. Between <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a> and <a href="Standish%2C%20Michigan">Standish</a>, US 23 <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a>; the combined freeway section from Flint to <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a> can contain between six and eight lanes total while the rest of the US 23 freeway is mostly four lanes. Non-freeway segments of US 23 in the state are two lanes. Like other state trunkline highways, it is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT). All of US 23 in the state south of the <a href="M-32%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-32</a> junction in <a href="Alpena%2C%20Michigan">Alpena</a> has been listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. From the Standish area north, the highway is also a part of the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> and the Huron Shores Heritage Route, a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>.

US 23 enters Michigan on a freeway northwest of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a>, concurrent with <a href="U.S.%20Route%20223">US 223</a>. This freeway runs north through farm fields in rural western <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan">Monroe County</a> near <a href="Lambertville%2C%20Michigan">Lambertville</a>. About north of the state line, US 223 leaves the freeway and turns west onto St. Anthony Road; US 23 continues northward on the freeway. South of <a href="Dundee%2C%20Michigan">Dundee</a>, US 23 crosses the <a href="River%20Raisin">River Raisin</a> before coming to an interchange with <a href="M-50%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-50</a> next to the <a href="Cabela%27s">Cabela's</a> store west of town. North of town, the freeway passes near an industrial area. Farther north, it crosses a line of the <a href="Ann%20Arbor%20Railroad%20%281988%29">Ann Arbor Railroad</a> near <a href="Azalia%2C%20Michigan">Azalia</a> as the trunkline runs to the east of <a href="Milan%2C%20Michigan">Milan</a> at the Monroe-<a href="Washtenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Washtenaw</a> county line. North of Milan, the freeway crosses a line of the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a>.

The landscape takes on a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> (Michigan Avenue) and <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> on the southeast side of the city. Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US 23 carries the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a> (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and the campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. At the same interchange, a <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20Business%20%28Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 23</a> (Bus. US 23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US 23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US 23 crosses the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a> near the campus of <a href="Washtenaw%20Community%20College">the local community college</a> and continues north to a junction with the <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> freeway. The two merge and run westward along the north side of the city before US 23 turns north and M-14 curves south.

North of Ann Arbor, the freeway runs through woodlands and near several lakes. In the community of <a href="Whitmore%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Whitmore Lake</a>, US 23 crosses into <a href="Livingston%20County%2C%20Michigan">Livingston County</a> near the city's namesake body of water. East of <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton</a>, the freeway intersects <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> and continues north to an intersection with <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a> south of <a href="Hartland%2C%20Michigan">Hartland</a>. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of <a href="Fenton%2C%20Michigan">Fenton</a>. The trunkline passes through town and bends back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US 23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches the south side of the Flint area.

West of <a href="Grand%20Blanc%2C%20Michigan">Grand Blanc</a>, US 23 meets I-75, and the two freeways merge near the <a href="Bishop%20International%20Airport">Bishop International Airport</a> and continue along the west side of the Flint metro area. I-75/US 23 has an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> near the crossing with the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> line. Continuing northwards through suburban residential areas, the highway crosses the <a href="Flint%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Flint River</a> while running along the west side of the city. In <a href="Mount%20Morris%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Mount Morris Township</a>, the freeway intersects the northern end of <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a> before meeting <a href="M-57%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-57</a> near <a href="Clio%2C%20Michigan">Clio</a>. The highest traffic totals along US 23 in the state of Michigan were recorded by MDOT near the M-57 interchange; in 2009 an average 68,800 vehicles used that section of freeway daily. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway.

Near <a href="Birch%20Run%2C%20Michigan">Birch Run</a>, the highway turns northwesterly next to a <a href="Birch%20Run%20Premium%20Outlets">large outlet mall</a>. Between here and the Saginaw area, the freeway runs through more wooded lands, crossing the <a href="Cass%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Cass River</a> near <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Michigan">Bridgeport</a>. I-75/US 23 enters the <a href="Tri-Cities%20%28Michigan%29%23The%20Greater%20Tri-Cities%20Region">Tri-Cities</a> (named for <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>, Bay City and <a href="Midland%2C%20Michigan">Midland</a>) when it bypasses Saginaw to the east. The freeway intersects <a href="M-46%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-46</a> in <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Buena Vista Township</a> south of the junction with <a href="Interstate%20675%20%28Michigan%29">I-675</a>. North of downtown Saginaw, the freeway crosses the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a> on the <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a>, a "<a href="Post-tensioned%20concrete">post-tensioned</a>, segmental, [concrete] <a href="box%20girder%20bridge">box girder bridge</a>" that is "infamous" for a series of "construction mishaps, cost overruns, and government foibles."
Past the bridge, I-75/US 23 meets the northern end of I-675 and continues through fields and woods to the Bay City area. At exit 162, the freeway meets the eastern terminus of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> and the western terminus of <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> west of downtown. The next interchange north is with the <a href="M-13%20Connector%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector M-13</a> (CONN M-13) freeway, which was the previous northern end of US 23's freeway in Michigan. The connector runs due northward, and I-75/US 23 turns northwesterly to bypass around <a href="Kawkawlin%2C%20Michigan">Kawkawlin</a>. The highway veers north, crosses the <a href="Kawkawlin%20River">Kawkawlin River</a> and the Pinconning Creek before coming to an interchange southwest of Standish. There, US 23 curves east, separating from I-75. US 23 continues for about as a freeway which ends at the intersection with <a href="M-13%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-13</a> south of Standish. The lowest AADT along any freeway section of US 23 in Michigan is the section immediately east of I-75; here the traffic levels drop from 20,763 to 4,466 vehicles per day after US 23 separates from I-75.

US 23 runs north from the end of its freeway along Huron Road through the community of Standish. The trunkline turns northeasterly through lakeshore woodlands after the intersection with <a href="M-76%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Old M-76</a>. Northeast of this intersection, the highest, non-freeway AADT level on US 23 was recorded by MDOT at 16,757 vehicles daily. Running through <a href="Omer%2C%20Michigan">Omer</a>, the highway crosses the <a href="Rifle%20River">Rifle River</a> and a line of the <a href="Lake%20State%20Railway">Lake State Railway</a>. In between the two crossings, it curves due east on its way out of town. At Hale Road, US 23 meets the southern end of <a href="M-65%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-65</a> before it continues east to <a href="Au%20Gres%2C%20Michigan">Au Gres</a>, where it runs along the <a href="Saginaw%20Bay">Saginaw Bay</a> and crosses the <a href="Au%20Gres%20River">Au Gres River</a>. Huron Road meanders northward along the lakeshore, staying inland near Point Lookout. US 23 runs through woods as it follows the Saginaw Bays shoreline northeasterly through <a href="Alabaster%2C%20Michigan">Alabaster</a> to <a href="Tawas%20City%2C%20Michigan">Tawas City</a>. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of <a href="M-55%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-55</a>, runs north and east around <a href="Tawas%20Bay">Tawas Bay</a> to <a href="East%20Tawas%2C%20Michigan">East Tawas</a> and follows the Lake Huron shoreline to <a href="Oscoda%2C%20Michigan">Oscoda</a>. Through this area, US 23 runs parallel to the Lake State Railway and crosses into the <a href="Huron%20National%20Forest">Huron National Forest</a>.
Oscoda is the location of the eastern termini of both the <a href="River%20Road%20National%20Scenic%20Byway">River Road National Scenic Byway</a> and County Road <a href="F-41%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">F-41</a>. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses the <a href="Au%20Sable%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Au Sable River</a> near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former <a href="Wurtsmith%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wurtsmith Air Force Base</a>. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into <a href="Alcona%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alcona County</a>. The highway meets the eastern termini of <a href="F-30%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">F-30</a> and <a href="M-72%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-72</a> in <a href="Greenbush%2C%20Michigan">Greenbush</a> and <a href="Harrisville%2C%20Michigan">Harrisville</a> respectively. It also passes <a href="Harrisville%20State%20Park">Harrisville State Park</a> in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the <a href="Mackinaw%20State%20Forest">Mackinaw State Forest</a>. Near <a href="Ossineke%2C%20Michigan">Ossineke</a>, the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running along the shoreline of <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20%28Michigan%29">Thunder Bay</a>.

When US 23 enters Alpena, it follows State Street through town and turns northwesterly on Chisholm Street. The intersection of Chisholm and Washington streets marks the eastern terminus of M-32. Chisholm Street runs along the <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20River">Thunder Bay River</a> and crosses the river near Lake Besser. The highway leaves town and runs through rural woodlands to the south shore of Long Lake, curving around the eastern side of the lake. Near the northern end of the lake, US 23 crosses into <a href="Presque%20Isle%20County%2C%20Michigan">Presque Isle County</a> and runs along the west shore of Grand Lake. At the north end of that lake, the highway turns west along the Lake Huron shoreline near <a href="Thompson%27s%20Harbor%20State%20Park">Thompson's Harbor State Park</a>. The trunkline continues to <a href="Rogers%20City%2C%20Michigan">Rogers City</a> where it bypasses town to the south and west, intersecting <a href="F-21%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">F-21</a> and <a href="M-68%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-68</a> in the process; <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20Business%20%28Rogers%20City%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 23</a> runs through downtown. On the other side of Rogers City, US 23 runs along the lake past <a href="Hoeft%20State%20Park">Hoeft State Park</a> and along Hammond Bay before crossing into <a href="Cheboygan%20County%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan County</a>. This area had the lowest AADT levels in 2009 at 1,097 vehicles per day.
US 23 follows the Lake Huron shoreline through Cheboygan County through woodlands past <a href="Cheboygan%20State%20Park">Cheboygan State Park</a> and Duncan Bay. On the eastern edge of <a href="Cheboygan%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan</a> the highway intersects <a href="F-05%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">F-05</a> before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the <a href="Cheboygan%20River">Cheboygan River</a> on the <a href="Cheboygan%20Bascule%20Bridge">Cheboygan Bascule Bridge</a> near the mouth of the river and the dock for the <a href="USCGC%20Mackinaw%20%28WLBB-30%29">USCGC "Mackinaw"</a>. On the west side of the river, US 23 meets the northern terminus of <a href="M-27%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-27</a> at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as <a href="C-66%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">C-66</a> as US 23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on Mackinaw Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a>. As it approaches the village, it passes <a href="Historic%20Mill%20Creek%20State%20Park">Historic Mill Creek State Park</a> and several motels. At Nicolet Street in town, the highway crosses into <a href="Emmet%20County%2C%20Michigan">Emmet County</a> for the short distance to the highway's national northern terminus at I-75's exit 338.

Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. The original Shore Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 23 from the <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a> area to Cheboygan. Another section of the current highway followed the <a href="Saginaw%20Trail">Saginaw Trail</a> between Flint and Saginaw.

Later, during the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a> era, the modern US 23 also coincided with the east branch of the <a href="Dixie%20Highway">Dixie Highway</a> and part of the Lower Peninsula section of the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20International%20Highway">Theodore Roosevelt International Highway</a>. The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he developed the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. At the urging of Governor <a href="Woodbridge%20Ferris">Woodbridge Ferris</a>, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US 23 north of Standish. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was named for former US president <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, to <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. In Michigan, it also followed US 23 north of Standish.

The highway was also part of the East Michigan Pike, designed to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike on the other side of the Lower Peninsula. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of <a href="The%20Thumb">The Thumb</a> between Bay City and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails. The southern part of what is now US 23 in the state was also part of the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.

The first state highways along the US 23 corridor were numbered <a href="M-65%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-65</a> from the Ohio line north to the Flint area and <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> from Flint north to Mackinaw City by July 1, 1919. When originally designated, M-65 was in two sections: the southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. The gap between the two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926.

US 23 was commissioned on November 11, 1926, with the debut of the United States Numbered Highway System. The MSHD removed the M-10 and M-65 designations from the highway at the time. As it was originally designated, US 23 crossed into Michigan from Ohio south of <a href="Temperance%2C%20Michigan">Temperance</a> and ran north to <a href="Ypsilanti%2C%20Michigan">Ypsilanti</a> via <a href="Ida%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Ida</a> and <a href="Maybee%2C%20Michigan">Maybee</a>. Once the highway entered Ann Arbor, it followed the roads that preceded the modern freeway up to Flint. From Flint to Saginaw, US 23 ran concurrently with US 10. On the way north to Bay City, the highway ran on the west side of the Saginaw River before turning north to the Standish area. From Standish to Mackinaw City, US 23 initially took a more inland route through the northeastern Lower Peninsula.
Starting in 1929, MSHD started updating the route that US 23 followed through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing was moved to the east side of the Saginaw River, and <a href="M-47%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-47</a> was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near <a href="Ida%2C%20Michigan">Ida</a>, US 23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and <a href="Whittaker%2C%20Michigan">Whittaker</a>. US 23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via <a href="Whittemore%2C%20Michigan">Whittemore</a> to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through <a href="Twining%2C%20Michigan">Twining</a> and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes.

In 1932, US 23 was moved closer to the lakeshore between <a href="Spruce%2C%20Michigan">Spruce</a> and Alpena; the former routing was redesignated <a href="M-171%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-171</a>. The highway was also moved to a route closer to the lakeshore between Tawas City and Oscoda, with part of the old inland route taking the designation Old US 23. A few years later in 1936, US 23 replaced M-72 between Oscoda and Harrisville and followed a new roadway north to the Spruce area. The M-171 designation was removed from its original routing and applied to the 1932 routing of US 23 by way of <a href="Mikado%2C%20Michigan">Mikado</a> and <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Michigan">Lincoln</a>. In the middle of 1937, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> was extended concurrently along US 23 between Cheboygan and Mackinaw City. Around the end of the decade, US 23's routing was moved in another location to follow the lakeshore; this time the highway was rerouted between Alpena and Rogers City. M-65 was extended northwards from Lachine through Posen to terminate over the former US 23 routing.

US 23 was moved to its current lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, and <a href="M-33%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-33</a> was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US 23 roadway while M-68 was extended eastward through Onaway to Rogers City. In early 1941, <a href="Lafayette%20Avenue%20Bridge">a bridge</a> across the Saginaw River connecting Salzburg and Lafayette avenues in Bay City was added to the route of US 23 in the city; at the same time the former routing was redesignated <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20Business%20%28Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 23</a>. The highway was also realigned between Hartland and Fenton in 1941. By 1945, the northernmost segment of M-65 in downtown Rogers City was redesignated <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20Business%20%28Rogers%20City%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 23</a>, and M-65 was truncated to its junction with US 23 southeast of town, removing the concurrency that existed since 1940. North of Dundee, a more direct alignment to <a href="Azalia%2C%20Michigan">Azalia</a> was added to US 23, turning the former routing back to local control in late 1947 or early 1948; at the same time, the last gravel section of the highway was paved near Hammond Bay in northwestern Presque Isle County.

One of the first pieces of what would later become part of US 23's <a href="freeway">freeway</a> route was completed in late 1951 or early 1952, when a two-lane bypass was built around the eastern side of <a href="Milan%2C%20Michigan">Milan</a>. Two years later, a similar bypass was built from Bridgeport to M-81 on the east side of Saginaw, with the old route becoming a Bus. US 23 designation. Both bypasses would later be upgraded to four-lane freeways by 1961, with the Saginaw one later incorporated into the route of I-75. When the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> opened on November 1, 1957, US 23, US 27 and US 31 were extended along the access roadways to the foot of the bridge.

The first future freeway portion of US 23 was built in 1957 from north of Ann Arbor to Whitmore Lake as a divided highway. On June 30, 1958, the first stretch of the "Fenton–Clio Expressway" opened, stretching from Fenton to Birch Run. The freeway connection from Dundee south to Ohio was opened on October 1, 1959. In late 1959, the portion from Flint to Birch Run also gained the I-75 designation.

In late 1960 or early 1961, a new I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway was built from the north end of the Saginaw bypass to Kawkawlin, utilizing the Zilwaukee drawbridge (later replaced by the <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a>) over the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a>; when it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US 23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City to the end of the freeway at Kawkawlin. Another section connected the Whitmore Lake area with Brighton in the same timeframe. <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> was bidding in 1961 to construct an <a href="Intelligent%20transportation%20system">electronic highway</a>. US 23 between Ann Arbor and Toledo was under consideration to be the location of this project; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> instead. By the end of the year, freeway sections opened to bypass Saginaw south and ran south to Birch Run, another connected south from Fenton to Hartland, and a third connected Milan with Dundee. The remaining gaps were eliminated with additional freeway openings in 1962: Brighton to Hartland opened in September, and Milan to Ann Arbor opened in November. The I-75/US 23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 was shown on maps following US 23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change.

The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the <a href="Federal-Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201968">Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968</a> including a freeway along US 23 between Standish and Mackinaw City. This extension was rejected by Congress on December 13, 1968; instead, Michigan was allotted additional mileage for an extension of I-69 to Flint. Once the last piece of I-75 was completed along the <a href="M-76%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-76</a> corridor in November 1973, the I-75 designation was extended north of Bay City on US 23.

The MSHD first proposed a realignment of US 223 in 1965; this change would reroute that highway to replace M-151 in southern Monroe County, and use the US 23 freeway to connect to Sylvania, Ohio. The rerouting change was made in 1977 when Michigan shifted its segment of US 223 as proposed twelve years prior. Instead of running south through <a href="Ottawa%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa Lake</a>, US 223 continued east to the US 23 freeway and south into Ohio.

The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> to allow shipping traffic to use the river. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on I-75/US 10/US 23 for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends. Approved in 1974, construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979. A major construction accident in August 1982 delayed completion of the new Zilwaukee Bridge; a bridge pier partially collapsed when contractors overloaded a section under construction. The affected deck segment tilted to rest higher on one end and lower on the other. The structure was originally supposed to cost $76.8 million with a 1983 completion date; in the end it cost $131.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) when the southbound span finally opened on September 19, 1988. The structure is the largest segmental concrete bridge in the country.

While that construction was being done, MDOT truncated US 10 at Bay City in 1986; this removed the concurrency between US 10 and US 23 that existed since 1926. A few years later in 1992, the freeway concept for the northeastern LP was revived again when MDOT initiated plans to study and build a new US 23 freeway from Standish northerly to Tawas City, Oscoda or Alpena. This proposal was brought up due to a high level of <a href="tourist">tourist</a> traffic along the current routing since the mid-1960s. The FHWA mandated additional environmental studies for the project in 2000, and MDOT withdrew the proposals two years later.

In November 2016, construction work began on the freeway between Ann Arbor and <a href="Whitmore%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Whitmore Lake</a>. This construction includes replacement of bridges and reconstruction of off ramps. A year later, the flex route system opened, using intelligent traffic management and electronic signs to monitor and redirect traffic. The system can open a temporary travel lane on the inner shoulder during rush hour.

Officials in the Flint area have proposed extending a freeway to directly connect I-475 to US 23. Such an extension, if built, would "include a new freeway coming out of I-475, which would snake across Fenton and Cook roads before connecting into US 23 at Baldwin Road". Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but they were indefinitely postponed in 2011.

Most of US 23, along with <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>, has been designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway. The designation was conferred in Public Act 207 of 1945, with companion legislation for US 2 in 1949. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Romney">George W. Romney</a> had them installed.

North of Standish, US 23 is a part of the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> (LHCT). This tour was created in May 1986 as part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Minnesota</a> and <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20%28Ontario%29">Ontario</a>.

When the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Legislature">Michigan State Legislature</a> consolidated the statutes defining the various memorial highways in 2001, they included the Veterans of World War I Memorial Highway in the law. Defined along I-75/US 23 between Saginaw and Bay City, the designation was included in Public Act 142. That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities. The Roberts-Linton Highway was named in 1931 for local leaders who championed the construction of a highway along the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a>. This name was applied to the original highway routing between Saginaw and Bay City (now a part of M-13). After the 2001 change, the name was moved to the US 23 freeway.

In May 2004, the highway north of Standish was named the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway, a scenic highway designation through what is now called the <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> Program. Since 2009, they local committee that manages the byway designation has started using the Huron Shores Heritage Route name for the corridor. At the end of 2011, the Northeast Michigan Council of Governments (NEMCOG) was working on funding a tourist promotion called "Telling Stories of the Sunrise Coast" through the US 23 Heritage Route Interpretive Program. Past efforts by NEMCOG included print media, logos, and other marketing efforts.

MDOT maintains a listing of the historic bridges in the state; along US 23, the department has listed two structures. The bridge over the <a href="Ocqueoc%20River">Ocqueoc River</a> in <a href="Ocqueoc%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Ocqueoc Township</a> in Presque Isle County was built in 1937. The structure is one of the last three <a href="deck%20truss%20bridge">deck truss bridge</a>s in the state. The roadway on the bridge is wide and carries two lanes of traffic. The bridge was reconstructed in 1994.
The second bridge is the <a href="Cheboygan%20Bascule%20Bridge">Cheboygan Bascule Bridge</a> in Cheboygan. This <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> was built in 1940 over the Cheboygan River as the last of its kind before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was built as a "two-leaf bridge in a place where a single-leaf bridge probably would have sufficed." The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. It was the second moveable bridge on the site, replacing an iron <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a> built in 1877. The structure is long, composed of two spans on either side of the central span; the roadway is wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic. There are also pedestrian sidewalks on either side of the roadway. When the bridge is opened to allow river traffic to pass, boats have a channel for navigation. The bridge was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on December 1, 2000, and reconstructed in 2003.

William Garrow

Sir William Garrow (13 April 1760 – 24 September 1840) was an English <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, politician and judge known for his indirect reform of the advocacy system, which helped usher in the <a href="adversarial%20system">adversarial court system</a> used in most <a href="common%20law">common law</a> nations today. He introduced the phrase "<a href="Presumption%20of%20innocence">presumed innocent until proven guilty</a>", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court. Born to a priest and his wife in <a href="Monken%20Hadley">Monken Hadley</a>, then in Middlesex, Garrow was educated at his father's school in the village before being apprenticed to Thomas Southouse, an attorney in <a href="Cheapside">Cheapside</a>, which preceded a <a href="pupillage">pupillage</a> with Mr. Crompton, a <a href="special%20pleader">special pleader</a>. A dedicated student of the law, Garrow frequently observed cases at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>; as a result Crompton recommended that he become a solicitor or barrister. Garrow joined <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> in November 1778, and was <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a> on 27 November 1783. He quickly established himself as a <a href="English%20criminal%20law">criminal</a> defence counsel, and in February 1793 was made a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> by <a href="HM%20Government">HM Government</a> to prosecute cases involving treason and felonies.

He was elected to Parliament in 1805 for <a href="Gatton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Gatton</a>, a <a href="rotten%20borough">rotten borough</a>, and became <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General for England and Wales</a> in 1812 and <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General for England and Wales</a> a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been returned only for political purposes, Garrow acted as one of the principal <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Samuel Romilly</a> and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a <a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Baron of the Exchequer</a> and a <a href="Serjeant-at-Law">Serjeant-at-Law</a>, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on <a href="Assize%20Court">Assize</a>, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Councillor</a>, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.

For much of the 19th and 20th centuries his work was forgotten by academics, and interest arose only in 1991, with an article by John Beattie titled "Garrow for the Defence" in "<a href="History%20Today">History Today</a>". Garrow is best known for his criminal defence work, which, through the example he set with his aggressive defence of clients, helped establish the modern adversarial system in use in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other former British colonies. Garrow is also known for his impact on the rules of evidence, leading to the <a href="best%20evidence%20rule">best evidence rule</a>. His work was cited as recently as 1982 in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> and 2006 in the <a href="Court%20of%20Criminal%20Appeal%20%28Ireland%29">Irish Court of Criminal Appeal</a>. In 2009, <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> broadcast "<a href="Garrow%27s%20Law">Garrow's Law</a>", a four-part fictionalised drama of Garrow's beginnings at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>; a second series aired in late 2010. BBC One began broadcasting the third series in November 2011.

Garrow's family originally came from Moray <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, where they were descended from the Garriochs of Kinstair, a Scottish royal line. Garrow's father David was born at a farm called Knockside, Aberlour (Speyside) approximately 50 miles northwest of <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. David graduated from <a href="Aberdeen%20University">Aberdeen University</a> with a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Scotland%29">Master of Arts</a> degree on 1 April 1736, and became a priest of the Church of England, creating a school in <a href="Monken%20Hadley">Monken Hadley</a>. His younger brother William became a successful doctor, leaving most of his estate (£30,000) to Garrow. On 5 June 1748 David married Sarah Lowndes, with whom he had eleven children; William, Edward, Eleanora, Jane, John, Rose, William, Joseph, William, David and Anne. The first two Williams died as infants; the third, born on 13 April 1760, survived.

William Garrow was educated at his father's school in Monken Hadley, The Priory, which emphasised preparing students for commercial careers such as in the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. As such, it taught social graces, as well as English, Greek, Latin, French, geography, mathematics and dancing. Studying there Garrow "knew the English language well; had a moderate acquaintance with the Latin and, as an accomplishment, added a considerable proficiency in French". Garrow attended this school until he was 15, at which point he was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> to Thomas Southouse born Faversham, Kent?, an attorney in <a href="Cheapside">Cheapside</a>. Garrow showed potential, being noted as "attentive and diligent in the performance of the technical and practical duties of the office", and Southouse recommended that he become a solicitor or <a href="barrister">barrister</a>; as a result, when he was 17, he became a pupil of a Mr. Crompton, a <a href="special%20pleader">special pleader</a>. As a pupil Garrow studied hard, fastidiously reading Sampson Euer's "Doctrina Placitandi", a manual on the Law of Pleading written in <a href="Law%20French">legal French</a>. At the same time he viewed cases at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, forming a friendship with the clerk of arraignment there, William Shelton.

In the 18th century, speakers perfected the art of oratory through debating societies, one of the most noted of which met at Coachmaker's Hall, London. Although initially shy (during his first debate, the attendees had to force him from his seat and hold him up while he spoke), he swiftly developed a reputation as a speaker, and was referred to in the press as "Counsellor Garrow, the famous orator of Coachmaker's Hall". In November 1778, Garrow became a member of <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a>, one of the four <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inns of Court</a>, and on 27 November 1783 at the age of 23 he was <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a>; he later became a <a href="Bencher">Bencher</a> of Lincoln's Inn in 1793.

Garrow started as a criminal defence barrister at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, in a time where many defendants became increasingly reliant on barristers to prevent their conviction. His first case was actually as a prosecutor; on 14 January 1784, barely two months after he was <a href="called%20to%20the%20Bar">called to the Bar</a>, he prosecuted John Henry Aikles for obtaining a <a href="bill%20of%20exchange">bill of exchange</a> under false pretences. It was alleged that Aikles had promised to pay Samuel Edwards £100 and a small commission for a £100 bill of exchange, and when he took the bill, failed to hand over the money. Despite Aikles's counsel claiming, according to <a href="Edward%20Foss">Edward Foss</a>, that "this was no felony", and being represented by two of the most prestigious criminal barristers of the day, Garrow convinced both the judge and the jury that Aikles was guilty. Garrow later defended Aikles in September 1785, securing his release due to ill-health.

During his early years as a practising <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, Garrow was particularly noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence in the course of a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most <a href="thief-taker">thief-taker</a>s, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the <a href="Bow%20Street%20Runners">Bow Street Runners</a> and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.

Garrow made much use of <a href="jury%20nullification">jury nullification</a> to limit the punishment for his convicted clients, in a time when many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called <a href="Bloody%20Code">Bloody Code</a>). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.

Garrow soon developed a large practice, working criminal trials at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> and outside London as both defence counsel and prosecutor. By 1799, a book recorded that the number of cases he had at the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of King's Bench</a> "is exceeded by none but Mr. [Thomas] <a href="Thomas%20Erskine%2C%201st%20Baron%20Erskine">Erskine</a>'s", and that "he has long monopolized the chief business on the <a href="Circuit%20court">home circuit</a>... No man is heard with more attention by the court, no man gains more upon a jury, or better pleases a common auditor". In February 1793 he was appointed a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> to help prosecute those accused of treason and sedition, less than ten years after his <a href="call%20to%20the%20Bar">call to the Bar</a>; and his appointment was met with a mixed response from the media. "The Briton" described Garrow and the other five appointments as the best talent of the age, while the "<a href="Morning%20Chronicle">Morning Chronicle</a>" was bitter due to Garrow's previous status as a friend of the <a href="Official%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Official Opposition</a>, the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a>, as opposed to the <a href="Tory%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> <a href="HM%20Government">government</a>.

As the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and its perceived threat to the United Kingdom gained momentum, so did Garrow's career; he prosecuted in most of the state trials, and as he increased in experience was left to manage many of them himself, coming up against leading barristers such as Thomas Erskine, <a href="James%20Mingay">James Mingay</a> and <a href="James%20Scarlett%2C%201st%20Baron%20Abinger">James Scarlett</a>. In May 1794 the Government suspended "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>", in 1795 outlawed all public meetings, in 1797 outlawed secret organisations and in 1799 outlawed all societies interested in reforming the way the United Kingdom was run. The Government planned a series of 800 arrests, with 300 execution warrants for high treason made out and signed, making a particular effort to prosecute <a href="Thomas%20Hardy%20%28political%20reformer%29">Thomas Hardy</a> and <a href="John%20Horne%20Tooke">John Horne Tooke</a>. Hardy was the first to be tried, with the prosecution arguing that he sought a revolution in England similar to that in France. With Garrow prosecuting and Erskine defending, the trial lasted eight days instead of the normal one, and the foreman of the jury was so tense that he delivered the verdict of "not guilty" in a whisper and then immediately fainted. Tooke was then prosecuted; again, the jury found him not guilty, with the result that the other 800 trials were abandoned.

During the period when Garrow worked as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, the sugar planters of the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> held large amounts of power in Parliament, allowing them to maintain a monopoly on the marketing of sugar in England that brought great profits. This industry was largely profitable due to the use of slave labour, to which Garrow had long been opposed; when the sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business, he replied that "if your committee would give me their whole incomes, and all their estates, I would not be seen as the advocate of practices which I abhor, and a system which I detest". In 1806 <a href="Thomas%20Picton">Thomas Picton</a>, the Governor of <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, was charged with a single count of "causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted" on a young free mulatto girl; he was brought before the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of King's Bench</a> under <a href="Edward%20Law%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ellenborough">Lord Ellenborough</a>. The court records run to 367 pages, and Garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel; indeed, his opening speech on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be one of his best. The case centred on whether or not Spanish law, which allowed torture, was still in effect at the time of the incident. The jury eventually decided that it was not, and Ellenborough found Picton guilty. Picton's counsel requested a retrial, which was granted; the jury in the second trial eventually decided that Picton was innocent.

Thanks to Garrow's political connections, he was made first <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Cornwall">Solicitor General</a> and then Attorney General for the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> in 1806 and 1807; he was recommended by Erskine, who said in a letter to the Prince that "he knows more of the real justice and policy of everything connected with the criminal law than any man I am acquainted with". In 1812 he prosecuted <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a> for seditious libel against the <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a>; thanks to his work, Hunt was found guilty, reversing the judgment of an 1811 trial in which he had been acquitted.

Since 1789, the press had been speculating that Garrow, a <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a>, would enter Parliament; however he was first elected in 1805 for <a href="Gatton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Gatton</a>. This was a <a href="rotten%20borough">rotten borough</a>, with Garrow appointed to serve the interests of <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">his patron</a>. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> of <a href="Richard%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Wellesley">Marquess Wellesley</a>. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.

In June 1812, he was appointed <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General for England and Wales</a>, receiving the customary knighthood, and, in May 1813, he was appointed <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a>. The Attorney General was the senior Crown prosecutor, during a time when the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince Regent</a> feared liberal changes to the criminal law and Parliamentary structure. Garrow, as "a mere creature of the Regent", could be trusted to oppose this; rather than the progressive, defensive work undertaken in his early career, this period was one of conservative aggression against the reformers. Garrow ran particularly foul of <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Sir Samuel Romilly</a>, who was one of those looking to reform a penal code many claimed was not working. On 5 April 1813, Romilly's Bill on Attainder of Treason and Felony came before Parliament. Its intent was to remove <a href="Attainder">corruption of the blood</a> from cases involving treason and felony; Garrow, then Solicitor General, declared that the Bill would remove one of the safeguards of the British Constitution. The Bill eventually failed, and corruption of the blood was not removed from English law until the <a href="Forfeiture%20Act%201870">Forfeiture Act 1870</a>. He also served as <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Chester">Chief Justice of Chester</a> from 1814 to 1817.

Garrow also became involved in the repeal of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow was one of those who found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by <a href="Thomas%20Erskine%2C%201st%20Baron%20Erskine">Thomas Erskine</a>, which was given the <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the <a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Barons of the Exchequer</a>.

Garrow's first judicial appointment came in 1814, when he was made <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Chester">Chief Justice of Chester</a>. This was opposed by <a href="Samuel%20Romilly">Sir Samuel Romilly</a>, who argued that the positions of Chief Justice and Attorney General were incompatible, saying "to appoint a gentleman holding a lucrative office at the sole pleasure of the Crown to a high judicial situation, was extremely inconsistent with that independence of the judicial character which it was so important to preserve inviolate". On 6 May 1817, Garrow was made a <a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Baron of the Exchequer</a> and <a href="Serjeant-at-Law">Serjeant-at-Law</a>, succeeding <a href="Richard%20Richards%20%28MP%29">Richard Richards</a>, and resigning his seat in Parliament and his position as Attorney General. He was not a particularly distinguished judge in the Exchequer, mainly due to a lack of knowledge of the finer points of law. Practising on the <a href="Assize%20Court">Assize Circuits</a>, however, was a different matter; dealing with his more familiar criminal law rather than the commercial law of the Exchequer, Garrow performed far better. Braby indicates that he regularly amazed both <a href="barrister">barrister</a>s and defendants with his knowledge of the intricacies of crime. Garrow retired on 22 February 1832, replaced by <a href="John%20Gurney%20%28judge%29">John Gurney</a>, and was made a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Councillor</a> on retirement as a measure of the Government's respect for him. He died at home on 14 September 1840, aged 80.

Garrow had an irregular relationship with Sarah Dore, who had previously borne a son, William Arthur Dore Hill, by <a href="Arthur%20Hill%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Downshire">Arthur Hill, Viscount Fairford</a> in 1778. Thomas Hague has suggested that Dore was an Irish noblewoman Garrow had seduced, but the only intent of his writings was to disparage Garrow, and there is no evidence to support his claim. Their first child, David William Garrow, was born on 15 April 1781, and their second, Eliza Sophia Garrow, was born on 18 June 1784. Garrow and Dore finally married on 17 March 1793. Dore was noted as particularly elegant, and was actively involved in local matters in <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>, where the family lived. Dore died on 30 June 1808 after a long illness, and was buried at the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Margaret%20of%20Antioch%2C%20Darenth">Church of St Margaret</a>, <a href="Darenth">Darenth</a>. David William Garrow was educated at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, earning the degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Divinity">Doctor of Divinity</a>, and served as one of the Chaplains to the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. Eliza Sophia Garrow married Samuel Fothergill Lettsom; one of her children, also named William Garrow, served as the Consul-General of <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>.

Garrow's estate was valued at £22,000 after his death near Ramsgate, Kent, including £12,000 in the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>, £5,000 in three insurance policies and £5,000 secured by mortgages – a total of £ in 2019 terms. Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; to set up a trust and to be buried in his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune). The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a> and <a href="William%20Nanson%20Lettsom">William Nanson Lettsom</a> of <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a>. The money was divided between <a href="Theodosia%20Abrams%20Fisher">Joseph Garrow</a>, Garrow's nephew, who received £1,000, £200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, £2,000 to the sister and £300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received £300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an additional provision of £200 for the joint use of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of <a href="St%20Laurence%2C%20Ramsgate">St Laurence, Ramsgate</a>, his parish church.

<a href="Edward%20Foss">Edward Foss</a> described him as "one of the most successful advocates of his day", something linked more to his "extraordinary talent" at cross-examination than his knowledge of the law; Garrow once told a witness before a case that "you know a particular fact and wish to conceal it – I'll get it out of you!" <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Lord Brougham</a>, who regularly opposed him in court, wrote that "no description can give the reader an adequate idea of this eminent practitioner's powers in thus dealing with a witness". Lemmings notes Garrow as not only a formidable advocate but also the "first lawyer to establish a reputation as a defence barrister".

Garrow was largely forgotten; although <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> and his wife discovered his work a generation later when reading transcripts of Old Bailey cases, there was little academic work on him until the late 20th century. In 1991, John Beattie published "Garrow for the Defence" in "<a href="History%20Today">History Today</a>", followed by "Scales of Justice: Defence Counsel and the English Criminal Law in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries" in "Law and History Review". Allyson May, who did her doctoral study under Beattie, further extended the analysis of Garrow's work with "The Bar and the Old Bailey: 1750–1850", published in 2003.

Garrow's work was cited in court as recently as 1982, when the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> quoted a passage from "The Trial of William Davidson and Richard Tidd for High Treason", where Garrow instructed the jury as to how to interpret testimony, in "Vetrovec v The Queen" in 1982. In 2006 he was again quoted, when the <a href="Court%20of%20Criminal%20Appeal%20%28Ireland%29">Irish Court of Criminal Appeal</a> used the same work in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of <a href="Veronica%20Guerin">Veronica Guerin</a>.

In 2009, <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> broadcast "<a href="Garrow%27s%20Law">Garrow's Law</a>", a four-part fictionalised drama of Garrow's beginnings at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, starring <a href="Andrew%20Buchan">Andrew Buchan</a> as Garrow. A second series, again of four parts, was aired in late 2010, and the third and final four-part series was broadcast in November and December 2011.

It is indisputable that Garrow massively affected the modern, adversarial court system used in several western nations and the rules of evidence, although he was barely aware of it. Prior to Garrow's time, defendants in felony cases were not allowed to have defence counsel; as a result, every defendant for arson, rape, robbery, murder and most forms of theft was forced to defend themselves. The first step away from this was with the <a href="Trials%20Act%201696">Trials Act 1696</a>, which allowed treason defendants the right to a counsel. Garrow's practice was a further step forward; with his aggressive and forthright style of cross-examination, he promoted a more committed defence of clients, and indirectly reformed the process of advocacy in the 18th century. His area of advocacy (he was counsel for the defence in 83% of his cases) and style is considered key by Beattie in establishing the "new school" of advocacy; his aggressive style in defence set a new style for advocates to follow that assisted in counteracting a legal system biased against the defendant. While he was not the sole cause of this reform, his position at the head of the Bar meant that he served as a highly visible example for new barristers to take after. In some ways Garrow was far ahead of his time; he coined the phrase "<a href="innocent%20until%20proven%20guilty">innocent until proven guilty</a>" in 1791, although the jury refused to accept this principle and it was not confirmed by the courts until much later.

Garrow also influenced the rules of evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the <a href="best%20evidence%20rule">best evidence rule</a>. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting <a href="Evidence%20%28law%29">evidence</a>, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge to insist that the advocates have independence in submitting it. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority. While this increased towards the end of the 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts, Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross-examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's medical expert to admit that he could not prove how Delew had died. Garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively "interrogate" such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).

Interstate 69 in Michigan

Interstate 69 (I-69) is a part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> that will eventually run from the <a href="Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Mexican border</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> to the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a> at <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron, Michigan</a>. In <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, it is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that enters the state south of <a href="Coldwater%2C%20Michigan">Coldwater</a> and passes the cities of <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> and <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a> in the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula">Lower Peninsula</a>. A north–south freeway from the Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west after <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">running concurrently</a> with <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a>. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> while running concurrently with <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> at the border. There are four related <a href="Business%20routes%20of%20Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">business loop</a>s for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.

Predecessors to I-69 include the first <a href="M-29%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-29</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 27</a> (US 27), <a href="M-78%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-78</a> and <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a>. The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US 27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Indiana–Michigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002.

The entirety of I-69 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, which is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway carries 91,100 vehicles <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">on average each day</a> between <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a> and <a href="M-54%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-54</a> in <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a> and 14,085 vehicles between <a href="M-53%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-53</a> and Capac Road near the <a href="Lapeer%20County%2C%20Michigan">Lapeer</a>–<a href="St.%20Clair%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair</a> county line, the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2012, respectively. I-69 carries the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> in the <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> area and the I-69 Recreational Heritage Route from the Indiana state line north to the <a href="Calhoun%20County%2C%20Michigan">Calhoun</a>–<a href="Eaton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Eaton</a> county line. I-69 is mostly a four-lane freeway in the state of Michigan, with exceptions in the Lansing and Flint metro areas where it is six lanes and in Port Huron where it is three lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound until eastbound traffic splits into six lanes of local traffic to Port Huron and two lanes to the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a>.

I-69 in Michigan begins at the Indiana state line southeast of <a href="Kinderhook%2C%20Michigan">Kinderhook</a> and just north of an interchange with the <a href="Indiana%20Toll%20Road">Indiana Toll Road</a>, which carries <a href="Interstate%2080%20in%20Indiana">I-80</a> and <a href="Interstate%2090%20in%20Indiana">I-90</a>. From there, I-69 runs northward through a mixture of <a href="Southern%20Michigan">Southern Michigan</a> farmland and woodland in <a href="Branch%20County%2C%20Michigan">Branch County</a>. A few miles north of the state line, the freeway passes <a href="Coldwater%20Lake%20State%20Park">Coldwater Lake State Park</a> and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there is a <a href="welcome%20center">welcome center</a> for the northbound lanes. I-69 curves around the east side of <a href="Coldwater%2C%20Michigan">Coldwater</a>, connecting to the city's <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Coldwater%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop</a> on the south of town. Immediately east of downtown, the freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop at an interchange that also features <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> (Chicago Road). Farther north, the freeway turns to the northwest, crosses into Calhoun County and then over the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a>. I-69 turns back northward and bypasses <a href="Tekonsha%2C%20Michigan">Tekonsha</a> to the town's west, intersecting <a href="M-60%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-60</a> in the process.

Curving around <a href="Nottawa%20Lake">Nottawa Lake</a>, I-69 continues northward through southern Calhoun County. It passes through an interchange that marks the southern terminus of <a href="M-227%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-227</a>, a highway that connects northward into <a href="Marshall%2C%20Michigan">Marshall</a>. The freeway crosses the <a href="Kalamazoo%20River">Kalamazoo River</a> and passes through an interchange with <a href="M-96%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-96</a> west of downtown Marshall. From that interchange northward, the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Marshall%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-94</a> designation is overlaid on I-69; the business loop ends at the <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> northwest of Marshall that marks the first of I-69's two junctions with I-94 in the state . North of I-94, I-69 has one more interchange at N Drive North before crossing into Eaton County.
In southern Eaton County, the freeway parallels the <a href="Battle%20Creek%20River">Battle Creek River</a> north of the junction with <a href="M-78%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-78</a>. Near <a href="Olivet%2C%20Michigan">Olivet</a>, I-69 begins to turn in a northeasterly direction and curves around the north side of town. On the south side of <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Michigan">Charlotte</a>, I-69 turns northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US 27, which is now part of the <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Charlotte%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop for the city</a>. Farther north, the freeway has a junction with <a href="M-50%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-50</a>, a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to <a href="Fitch%20H.%20Beach%20Airport">Fitch H. Beach Airport</a>. North of the airport, I-69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road, the former route of US 27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of <a href="M-100%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-100</a> near <a href="Potterville%2C%20Michigan">Potterville</a> and continues into the Lansing–<a href="East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan">East Lansing</a> metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69 crosses over Lansing Road near <a href="Lansing%20Delta%20Township%20Assembly">Lansing Delta Township Assembly</a>, a factory for <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>; northeast of the complex, I-69 merges into I-96. The combined I-96/I-69 runs northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of <a href="Interstate%20496">I-496</a> and the <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-69 for Lansing</a>. The freeway enters <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Clinton County</a>, and just north of a crossing of the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a>, I-69 turns eastward to separate from I-96. As a part of the larger interchange with I-96, I-69 crosses <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-96</a> (<a href="Grand%20River%20Avenue">Grand River Avenue</a>) without any connections.

After leaving the I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes cardinal orientation and is signed as east–west from that point on. The freeway continues parallel to the <a href="Looking%20Glass%20River">Looking Glass River</a> through suburban areas north of <a href="Capital%20Region%20International%20Airport">Capital Region International Airport</a>. North of East Lansing, I-69 meets <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a> at a cloverleaf interchange. East of that junction, I-69 turns southeasterly passing the <a href="Hawk%20Hollow%20Golf%20Course">Hawk Hollow Golf Course</a> and Park Lake on the way to meet the eastern end of BL I-69 just north of <a href="Lake%20Lansing">Lake Lansing</a>. I-69 then turns northeasterly parallel to Lansing Road (Old M-78) to enter <a href="Shiawassee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Shiawassee County</a>. The freeway continues through <a href="Central%20Michigan">Central Michigan</a> farmlands, jogging north of <a href="Perry%2C%20Michigan">Perry</a> and <a href="Bancroft%2C%20Michigan">Bancroft</a>.
At <a href="Durand%2C%20Michigan">Durand</a>, I-69 meets the southeastern end of <a href="M-71%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-71</a> on the northwest side of town. The freeway turns sharply to the northeast before turning due east near <a href="Lennon%2C%20Michigan">Lennon</a>. The interchange with <a href="M-13%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-13</a> south of Lennon marks the Shiawassee–<a href="Genesee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Genesee</a> county line. Continuing eastward, I-69 parallels Miller Road to the north as far as the city of <a href="Swartz%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Swartz Creek</a>; east of town, the two roadways cross. I-69 parallels a line of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> as it enters the Flint metro area. The freeway intersects Bristol Road near the <a href="Bishop%20International%20Airport">Bishop International Airport</a> and then crosses <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> southwest of downtown Flint. I-69, the railroad and the <a href="Swartz%20Creek">Swartz Creek</a> all parallel into downtown Flint where the freeway intersects I-475 and M-54 (Dort Highway) before exiting the east side of the city.

I-69 runs eastward out of Flint parallel to the railroad. At <a href="Davison%2C%20Michigan">Davison</a>, it intersects <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a> before crossing into Lapeer County. In this area, the freeway traverses farmlands in the southern part of the region called <a href="The%20Thumb">The Thumb</a>. It jogs to the north around <a href="Lake%20Nepessing">Lake Nepessing</a>, which is southwest of <a href="Lapeer%2C%20Michigan">Lapeer</a>. The freeway continues through farmland to <a href="Imlay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Imlay City</a>, where it meets M-53 before crossing into western St. Clair County. I-69 continues eastward through an interchange with <a href="M-19%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-19</a> at <a href="Emmett%2C%20Michigan">Emmett</a>.
Near <a href="Wadhams%2C%20Michigan">Wadhams</a>, I-69 curves around to the north to follow part of the <a href="Black%20River%20%28St.%20Clair%20County%29">Black River</a>. On the east side of the community, the freeway turns back to the southeast as it enters the western edge of the Port Huron suburbs. I-69 turns again to run due eastward to intersect I-94. The two freeways merge in an interchange that also has connections to <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-69</a>. The freeway curves to the north and back around to the east to cross the Black River. On the eastern bank, I-94/I-69 travels through one more interchange, this one for <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> and BL I-69/<a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-94</a>. Past the interchange, the freeway crosses through the toll and <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">customs</a> plazas for the twin-span <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a>. The I-69 designation officially ends at the international boundary in the middle of the St. Clair River where it connects with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20402">Highway 402</a>.

The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. None of these followed the path of the modern I-69 however.
The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a>; at the time, none of the system's divisions corresponded to the modern I-69 either. In 1919, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) was required to signpost the highway system for the first time, and the state became the second after Wisconsin to do so. At the time, two different highways followed sections of the modern I-69 corridor. The original <a href="M-29%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-29</a> ran from the Indiana state line north to <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Michigan">Charlotte</a> and turned northeasterly to <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a>. The second highway was <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a> from Flint east to <a href="Goodells%2C%20Michigan">Goodells</a>, a community west of <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>; the highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924.

On November 11, 1926, the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was approved by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO), and the new <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing. By the end of the next year, <a href="M-78%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-78</a> was extended from Charlotte north and east of Lansing to a junction with <a href="M-47%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-47</a> near <a href="Pittsburg%2C%20Michigan">Pittsburg</a>, north of the modern I-69. The section of M-78 north of Lansing was changed in 1929; the segment from Dewitt to Pittsburg was redesignated <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a>, and M-78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through <a href="East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan">East Lansing</a> to <a href="Haslett%2C%20Michigan">Haslett</a>. By 1936, M-78 was extended from Haslett all the way into <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a> to end at M-21. The first span of the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> opened between Port Huron and <a href="Point%20Edward%2C%20Ontario">Point Edward, Ontario</a>, in 1938.

The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> did not include a highway along I-69's route; instead a highway further west connecting <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a>, with <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> was included. This alternative highway was maintained on the 1955 plan for the "National System of Interstate and Defense Highways", and numbered I-67 in August 1957. By June 1958, this freeway had been shifted further east and renumbered I-69, connecting <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>, with <a href="Marshall%2C%20Michigan">Marshall</a>; no connections north and east to Lansing, Flint or Port Huron were planned as part of the Interstate Highway System. Around the same time, a section of <a href="M-146%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-146</a> near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge.

By the middle of 1960, the first section of freeway along M-78 was opened in the <a href="Lennon%2C%20Michigan">Lennon</a> area. The next year, the freeway had been extended as far southwest as <a href="Durand%2C%20Michigan">Durand</a> from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US 27 south of Lansing be built as an <a href="Intelligent%20transportation%20system">electronic highway</a> under a bid through <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> instead.
By the start of 1962, M-78 was a freeway from <a href="Perry%2C%20Michigan">Perry</a> at the junction with M-47 all the way to <a href="Swartz%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Swartz Creek</a> near Flint. On December 12, 1962, I-96 was completed around the Lansing area, and M-78 was rerouted to follow it. A year later, <a href="Interstate%20496">I-496</a> was partially opened through the Lansing area, and M-78 was routed to follow it as well; the former route through downtown was redesignated <a href="M-78%20%28Michigan%20highway%29%23Business%20route">Business M-78</a> (Bus. M-78). Around the same time, I-94 was extended along the Blue Water Bridge approach freeway.

The first freeway segment of M-21 on the east end was built from <a href="Wadhams%2C%20Michigan">Wadhams</a> to Port Huron in 1966. The next year, M-78's freeway was extended eastward to <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> in Flint. On October 11, 1967, the first segment of I-69/US 27 was scheduled to open between the Indiana state line and <a href="Tekonsha%2C%20Michigan">Tekonsha</a>. By the end of the year, the freeway extended north to <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> northwest of Marshall. The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the <a href="Federal-Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201968">Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968</a> including an extension of I-69 from Marshall to Port Huron; this extension was approved as far as I-75/US 23 in Flint on December 13, 1968.

A discontinuous section of M-78 freeway east of Flint was completed in 1969. The same year, <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a> was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway, after the <a href="David%20Dunbar%20Buick">founder</a> of <a href="Buick">Buick Motor Company</a> in Flint; the same legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 22 of 1969 named the M-78 freeway through Flint for <a href="Louis%20Chevrolet">Louis Chevrolet</a>. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and <a href="M-54%20Business%20%28Flint%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-54</a> was redesignated <a href="M-56%20%281971%E2%80%931987%20Michigan%20highway%29">M-56</a>. The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after a Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69) designation was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry. On September 4 of that year, I-69's designation was officially extended by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to end at I-475 on the east side of Flint; this extension, and all subsequent ones, was of "<a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System%23Chargeable%20and%20non-chargeable%20Interstate%20routes">non-chargeable mileage</a>", or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund.
In 1980, a Flint-area politician wanted to dedicate a highway after the <a href="United%20Auto%20Workers">United Auto Workers</a> (UAW). As a result, the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I-475 and applied to I-69 in Flint. The <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) approved the extension of the I-69 designation eastward in 1983 so that it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20standards">Interstate Highway standards</a> and other appropriate approvals at the federal government level. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I-69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time. M-21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M-56 through the city. The former route of M-21 in Port Huron became <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-69</a>, and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control. The I-69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10, 1987; this last extension designated I-69 all the way to I-94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings.

Another segment of freeway opened in 1987 in <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Clinton County</a> between <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a> near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near <a href="Bath%2C%20Michigan">Bath</a>. This section was connected to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor <a href="John%20Engler">John Engler</a>. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US 27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit 87) and then concurrent with US 127 to exit 89 before running alone to Port Huron.

A second span of the Blue Water Bridge between Port Huron and Point Edward opened in July 1997. The St. Johns Bypass on US 27 opened on August 31, 1998; US 27 was extended along I-69 about to the connect to the bypass, and US 127 was simultaneously removed from I-69. The next year, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change.
On July 23, 2001, the Michigan Legislature declared that I-69 from exit 105 in <a href="Shiawassee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Shiawassee County</a> east to exit 135 in <a href="Genesee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Genesee County</a> would be named the <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> Memorial Highway. In October 2001, the legislature consolidated the various legislation that created memorial highway designations in the state. Public Act 142 of 2001 extended the merged Chevrolet–Buick Freeway name to all of I-69 in Genesee County, and restored the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name to I-475. The I-69 Recreational Heritage Route (now a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>) was created on October 8, 2004, to follow the freeway in <a href="Branch%20County%2C%20Michigan">Branch</a> and <a href="Calhoun%20County%2C%20Michigan">Calhoun</a> counties. The Branch County segment was also dedicated as the Purple Heart Trail on July 17, 2006.

In 2011, construction began to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic with a new permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated <a href="GPS">GPS</a> devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.

In late 2013, construction began to reconstruct and reconfigure the I-94/I-69 interchange near Port Huron. The project will improve of freeway, replace several bridges and ramps and cost $76 million. In June 2014, MDOT closed the ramps from I-69 eastbound to BL I-69 through the interchange until later in the year. The project was completed in September 2015.

In Michigan, I-69 currently has four <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s. These highways, each designated Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69), provide access from the main freeway through the downtown districts of adjacent cities. They follow former routings used by I-69's predecessor highways (US 27, M-78 and M-21) as well connecting roads. The cities served by these loops are: <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Coldwater%2C%20Michigan%29">Coldwater</a>, <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Charlotte%2C%20Michigan%29">Charlotte</a>, <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">Lansing</a>, and <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">Port Huron</a>.

Cleomenean War

The Cleomenean War (229/228–222 BC) was fought by <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> and its ally, <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, against the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a> and <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>. The war ended in a Macedonian and Achaean victory.

In 235 BC, <a href="Cleomenes%20III">Cleomenes III</a> ( 235–222 BC) ascended the throne of Sparta and began a program of reform aimed at restoring traditional Spartan discipline while weakening the influence of the <a href="ephor">ephor</a>s, elected officials who, though sworn to uphold the rule of Sparta's kings, had by the time of Cleomenes come to wield extraordinary political power in the Spartan system. When, in 229 BC, the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize a town on the border with <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a>, the Achaeans declared war. Cleomenes responded by ravaging <a href="Achaea%20%28ancient%20region%29">Achaea</a>. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Lycaeum">Mount Lycaeum</a> he defeated an army under <a href="Aratus%20of%20Sicyon">Aratus of Sicyon</a>, the <a href="strategos">strategos</a> of the Achaean League, that had been sent to attack Elis, and then routed a second army near Megalopolis.

In quick succession, Cleomenes cleared the cities of <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a> of their Achaean garrisons, before crushing another Achaean force at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyme">Dyme</a>. Facing Spartan domination, Aratus was forced to turn to <a href="Antigonus%20III%20Doson">Antigonus III Doson</a> ( 229–221 BC) of Macedon. In return for Macedonian assistance, the Achaeans were obliged to surrender the citadel overlooking <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a> to Antigonus. Cleomenes eventually invaded Achaea, seizing control of Corinth and <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, but was forced to retreat to <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> when Antigonus arrived in the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. Cleomenes fought the Achaeans and the Macedonians at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sellasia">Sellasia</a>, where the Spartans were routed. He then fled to the court of his ally, <a href="Ptolemy%20III%20of%20Egypt">Ptolemy III of Egypt</a> ( 246–222 BC), where he ultimately committed suicide in the wake of a failed revolt against the new <a href="List%20of%20pharaohs%23Ptolemaic%20Dynasty">Pharaoh</a>, <a href="Ptolemy%20IV">Ptolemy IV</a> ( 221–205 BC).

<a href="Cleomenes%20III">Cleomenes III</a> ascended the throne of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, <a href="Leonidas%20II">Leonidas II</a>. His accession to power ended a decade-long period of heightened conflict between the two royal families. <a href="Spartan%20Constitution%23Dual%20Kingship">Sparta's ancient dual kingship</a> was explained by the founding legend that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed his rival king, the reformist <a href="Agis%20IV">Agis IV</a>.

In 229 BC, Cleomenes took the important cities <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>, <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a>, <a href="Caphyae">Caphyae</a> and <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Arcadia%29">Orchomenus</a> in <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, who had by then allied themselves with the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a>, a powerful Greek confederation of <a href="city%20state">city state</a>s in central Greece. Historians <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> and <a href="Sir%20William%20Smith">Sir William Smith</a> claim that Cleomenes seized the cities by treachery; however, Richard Talbert, who translated Plutarch's account of Sparta, and historian <a href="N.%20G.%20L.%20Hammond">N. G. L. Hammond</a> say Cleomenes occupied them at their own request. Later that year, the <a href="ephors">ephors</a> sent Cleomenes to seize the Athenaeum, near Belbina. Belbina was one of the entrance points into <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> and was disputed at the time between Sparta and <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a>. Meanwhile, the Achaean League summoned a meeting of her assembly and declared war against Sparta. Cleomenes in return fortified his position.

<a href="Aratus%20of%20Sicyon">Aratus of Sicyon</a>, the <a href="strategos">strategos</a> of the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>, tried to re-take Tegea and Orchomenus in a night attack. Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes nonetheless discovered the plan and sent a message to Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: "If it's all the same to you, write and tell me why you brought along those torches and ladders."

After fortifying Belbina, Cleomenes advanced into Arcadia with 3,000 <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and a few <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>. However, he was called back by the ephors, and this retreat allowed Aratus to seize Caphyae as soon as Cleomenes returned to Laconia. Once this news reached Sparta, the ephors sent Cleomenes out again; he managed to capture the Megalopian city Methydrium before ravaging the territory surrounding <a href="Argos">Argos</a>.

Around this time, the Achaean League sent an army under a new strategos—<a href="Aristomachos%20of%20Argos">Aristomachos of Argos</a>, who had been elected in May 228 BC—to meet Cleomenes in battle. The Achaean army of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at <a href="Pallantium%20%28Greece%29">Pallantium</a>. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachos, advised him to retreat because even 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans. Aristomachos, listening to Aratus' advice, retreated with the Achaean army.

Meanwhile, <a href="Ptolemy%20III">Ptolemy III</a> of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, who had been an ally of the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his financial support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta would be a more valuable ally against Macedon than a failing Achaean League.

In May 227 BC, Aratus was once again elected strategos and attacked <a href="Elis">Elis</a>. The Elians appealed to Sparta for aid; as the Achaeans were returning from Elis, Cleomenes attacked and routed their entire army near Mount Lycaeum. Taking advantage of a rumour that he had been killed during the fighting, Aratus attacked and seized Mantinea.

Meanwhile, the <a href="Kings%20of%20Sparta">Eurypontid King</a> of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, the Greek writer, claims that Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to strengthen his position against the ephors, who were opposed to his <a href="expansionist">expansionist</a> policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle <a href="Archidamus%20V">Archidamus V</a> from his exile in <a href="Messene">Messene</a> to ascend the Eurypontid throne, but as soon as Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.

Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors to allow him to continue his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of <a href="Leuctra">Leuctra</a>. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based nearest the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but <a href="Lydiadas%20of%20Megalopolis">Lydiadas of Megalopolis</a> disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans. Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his <a href="Crete">Cretan</a> and <a href="Taranto">Tarentine</a> soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.

Cleomenes, now confident of the strength of his position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him of the need to do away with the ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and <a href="Asea%2C%20Greece">Asea</a>. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.

With the ephors vanquished, Cleomenes initiated his reforms. First, he handed over his land to the state; he was soon followed by his stepfather and his friends, and then by the rest of the citizens. He divided up all of the Spartan land, awarding an equal lot to each citizen. He increased the citizen population by granting citizenship to some <a href="perioeci">perioeci</a>, who constituted the Spartan middle class, but did not at that time have Spartan citizenship. Expanding the citizen population meant that Cleomenes could build a larger army; he trained 4,000 <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline. He also strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian <a href="sarissa">sarissa</a> (pike). Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, <a href="Eucleidas">Eucleidas</a>, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.

<a href="Ptolemy%20III%20of%20Egypt">Ptolemy III of Egypt</a> offered continued assistance to Cleomenes on the condition that the Spartan king would offer his mother and children as hostages. Cleomenes hesitated but his mother, after learning of Ptolemy's offer, went voluntarily to Egypt.

In 226 BC, the citizens of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the citadel and removed the Achaean garrison before marching off to nearby Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into <a href="Achaea">Achaea</a>, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to <a href="Dyme%2C%20Greece">Dyme</a>, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyme">Battle of Dyme</a>, the Spartans routed the Achaean <a href="phalanx%20formation">phalanx</a>, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.

The Achaeans were demoralized by this battle; Aratus declined the generalship, and when both <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, but as the talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, he would return to the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to <a href="Lerna">Lerna</a>, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too much water, which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.

Aratus took advantage of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King <a href="Antigonus%20III%20Doson">Antigonus III Doson</a> of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis had been sent to Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of <a href="Acrocorinth">Acrocorinth</a> in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.

When the Achaeans arrived at Argos for an assembly, Cleomenes came down from Tegea to meet them. However, Aratus—who had reached an agreement with Antigonus—demanded that Cleomenes present 300 hostages to the Achaeans and enter the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, he declared that he had been wronged and once again declared war on the Achaeans.

Achaea was now in turmoil, and some cities were close to revolt; many residents were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a> and <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities and then went to Argos to celebrate the <a href="Nemean%20Games">Nemean Games</a>.

Cleomenes estimated that Argos would be easier to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a>, one of the most famous generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.

Soon after the seizure of Argos, <a href="Cleonae%20%28Argolis%29">Cleonae</a> and <a href="Phlius">Phlius</a> surrendered themselves to Cleomenes. Meanwhile, Aratus was in Corinth investigating those suspected of supporting Sparta. When he heard what had happened at Argos, Aratus expected the city to fall to Sparta. He summoned an assembly and, with all the citizens present, he took his horse and fled to <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>. The Corinthians did surrender the city to Cleomenes, but the Spartan king criticized them for failing to arrest Aratus. Cleomenes sent his stepfather Megistonous to Aratus, asking for the surrender of <a href="Acrocorinth">Acrocorinth</a>—the <a href="citadel">citadel</a> of Corinth, which had an Achaean garrison—in return for a large amount of money.

In quick succession, <a href="Ermioni">Hermione</a>, <a href="Troezen">Troezen</a> and <a href="Epidaurus">Epidaurus</a> surrendered to Cleomenes, who went from Argos to Corinth and started besieging the citadel. He sent a messenger to Aratus proposing that Acrocorinth should be garrisoned jointly by both the Spartans and the Achaeans, and that he would deliver a twelve <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talent</a> pension. Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let it fall to Cleomenes. He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon. Cleomenes invaded the territory of Sicyon and blockaded Aratus inside the city for three months before Aratus was able to escape to attend the Achaean council at Aegium.

Antigonus, who had brought with him a large force of 20,000 infantry and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> towards the Peloponnese. The hostile <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a> occupying parts of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>, despite their neutrality at that point in the war. Aratus met Antigonus at <a href="Pagae">Pagae</a>, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving <a href="Megara">Megara</a> to <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and <a href="palisade">palisade</a> running from Acrocorinth to the <a href="Isthmus">Isthmus</a>. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.

Despite numerous attempts to break through the defensive line and reach <a href="Lechaeum">Lechaeum</a>, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, <a href="Timoxenos">Timoxenos</a>, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was in the hands of the Argives.

When Cleomenes heard about the revolt at Argos, he sent his stepfather with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus for fear of being encircled and left Corinth to fall into the hands of Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.

After retreating into Arcadia and receiving news of his wife's death, Cleomenes returned to Sparta. This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum—which he gave to Megalopolis. He continued to <a href="Aegium">Aegium</a>, where the Achaeans were holding their council. He gave a report on his operations and was made chief-in-command of all the allied forces.

Antigonus took the opportunity to revive the <a href="League%20of%20Corinth">Hellenic League</a> of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, under the name League of Leagues. Most of the Greek city states took part in the league. These included Macedon, Achaea, Boeotia, Thessaly, <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>, <a href="Locris">Locris</a>, <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>, Euboea and <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epiros</a>. <a href="Peter%20Green%20%28historian%29">Peter Green</a> claims that for Antigonus, the League was just a way to further Macedon's power.

In the early spring of 223 BC, Antigonus advanced upon <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held out for a few days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke <a href="military%20camp">camp</a> and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.

Knowing that Cleomenes got the money to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, according to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money to pay for his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all <a href="helots">helots</a> able to pay five Attic <a href="Mina%20%28unit%29">minae</a>; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in <a href="Macedonian%20phalanx">Macedonian style</a> to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.

Cleomenes noted that Antigonus had dismissed his Macedonian troops and only traveled with his mercenaries. At the time Antigonus was in Aegium, a three-day march from Megalopolis. Most of the Achaeans of military age had been killed at Mount Lycaeum and Ladoceia. Cleomenes ordered his army to take five days' worth of rations and sent his troops toward <a href="Sellasia">Sellasia</a>, to give the appearance of raiding the territory of Argos. From there he went to the territory of Megalopolis; during the night he ordered one of his friends, Panteus, to capture the weakest section of the walls, while Cleomenes and the rest of the army followed. Panteus managed to capture that section of the wall after killing the sentries. This allowed Cleomenes and the rest of the Spartan army to enter the city.

When dawn came, the Megalopolitans realised that the Spartans had entered the city; some of them fled, while others stood and fought against the invaders. Cleomenes' superior numbers forced the defenders to retreat, but their rearguard action allowed most of the population to escape—only 1,000 were captured. Cleomenes sent a message to <a href="Messene">Messene</a>, where the exiles had gathered, offering to give back their city if they became his allies. The Megalopolitans refused; in retaliation the Spartans ransacked the city and burnt it to the ground. Nicholas Hammond estimated that Cleomenes managed to accumulate around 300 talents of loot from the city.

The destruction of Megalopolis shook the Achaean League. Cleomenes set off with his army to raid the territory of Argos, knowing that Antigonus would not resist him due to a lack of men. Cleomenes also hoped that his raid would cause the Argives to lose confidence in Antigonus because of his failure to protect their territory. Walbank describes this raid as being "an impressive demonstration, but it had no effect other than to make it even more clear that Cleomenes had to be defeated in a pitched battle."

In the summer of 222 BC, Antigonus summoned his troops from Macedon, who arrived together with other allied forces. According to Polybius, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 Macedonian infantry, most of them armed as <a href="phalangites">phalangites</a>, 3,000 <a href="peltasts">peltasts</a>, 1,200 cavalry, 3,000 mercenaries, 8,600 Greek allies, and 3,000 Achaean infantry, making a total of 29,200 men.

Cleomenes had fortified all the passes into Laconia with barricades and trenches before setting off with his army of 20,000 men to the pass at <a href="Sellasia">Sellasia</a>, on the northern border of Laconia. Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.

When Antigonus reached Sellasia with his army, he found it well guarded and decided against storming the strong position. Instead he pitched camp near Sellasia and waited for several days. During this time, he sent scouts to <a href="reconnoiter">reconnoiter</a> the areas and feign attacks on Cleomenes' position.

Unable to force a move from Cleomenes, Antigonus decided to risk a pitched battle. He positioned some of his Macedonian infantry and <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> facing the Evas hill in an articulated phalanx. The Epirots, the Acarnanians and 2,000 Achaean infantry stood behind them as reinforcements. The cavalry took a position opposite Cleomenes' cavalry, with 1,000 Achaean and Megalopolitan infantry in reserve. Together with the rest of his Macedonian infantry and mercenaries Antigonus took his position opposite that of Cleomenes.

The battle started when the Illyrian troops on the Macedonian right wing attacked the Spartan force on Evas. The Spartan light infantry and cavalry, noticing that the Achaean infantry was not protected at the rear, launched an assault on the back of the Macedonian right wing, and threatened to rout it. However, at the critical moment, <a href="Philopoemon">Philopoemon</a> of Megalopolis (who later became one of the greatest heroes of the Achaean League, eventually conquering Sparta), tried to point out the danger to the senior cavalry commanders. When they did not take notice of him, Philopoemon gathered a few other cavalrymen and charged the Spartan cavalry. The Spartans attacking from the rear broke off their engagement with the enemy, which encouraged the Macedonians to charge at the Spartan positions. The Spartans' left flank was eventually forced back and thrown from their position and their commander, Eucleidas, killed; they fled the field.

Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on the left flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a considerable amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape with a small group of men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought survived the battle.

Following his defeat at Sellasia, Cleomenes briefly returned to Sparta and urged the citizens to accept Antigonus' terms. Under cover of darkness, he fled from Sparta with some friends and went to the city's port of <a href="Gythium">Gythium</a>, where he boarded a ship heading to Egypt.

Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, its first foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the population generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, although he did not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a> invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.

On his arrival at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Cleomenes was greeted by Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with him any hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak <a href="Ptolemy%20IV">Ptolemy IV</a> ascended the throne.

Ptolemy IV began treating Cleomenes with neglect and soon his chief minister, <a href="Sosibius">Sosibius</a>, had Cleomenes put under house arrest after he was falsely accused of plotting against the king. In 219 BC, Cleomenes and his friends escaped from house arrest and ran through the streets of Alexandria, trying to encourage an uprising against Ptolemy. When this failed, Cleomenes and all of his friends committed suicide.

Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory

The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory is a historical <a href="observatory">observatory</a> located on the grounds of the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by <a href="Edward%20Sabine">Edward Sabine</a> to determine the cause of fluctuations in <a href="magnetic%20declination">magnetic declination</a>. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that <a href="sunspot">sunspot</a>s were responsible for this effect on <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a>. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.

<a href="Compass">Compass</a>es tended to "wander" from north when measurements were taken at different locations or even at a single location over a period of time. The astronomer <a href="Edmund%20Halley">Edmund Halley</a> noted this and the problems it would cause for <a href="navigation">navigation</a> in 1701. It was also believed that whatever was causing this effect might be causing changes in the weather, and that studying magnetic variations might lead to better weather prediction.

In 1833 the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> commissioned <a href="Edward%20Sabine%23The%20magnetic%20crusade">a series of magnetic measurements</a> across the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Under the direction of Major <a href="Edward%20Sabine">Edward Sabine</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, a multi-year measuring project began, with the results to be published in 1838. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> wrote to <a href="Prince%20Augustus%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20Sussex">Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex</a>, then President of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that "the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit" and mapping its variations would be "regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking".

In 1837, the British Government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in 1838 their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided. In 1839 the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>; <a href="St.%20Helena">St. Helena</a>; <a href="Hobart%2C%20Tasmania">Hobart, Tasmania</a> and (eventually) <a href="Toronto%2C%20Ontario">Toronto, Ontario</a>. Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on <a href="Saint%20Helen%27s%20Island">Saint Helen's Island</a> off <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead. The team arrived in 1839, and set up camp at <a href="Fort%20York">Fort York</a> in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings. The observatory was given of land to the west of King's College; the <a href="Ontario%20Legislature">Ontario Legislature</a> now occupies the area on which the college was located.

The observatory, officially "Her Majesty's Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at Toronto", was completed the following year. It consisted of two log buildings, one for the magnetic instruments and the other a smaller semi-buried building nearby for "experimental determinations". The north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a <a href="theodolite">theodolite</a> used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time. The buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible; when metal was required, non-magnetic materials such as <a href="brass">brass</a> or <a href="copper">copper</a> were used. A small barracks was built nearby to house the crew.

Using the measurements from the Toronto and Hobart sites, Sabine noticed both short-term fluctuations in magnetic declination over a period of hours, and longer-term variations over months. He quickly concluded that the short term variations were due to the day/night cycle, while the longer term ones were due to the number of visible sunspots. He published two introductory papers on the topic in the "<a href="Philosophical%20Transactions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a>". The first, in 1851, was a collection of early measurements; the second in 1852 correlated with <a href="Heinrich%20Schwabe">Heinrich Schwabe</a>'s sunspot measurements, which had been made widely available in Alexander von Humboldt's "Cosmos", also published in 1851. With further data collected from the Toronto site, Sabine was able to demonstrate conclusively that the eleven-year <a href="sunspot%20cycle">sunspot cycle</a> caused a similarly periodic variation in the Earth's magnetic field. He presented a third and conclusive paper on the topic in 1856, "On Periodical Laws Discoverable in the Mean Effects of the Larger Magnetic Disturbances", in which he singled out the Toronto site for particular praise.
Sir <a href="John%20Henry%20Lefroy">John Henry Lefroy</a>, a pioneer in the study of terrestrial magnetism served as director of the magnetic observatory from 1842 to 1853; In 1960, the Ontario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Citizenship and Culture erected a Provincial Military Plaque in his honour on the University of Toronto campus.

In 1853 the Royal Society's project was concluded, and the observatory was set to be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see <a href="Meteorological%20Service%20of%20Canada">Meteorological Service of Canada</a>) under the direction of the <a href="Fisheries%20and%20Oceans%20Canada">Ministry of Marine and Fisheries</a>. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.

The new building was designed in 1853 by local architect <a href="Frederick%20William%20Cumberland">Frederick Cumberland</a>, who was also working on the design of <a href="University%20College%2C%20University%20of%20Toronto">University College</a>, which was being built just north of the Observatory to replace King's College. The new observatory design called for a stone building, with an attached tower containing the theodolite. The new building was completed in 1855, and stood directly opposite the entrance of today's <a href="Convocation%20Hall">Convocation Hall</a>.

During its time as a meteorological station, the observatory collected reports from 312 observation stations in Canada and another 36 in the United States. Each station was equipped with a "Mercurial Barometer, two Thermometers (a maximum and a minimum Thermometer), an Anemometer to measure the velocity of the wind, a Wind Vane and a Rain Gauge". Reports were sent in coded form to the Observatory at 8 am and 8 pm every day, <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> (then known as "75th meridian time"), and used to produce a chart predicting the weather for the following 36 hours. These predictions were then telegraphed across the country, and charts were distributed to newspapers and the Board of Trade, where they could be viewed by the public. With the installation of telephones, the Observatory also offered weather reports on demand, which was an important service to fruit vendors, who used the reports to plan shipping.

Among its other uses, in 1880, measurements from the site were used as part of the effort to develop <a href="standard%20time">standard time</a>. The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>'s <a href="Dominion%20Observatory">Dominion Observatory</a>. At exactly 11:55 am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical signal from the Observatory.

In 1881 the observatory's director, Charles Carpmeal, suggested adding a high-quality telescope to the observatory. He felt that direct solar observations would lead to a better understanding of sunspot effects on weather (as late as 1910 the observatory's then-director, R. F. Stupart, noted that "sun spots have more to do with our weather conditions than have the rings around the moon."). Coincidentally, the Canadian government (having <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">formed in 1867</a>) was interested in taking part in the major international effort to accurately record the December 1882 <a href="Transit%20of%20Venus">Transit of Venus</a>.

Funds were provided for the purchase of a 6-inch (150 mm) <a href="refracting%20telescope">refracting telescope</a> from <a href="T.%20Cooke%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">T. Cooke & Sons</a>. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable to take part in the transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 <a href="Transit%20of%20Mercury">Transit of Mercury</a> for the same reason.

By the 1890s, the observatory had become crowded by the rapidly growing university. Electrification of the tramways along <a href="College%20Street%20%28Toronto%29">College Street</a> just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in <a href="Agincourt%2C%20Toronto">Agincourt</a>, at that time largely empty fields, (found on later maps on the north end of George Forfar farm east of Midland Avenue near Highway 401 or where Health Canada Protection Branch building resides today) leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.

By 1907, new university buildings completely surrounded the observatory; dust from the construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and move to a new building at the north end of campus at 315 <a href="Bloor%20Street">Bloor Street</a> West, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.

The university assumed ownership of the now-disused observatory building and was originally going to abandon it. <a href="Louis%20Beaufort%20Stewart">Louis Beaufort Stewart</a>, a lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, campaigned for it to be saved for the Department of Surveying and Geodesy. He eventually arranged for the building to be re-constructed on a more suitable site. Demolition work was carried out in 1907: the stones were simply left in place over the winter, and were used the following year to construct a re-arranged building just east of the main University College building (south of <a href="Hart%20House%20%28University%20of%20Toronto%29">Hart House</a>).

In 1930 the Meteorological Office no longer used the Cooke telescope, and agreed to donate it to the university if they would handle its removal. Both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the observatory building. The telescope moved once again in 1952 to the <a href="David%20Dunlap%20Observatory">David Dunlap Observatory</a> north of the city, and in 1984 it was donated to the <a href="Canada%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Museum">Canada Science and Technology Museum</a>. The Department of Surveying and Geodesy used the observatory until the 1950s. Since then the office areas have been used for a variety of purposes, including a police substation and a telephone switchboard. Renamed as the Louis Beaufort Stewart Observatory, the building was handed over to the Students' Administrative Council (now <a href="University%20of%20Toronto%20Students%27%20Union">University of Toronto Students' Union</a>) in 1953, which has used the building since then. The dome, now unused, receives a yearly multi-colour paint job by engineering students.

The property is listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register since 1973. The listing notes it was opened as an observatory in 1857, designed by Cumberland and Storm.

Symphonic poems (Liszt)

The symphonic poems of the Hungarian composer <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> are a series of 13 orchestral works, numbered S.95–107. The first 12 were composed between 1848 and 1858 (though some use material conceived earlier); the last, "Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe" ("From the Cradle to the Grave"), followed in 1882. These works helped establish the genre of orchestral <a href="program%20music">program music</a>—compositions written to illustrate an extra-musical plan derived from a play, poem, painting or work of nature. They inspired the <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a>s of <a href="Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana">Bedřich Smetana</a>, <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Antonín Dvořák</a>, <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> and others.

Liszt's intent, according to musicologist <a href="Hugh%20Macdonald">Hugh MacDonald</a>, was for these single-movement works "to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought." In other words, Liszt wanted these works to display a complexity in their interplay of themes similar to that usually reserved for the opening <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movement</a> of the Classical <a href="symphony">symphony</a>; this principal self-contained section was normally considered the most important in the larger whole of the symphony in terms of academic achievement and musical architecture. At the same time, Liszt wanted to incorporate the abilities of program music to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods. To capture these dramatic and evocative qualities while achieving the scale of an opening movement, he combined elements of <a href="overture">overture</a> and symphony in a modified sonata design. The composition of the symphonic poems proved daunting. They underwent a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a balance of musical form.

Aware that the public appreciated instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority <a href="Humphrey%20Searle">Humphrey Searle</a> suggests that he may have been closer to his contemporary <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.

According to cultural historian Hannu Salmi, classical music began to gain public prominence in Western Europe in the latter 18th century through the establishment of concerts by musical societies in cities such as <a href="Leipzig%2C%20Germany">Leipzig</a> and the subsequent press coverage of these events. This was a consequence of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, according to music critic and historian <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a>, which brought changes to the early 19th-century lifestyles of the working masses. The lower and middle classes began to take an interest in the arts, which previously had been enjoyed mostly by the clergy and aristocracy. In the 1830s, concert halls were few, and orchestras served mainly in the production of operas—symphonic works were considered far lower in importance. However, the European music scene underwent a transformation in the 1840s. As the role of religion diminished, Salmi asserts, 19th-century culture remained a religious one and the attendance of the arts in historical or similarly impressive surroundings "may still have generated a rapture akin to experiencing the sacred." Schonberg, cultural historian Peter Cay and musicologist <a href="Alan%20Walker%20%28musicologist%29">Alan Walker</a> add that, while aristocrats still held private musical events, public concerts grew as institutions for the middle class, which was growing prosperous and could now afford to attend. As interest burgeoned, these concerts were performed at a rapidly increasing number of venues. Programs often ran over three hours, "even if the content was thin: two or more symphonies, two overtures, vocal and instrumental numbers, duets, a concerto." Roughly half of the presented music was vocal in nature. Symphonies by <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> or <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> usually opened or concluded concerts, and "while these works were revered as models of great music, they were ultimately less popular than the arias and scenes from operas and oratorios that stood prominently in the middle of these concerts."

Meanwhile, the future of the symphony genre was coming into doubt. Musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, "Even symphonies by [such] well-known composers of the early 19th century as <a href="%C3%89tienne%20M%C3%A9hul">Méhul</a>, <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Cherubini</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20H%C3%A9rold">Hérold</a>, <a href="Carl%20Czerny">Czerny</a>, <a href="Muzio%20Clementi">Clementi</a>, <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Weber</a> and <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Moscheles</a> were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three." While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, "there was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism."

The crux of the issue, Bonds asserts, "was never really one of style ... but rather of generic conception." Between his <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Third</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Seventh</a> Symphonies, Beethoven had pushed the symphony well beyond the boundaries of entertainment into those of moral, political and philosophical statement. By adding text and voices in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth</a> Symphony, he not only redefined the genre but also called into question whether instrumental music could truly be superior to vocal music. The Ninth, Bonds says, in fact became the catalyst that fueled debate about the symphony genre. <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> was the only composer "able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy." However, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a> and <a href="Niels%20Gade">Niels Gade</a> also achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead. Regardless, composers increasingly turned to the "more compact form" of the <a href="overture%23Concert%20overture">concert overture</a> "as a vehicle within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas"; examples included Mendelssohn's overtures "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28Mendelssohn%29%23Overture">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" (1826) and "<a href="The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29">The Hebrides</a>" (1830).

<a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, a Hungarian composer, had attempted to write a "Revolutionary Symphony" as early as 1830; however, his focus for the early part of his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist. "Lisztomania" swept across Europe, the emotional charge of his recitals making them "more like séances than serious musical events", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical. Musicologist <a href="Alan%20Walker%20%28musicologist%29">Alan Walker</a> says, "Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy." The demands of concert life "reached exponential proportions" and "every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others." Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked the time to do so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform. He settled in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, where he had been made its honorary <a href="Kapellmeister">music director</a> in 1842, to work on his compositions.

Weimar was a small town that held many attractions for Liszt. Two of Germany's greatest men of letters, <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, had both lived there. As one of the cultural centers of Germany, Weimar boasted a theater and an orchestra plus its own painters, poets and scientists. The <a href="University%20of%20Jena">University of Jena</a> was also nearby. Most importantly, the town's patroness was the <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Maria%20Pavlovna%20of%20Russia%20%281786%E2%80%931859%29">Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna</a>, the sister of <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I of Russia</a>. "This triple alliance of court, theater and academia was difficult to resist." The town also received its first railway line in 1848, which gave Liszt relatively quick access from there to the rest of Germany.

Liszt desired to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture form. As he himself said, "New wine demands new bottles," and as Alan Walker points out, the "language of music was changing; it seemed pointless to Liszt to contain it in forms that were almost 100 years old." The music of overtures is to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods; Liszt intended to combine those programmatic qualities with a scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movement of Classical symphonies. The opening movement, with its interplay of contrasting themes under <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>, was normally considered the most important part of the symphony. To achieve his objectives, he needed a more flexible method of developing musical themes than sonata form would allow, but one that would preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. 

Liszt found his method through two compositional practices, which he used in his <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a>s. The first practice was <a href="cyclic%20form">cyclic form</a>, a procedure established by Beethoven in which certain movements are not only linked but actually reflect one another's content. Liszt took Beethoven's practice one step further, combining separate movements into a single-movement cyclic structure. Many of Liszt's mature works follow this pattern, of which "<a href="Les%20pr%C3%A9ludes">Les préludes</a>" is one of the best-known examples. The second practice was <a href="thematic%20transformation">thematic transformation</a>, a type of variation in which one theme is changed, not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new, separate and independent. Thematic transformation, like cyclic form, was nothing new in itself; it had already been used by Mozart and Haydn. In the final movement of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a>, Beethoven had transformed the theme of the "Ode to Joy" into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes, and Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his "<a href="Wanderer%20Fantasy">Wanderer Fantasy</a>", a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation, not only in the symphonic poems but in other works such as his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Liszt%29">Second Piano Concerto</a> and his <a href="Sonata%20in%20B%20minor%20%28Liszt%29">Piano Sonata in B minor</a>. In fact, when a work had to be shortened, Liszt tended to cut sections of conventional musical development and preserve sections of thematic transformation.

Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French composer <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a> wrote an orchestral piece based on <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s poem "Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne". The work exhibits characteristics of a symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as <a href="Norman%20Demuth">Norman Demuth</a> and <a href="Julien%20Tiersot">Julien Tiersot</a>, consider it the first of its genre, preceding Liszt's compositions. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.

Until he coined the term "symphonic poem", Liszt introduced several of these new orchestral works as overtures; in fact, some of the poems were initially overtures or preludes for other works, only later being expanded or rewritten past the confines of the overture form. The first version of "<a href="Tasso%2C%20Lamento%20e%20Trionfo%20%28Liszt%29">Tasso</a>", Liszt stated, was an incidental overture for <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>'s 1790 drama "<a href="Torquato%20Tasso%20%28play%29">Torquato Tasso</a>", performed for the Weimar Goethe Centenary Festival. "<a href="Orpheus%20%28Liszt%29">Orpheus</a>" was first performed in Weimar on February 16, 1854 as a prelude to <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Christoph Willibald Gluck</a>'s <a href="opera">opera</a> "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>". Likewise, "<a href="Hamlet%20%28Liszt%29">Hamlet</a>" started out in 1858 as a prelude to the <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> tragedy. Liszt first used the term "Sinfonische Dichtung" (symphonic poem) in public at a concert in Weimar on April 19, 1854 to describe "Tasso". Five days later, he used the term "poèmes symphoniques" in a letter to <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a> to describe "Les preludes" and "Orpheus".

Particularly striking in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a>. As purely musical structures, they do not follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which <a href="leitmotif">motifs</a>—recurring melodies associated with a subject—are thematically transformed in a manner similar to that later made famous by <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. <a href="Recapitulation%20%28music%29">Recapitulation</a>s, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">codas</a>, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can <a href="musical%20development">affect the listener's concept of the themes</a>. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.

Part of this creative experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions with varying sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, on a small number of staves with some indication of the orchestration. After an assistant—<a href="August%20Conradi">August Conradi</a> from 1848 to 1849, <a href="Joachim%20Raff">Joachim Raff</a> from 1850 to 1853—had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: "I needed to hear them in order to get an idea of them." He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained "works in progress" as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.

"Tasso", based on the life of sixteenth-century Italian <a href="poet">poet</a>, <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>, is a perfect example of both Liszt's working method and his achievements based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section ("Lament") and a fast one ("Triumph"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variation</a>s on a single melody—a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a <a href="minuet">minuet</a>. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the <a href="House%20of%20Este">Este</a> family in <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a>. In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra "assumes a dual role" in this section; strings play a self-contained piece based on the original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer <a href="Pietro%20Raimondi">Pietro Raimondi</a>, whose <a href="counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> mastery was such that he had written three oratorios—"Joseph", "Potiphar" and "Jacob"—which could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a musical bridge between the opening lament and final triumphal sections, it along with other modifications "rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer". The piece became "far too long and developed" to be considered an overture and was redesignated a symphonic poem.

When Liszt started writing symphonic poems, "he had very little experience in handling an orchestra ... his knowledge of the technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly anything for the orchestra." For these reasons he relied first on his assistants <a href="August%20Conradi">August Conradi</a> and <a href="Joachim%20Raff">Joachim Raff</a> to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his "orchestral voice". Raff, "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a> and violinist Edmund Singer. "[Liszt] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" Both Singer and cellist <a href="Bernhard%20Cossmann">Bernhard Cossmann</a> were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produce—knowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a "piano-organ" from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of <a href="piano">piano</a> and <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a>, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.

While Raff was able to offer "practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt", there may have been "a basic misunderstanding" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them." Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of "Prometheus", he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, "Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me."

Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by "Die Musik" in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow "that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that "the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Liszt%29">E-flat-major Piano Concerto</a> was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff." Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar <a href="Peter%20Raabe">Peter Raabe</a> carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.

Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. His doing so, Alan Walker states, "was a reflection of the historical position in which he found himself." Liszt was aware these musical works would be experienced not just by select connoisseurs, as might have been the case in previous generations, but also by the general public. In addition, he knew about the public's fondness for attaching stories to instrumental music, regardless of their source, their relevance to a musical composition or whether the composer had actually sanctioned them. Therefore, in a pre-emptive gesture, Liszt provided context before others could invent one to take its place. Liszt may have also felt that since many of these works were written in new forms, some sort of verbal or written explanation would be welcome to explain their shape.

These prefaces have proven atypical in a couple of ways. For one, they do not spell out a specific, step-by-step scenario that the music would follow but rather a general context. Some of them, in fact, are little more than autobiographical asides on what inspired Liszt to compose a piece or what feelings he was trying to inspire through it. While these insights could prove "both useful and interesting" in themselves, Walker admits, will they aid listeners to "pictorialize the music that follows?" For Liszt, Walker concludes, the "pictorialization of a detailed program is simply not an issue." Moreover, Liszt wrote these prefaces long after he had composed the music. This was the complete opposite of other composers, who wrote their music to fit a pre-existing program. For both these reasons, Walker suggests, Liszt's prefaces could be called "programmes about music" with equal logic or validity. He adds that the prefaces might not have entirely been of Liszt's idea or doing, since evidence exists that his then-companion <a href="Carolyne%20zu%20Sayn-Wittgenstein">Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein</a> helped shape or create them.

Overall, Walker concludes, "Posterity may have overestimated the importance of extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. We would not want to be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made about the origins of his music; but we should not follow them slavishly, for the simple reason that the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" as being evocative rather than representational. "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.

Liszt composed his symphonic poems during a period of great debate among musicians in central Europe and Germany, known as the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Romantics">War of the Romantics</a>. While Beethoven's work was admired universally, conservatives that included <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a> and members of the <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn%20College%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre">Leipzig Conservatory</a> considered it unsurpassable. Liberals such as Liszt, Wagner and others of the <a href="New%20German%20School">New German School</a> saw Beethoven's innovations as a beginning in music, not an end. In this climate, Liszt had emerged as a lightning-rod for the avant-garde. Even with the innovative music being written by Wagner and Berlioz, it was Liszt, Walker says, "who was making all the noise and attracting the most attention" through his musical compositions, polemic writings, conducting and teaching.

Aware of the potential for controversy, Liszt wrote, "The <a href="barometer">barometer</a> is hardly set on praise for me at the moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic <a href="Eduard%20Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a> found even the term "Sinfonische Dichtung" contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, "<a href="Les%20pr%C3%A9ludes%20%28Liszt%29">Les préludes</a>". Surgeon <a href="Theodor%20Billroth">Theodor Billroth</a>, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, "This morning [Brahms] and Kirchner played the "Symphonic Poems" (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called music—toilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [piano arrangement of the] G Major String Sextet." Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his "Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems". Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics:

It is filled with penetrating observations about the true nature of "<a href="program%20music">programme music</a>", about the mysterious relationship between "form" and "content" and about the historical links that bind the symphonic poem to the classical symphony... The symphonic poems, Wagner assured his readers, were first and foremost music. Their importance for history ... lay in the fact that Liszt had discovered a way of creating his material from the potential essence of the other arts... Wagner's central observations are so accurate ... that we can only assume that there had been a number of discussions between [Liszt and Wagner] as to what exactly a "symphonic poem" really was.

Such was the controversy over these works that two points were overlooked by the critics. First, Liszt's own attitude toward program music was derived from Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Beethoven%29">"Pastoral" Symphony</a>, and he would have likely argued that his music, like the "Pastoral", was "more the expression of feeling than painting." Second, more conservative composers such as <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> and Brahms had also written program music. Mendelssohn's <a href="The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29">"The Hebrides" Overture</a> could be considered a musical seascape based on autobiographical experience but indistinguishable in musical intent from Liszt's symphonic poems. By titling the first of his Op. 10 Ballades as "Edward", Brahms nominated it as the musical counterpart of its old Scottish saga and namesake. This was not the only time Brahms would write program music.
Liszt's new works did not find guaranteed success in their audiences, especially in cities where listeners were accustomed to more conservative music programming. While Liszt had "a solid success" with "Prometheus" and "Orpheus" in 1855 when he conducted in Brunswick, the climate for "Les Préludes" and "Tasso" that December in Berlin was cooler. His performance of "Mazeppa" two years later in Leipzig was almost stopped due to hissing from the audience. A similar incident occurred when <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a> conducted "Die Ideale" in Berlin in 1859; after the performance, the conductor turned on the audience and ordered the demonstrators to leave, "as it is not customary to hiss in this hall." Matters improved somewhat in the following decades, thanks to the efforts of Liszt disciples such as Bülow, <a href="Carl%20Tausig">Carl Tausig</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Damrosch">Leopold Damrosch</a> and <a href="Karl%20Klindworth">Karl Klindworth</a>. Nevertheless, audiences at the time found the compositions puzzling.

The audiences may have been challenged by the works' complexity, which have also caused problems for musicians. Written in new forms, the symphonic poems used unorthodox time signatures, producing an unusual <a href="beat%20%28music%29">beat</a> at times. The irregular rhythm proved difficult to play and sounded erratic to listeners. Compared to the mellower <a href="harmony">harmonies</a> of Mozart's or Haydn's symphonies, or many operatic arias of the time, the symphonic poem's advanced harmonies could produce harsh or awkward music. Due to its use of unusual <a href="key%20signature">key signature</a>s, the symphonic poem had many sharp and flat notes, more than a standard musical work. The greater number of notes posed a challenge to musicians, who have to <a href="transposition%20%28music%29">vary the pitch</a> of the notes in accordance with the score. The quick fluctuations in the speed of the music were another factor in the symphonic poem's complexity. The constant use of chamber-music textures, which are produced by having single players perform extended solo passages or having small groups play ensemble passages, put a stress on the orchestra; the mistakes of the solo artist or small groups would not be "covered up" by the mass sound of the orchestra and were obvious to everyone.

These aspects of the symphonic poem demanded players to have superior caliber, perfect intonation, keen ears and knowledge of the roles of their orchestra members. The complexity of the symphonic poems may have been one reason that Liszt urged other conductors to "hold aloof" from the works until they were prepared to deal with the challenges. Most orchestras of small towns at that time were not capable of meeting the demands of this music. Contemporary orchestras also faced another challenge when playing Liszt's symphonic poems for the first time. Liszt kept his works on manuscripts, distributing them to the orchestra on his tour. Some parts of the manuscripts were so heavily corrected that players found it difficult to decipher them, let alone play them well. The symphonic poems were considered such a financial risk that orchestral parts for many of them were not published until the 1880s.

With the exception of "Les préludes", none of the symphonic poems have entered the standard repertoire, though critics suggest that the best of them—"<a href="Prometheus%20%28Liszt%29">Prometheus</a>", "Hamlet" and "<a href="Orpheus%20%28Liszt%29">Orpheus</a>"—are worth further listening. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes, "Unequal in scope and achievement though they are, they looked forward at times to more modern developments and sowed the seeds of a rich crop of music in the two succeeding generations." Speaking of the genre itself, MacDonald adds that, although the symphonic poem is related to opera in its aesthetics, it effectively supplanted opera and sung music by becoming "the most sophisticated development of programme music in the history of the genre." Liszt authority <a href="Humphrey%20Searle">Humphrey Searle</a> essentially concurs with MacDonald, writing that Liszt "wished to expound philosophical and humanistic ideas which were of the greatest importance to him." These ideas were not only connected with Liszt's personal problems as an artist, but they also coincided with explicit problems being addressed by writers and painters of the era.

In developing the symphonic poem, Liszt "satisfied three of the principal aspirations of 19th century music: to relate music to the world outside, to integrate multi-movement forms ... and to elevate instrumental programme music to a level higher than that of opera, the genre previously regarded as the highest mode of musical expression." In fulfilling these needs, the symphonic poems played a major role, widening the scope and expressive power of the advanced music of its time. According to music historian <a href="Alan%20Walker%20%28musicologist%29">Alan Walker</a>, "Their historical importance is undeniable; both <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> and <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> were influenced by them, and adapted and developed the genre in their own way. For all their faults, these pieces offer many examples of the pioneering spirit for which Liszt is celebrated."

In chronological order the symphonic poems are as follows, though the published numbering differs as shown:


Liszt's "<a href="Faust%20Symphony">Faust</a>" and "<a href="Dante%20Symphony">Dante</a>" symphonies share the same aesthetic stance as the symphonic poems; though they are multi-movement works that employ a chorus, their compositional methods and aims are alike. "Two Episodes from Lenau's Faust" should also be considered with the symphonic poems. The first, "Der nächtliche Zug", is closely descriptive of Faust as he watches a passing procession of pilgrims by night. The second, "Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke", which is also known as the First Mephisto Waltz, tells of <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a> seizing a <a href="violin">violin</a> at a village dance.

Tommy Phillips

Thomas Neil Phillips (May 22, 1883 – November 30, 1923) was a Canadian professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">left winger</a>. Like other players of his era, Phillips played for several different teams and leagues. Most notable for his time with the <a href="Kenora%20Thistles">Kenora Thistles</a>, Phillips also played with the <a href="Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Hockey Club</a>, the <a href="Ottawa%20Hockey%20Club">Ottawa Hockey Club</a>, the <a href="Toronto%20Marlboros">Toronto Marlboros</a> and the <a href="Vancouver%20Millionaires">Vancouver Millionaires</a>. Over the course of his career Phillips participated in six <a href="List%20of%20Stanley%20Cup%20challenge%20games">challenges</a> for the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>, the championship trophy of hockey, winning twice: with the Montreal Hockey Club in <a href="1903%20CAHL%20season%23Stanley%20Cup%20Challenges">1903</a> and with the Kenora Thistles, which he <a href="Captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captained</a>, in <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season%23Stanley%20Cup%20challenges">January 1907</a>. Following his playing career, Phillips worked in the <a href="lumber%20industry">lumber industry</a> until his death in 1923.

One of the best defensive forwards of his era, Phillips was also known for his all-around skill, particularly his strong shot and endurance, and was considered, alongside <a href="Frank%20McGee%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Frank McGee</a>, one of the two best players in all of hockey. His younger brother, <a href="Russell%20Phillips%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Russell</a>, also played for the Thistles and was a member of the team when they won the Stanley Cup. When the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was founded in 1945, Phillips was one of the original nine inductees.

Phillips was born in born in <a href="Kenora">Rat Portage</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, on May 22, 1883, the youngest of three children, to James and Marcelline Phillips. James Phillips, who was born in <a href="Fifeshire">Fifeshire</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, on October 14, 1822, had trained as a stonemason and immigrated to Canada to help build railways. He had a son and two daughters from a previous marriage. On April 30, 1877 he married Marcelline (née Bourassa), a native of <a href="Buckingham%2C%20Quebec">Buckingham, Quebec</a>. Their first child, a son named Robert, was born in 1878, followed by a daughter, Margaret, in 1879; both were born in Ottawa. In 1882 James accepted a job in Western Ontario as superintendent of construction for the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> transcontinental rail line, and the family moved to Rat Portage, near the Ontario border with <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. Here a fourth child, <a href="Russell%20Phillips%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Russell</a>, was born in 1888. Russell would also play hockey, winning the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> with Phillips in 1907.

As a young child Phillips learned to play hockey, and by 1895 he had joined the <a href="Rat%20Portage%20Thistles">Rat Portage Thistles</a> junior club, a team of players mostly aged 12 to 16. Phillips helped the team win the 1895–96 intermediate level championship of the Manitoba and Northwest Hockey Association. By 1899–00 Phillips had joined the senior Thistles team, and would be named <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> the following season, when they won the senior league championship. Phillips immediately earned praise for his endurance: in an era when players played the entire match and would often coast to conserve energy, Phillips could play at a fast pace the entire game, with a posthumous newspaper report stating that he "could play for an entire 60 [minutes] at full speed and be as fresh at the end as he was at the start." His skill was already evident at the time, with the "<a href="Kenora%20Daily%20Miner%20and%20News">Rat Portage Miner</a>" praising him as one "of the best <a href="defenceman%20%28ice%20hockey%29">cover-points</a> in the west, being a swift shot, a high lifter and a heavy check." A <a href="forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward</a> when he joined the senior Thistles, Phillips played cover-point for the 1900–01 season, before moving to <a href="winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">left wing</a> in 1901–02; he largely remained in that position for the rest of his career.

Regarded as one of the best players in Northwestern Ontario, Phillips moved east to Montreal in September 1902 to study electrical engineering at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>. He joined the university's hockey team, which had just moved to a new Canadian university league, and was immediately named captain. Phillips only played one match for McGill, on January 23, 1903, against <a href="Queen%27s%20Golden%20Gaels">Queen's University</a>; McGill lost 7–0. Days after the game the <a href="Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Hockey Club</a> asked Phillips to join them for their Stanley Cup <a href="1903%20CAHL%20season%23Stanley%20Cup%20Challenges">challenge series</a> against the <a href="Winnipeg%20Victorias">Winnipeg Victorias</a>. This required the approval of the other university clubs, which agreed on the condition that Phillips end his McGill career, which he did. Montreal won the series; Phillips finished third on the team in scoring with six goals in four games. Phillips also earned praise for his defensive play, particularly his ability to stop <a href="Tony%20Gingras">Tony Gingras</a>, one of the top players on the Victorias.

Later in 1902 Phillips moved to Toronto to attend the Central Business School. He joined the <a href="Toronto%20Marlboros">Toronto Marlboros</a> and, after changing positions to <a href="rover%20%28ice%20hockey%29">rover</a>, was regarded as the team's best player. The Marlboros won both the Toronto city and the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20Association">Ontario Hockey Association</a> senior championships, and felt confident enough with Phillips on the roster to challenge the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Hockey Club</a> for the Stanley Cup. The Marlboros lost the series; Phillips had the most <a href="assist%20%28ice%20hockey%29">assists</a>, though also the most <a href="penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalty minutes</a> of any player in the series, with eight and fifteen, respectively. He was also regarded by Ottawa reporters to be by far the best player on the Marlboros, with one saying he was "much too fast a man for the company in which he is travelling."

Phillips moved back to Rat Portage in 1904 when he learned his father was dying. Offered a job with a lumber company, and a <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>1,000 bonus to play hockey for the Thistles, he stayed in the city, much to the disappointment of the Marlboros, who had wanted him to stay in Toronto. Rat Portage was amalgamated with neighbouring towns in 1905 and was renamed Kenora. Due to their proximity to Manitoba, the Thistles played in the <a href="Manitoba%20Hockey%20Association">Manitoba Hockey League</a>. In the 1904–05 season Phillips had the second-most goals on the team and in the league, with twenty-six, two fewer than <a href="Billy%20McGimsie">Billy McGimsie</a>. The Thistles won the Manitoba league championship, allowing them to <a href="List%20of%20Stanley%20Cup%20challenge%20games">challenge for the Stanley</a>, held at the time by the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Senators</a>. By this time Phillips was regarded as one of the best players in Canada, equal to <a href="Frank%20McGee%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Frank McGee</a> of the Senators. The "<a href="Montreal%20Herald">Montreal Herald</a>" reported that "nine out of ten people will reply that either Frank McGee or Tom Phillips is" the best player in the country. In the first game of the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20FAHL%20season%23Ottawa%20vs.%20Rat%20Portage">challenge series</a> against Ottawa, Phillips scored the first two goals, then added another three in the second half of the game as the Thistles won by a score of 9–3. Ottawa won the second game, 4–2, while Phillips was held pointless. In the third and deciding game of the series, Phillips scored a <a href="Hat-trick%23Hockey">hat trick</a>, including the first of the game, although Ottawa won the game 5–4 to retain the Cup.

The Thistles won the Stirling Cup as champions of western Canada in the 1905–06 season, which allowed them the right to challenge for the Cup again, since won by the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>. There was an early spring that year, and with natural ice used at the time, the series had to wait until the following winter. In the 1906–07 season, Phillips led the league in goals, with eighteen. In the first game of the Thistles' successful two-game, total-goal <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season%23Wanderers%20vs.%20Kenora%20at%20Montreal">Stanley Cup challenge</a> against the Wanderers in January 1907, Phillips scored all four goals in the Thistles' 4–2 victory; he followed that up with three goals in the second game, an 8–6 victory, giving the Thistles a 12–6 win. A <a href="1907%20ECAHA%20season%23Wanderers%20vs.%20Kenora%20at%20Winnipeg">two-game rematch</a> two months later saw the team lose; Phillips' nine goals, and sixteen penalty minutes led both categories.
Prior to the start of the 1907–08 season, he was offered between $1,500 and $1,800 to play for the Wanderers, but instead signed with the Ottawa Senators for a salary of $1,500. Phillips explained that he was ready to sign with the Wanderers, but the contract he received did not include everything promised. In signing with Ottawa, Philips rejoined <a href="Harry%20Westwick">Harry Westwick</a> and <a href="Alf%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Alf Smith</a>, who had both joined the Thistles for their Stanley Cup defence in March 1907. It also likely made him the highest paid hockey player in Canada. He finished the season with twenty-six goals, two behind the scoring leaders, his teammate <a href="Marty%20Walsh%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Marty Walsh</a> and <a href="Russell%20Bowie">Russell Bowie</a> of the <a href="Montreal%20Victorias">Victorias</a>.

Though offered a high salary to stay in Ottawa, Phillips decided to leave the team, and prior to the 1909 hockey season joined the <a href="Edmonton%20Hockey%20Club">Edmonton Hockey Club</a> of the <a href="Alberta%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Alberta Amateur Hockey Association</a> (AAHA). The Edmonton team had signed several high-profile players from Eastern Canada to play for the team in the Cup challenge; only two players on the team were from Edmonton, with the rest coming from the east. Phillips and <a href="Lester%20Patrick">Lester Patrick</a>, another player from the east, never even reached Edmonton; they met their team in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> on its way east for the Cup challenge. Phillips, who was paid $600 for the two-game series, played in the first game against the Montreal Wanderers, which Edmonton lost 7–3, but broke his ankle and was forced to miss the second game, a 7–6 Edmonton win.

Over the summer Phillips was invited by Patrick to move to <a href="Nelson%2C%20British%20Columbia">Nelson, British Columbia</a>, where the latter was putting together a club of star players to challenge for the Cup. He played in 1909–10 with the local team, retiring after the season and taking a position as a manager of a lumber company in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. When Patrick and his brother <a href="Frank%20Patrick%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Frank</a> formed the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20Association">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> (PCHA) in 1911, Phillips was convinced to come out of retirement and join one of the teams in the new league, the <a href="Vancouver%20Millionaires">Vancouver Millionaires</a>. Phillips finished the <a href="1912%20PCHA%20season">1912 season</a> fourth on Vancouver in goals, and seventh overall in the league, with seventeen in fourteen games. Phillips, who realized that his skills had diminished, retired for a second time at the end of the season. A close friend of the Patricks, he remained close to the league, and occasionally <a href="official%20%28ice%20hockey%29">officiated</a> matches after his retirement.

After retiring from hockey Phillps ran his own lumber company and later moved to Toronto in 1920. After having a tooth pulled in 1923, he died of blood poisoning at the age of 40. When the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was founded in 1945, Phillips was inducted as one of the first nine inductees. He was also inducted into the <a href="Northwestern%20Ontario%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1987.

The were two <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s ordered as part of the "<a href="Eight-eight%20fleet">Eight-Eight</a>" fleet for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) during the early 1920s. The ships were larger versions of the preceding , and carried an additional twin-gun <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a>. The design for the class served as a basis for the s.

Both ships were launched in late 1921, but the first ship, , was cancelled in accordance with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> before it could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> in the <a href="Bungo%20Channel">Bungo Channel</a>. The hull of the second ship, , was converted into an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> of the same name. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> of the late 1930s, and took part in the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941 and the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">combined carrier airstrike</a> on <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Australia, during the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">Dutch East Indies campaign</a>. She was sunk during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in 1942.

The IJN believed that a modern battle fleet of eight battleships and eight <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s was necessary for the defense of Japan; the government ratified that idea in 1907. This policy was the genesis of the <a href="Eight-Eight%20Fleet%20Program">Eight-Eight Fleet Program</a>, the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s less than eight years old. Advances in naval technology represented by the British battleship and the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> forced the IJN to reevaluate on several occasions which ships it considered "modern" and, in 1911, it restarted the program with orders for the dreadnoughts and the s. By 1915, the IJN was halfway to its goal and wanted to order four more dreadnoughts, but the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet</a> rejected the plan and authorized only the dreadnought and two battlecruisers in the 1916 budget. Later that year American President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> announced plans for ten additional battleships and six battlecruisers, and the Diet authorized three more dreadnoughts in response the following year: a second ——and two to a modified design, "Tosa" and "Kaga".

The IJN began reevaluating the "Nagato" design in light of lessons learned from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916, experiments evaluating armor protection, and newly acquired information on the protective schemes of British and American capital ships. These lessons highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against <a href="plunging%20fire">plunging fire</a>. Existing methods of defense against <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> <a href="Yuzuru%20Hiraga">Yuzuru Hiraga</a>, superintendent of shipbuilding and the <a href="naval%20architect">naval architect</a> in charge of the fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the "Nagato" design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, "Mutsu", on 12 June 1917, well before she was actually <a href="Keel">laid down</a>.

Hiraga's design for the ship reflected the latest combat experience as well as incorporating advances in <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a> technology. It added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by the reduction of the number of boilers from 21 to 12 while the power remained the same. He reduced the <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> from 20 guns to 16; they were moved up a deck to improve their arcs of fire and their ability to shoot during heavy weather. To increase the ship's protection he proposed to angle the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and to thicken the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s to improve the ship's underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as "Nagato", although it would cost about a million <a href="yen">yen</a> more. These changes would have considerably delayed the ship's completion and were rejected by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Navy%20of%20Japan">Navy Ministry</a>. The rejected design formed the basis for a much larger battleship, designated as A-127, with nearly twice as much armor weight as the "Nagato"s. It was designed to achieve the same speed as the older ships, to allow them to maneuver together as a tactical formation. This design was accepted on 27 March 1918 and became the "Tosa" class.

The "Tosa"-class ships had a planned displacement of , and at a full load. They would have been long at the <a href="Length%20at%20the%20waterline">waterline</a>, and <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a>; the ships would have had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . The "Tosa" class would have had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at normal load. A <a href="turbo-electric">turbo-electric</a> propulsion system was considered for these ships after the United States announced that the system was a great success in the battleship , and the Japanese estimated that a turbo-electric plant could be installed in the "Tosa" class, which would have given the ships a speed of , a range at full speed, and a range at , but this system was rejected. More conventional Curtis geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s were chosen, powered by 12 <a href="Kampon">Kampon</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, eight of which would have used <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and four of which would have used a mixture of oil and coal. This system would have provided to four propeller shafts for a top speed of . The fuel stores would have amounted to of oil and of coal; at a speed of 14 knots, this would have enabled a maximum range of .

The "Tosa"-class ships were intended to be armed with a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of ten 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="41%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">41-centimeter</a> guns in five twin <a href="Gun%20turret">turrets</a>, four of which were <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.

The guns used Type 91 <a href="Armour-piercing%20capped%23Armor-piercing">armor-piercing, capped shells</a>. Each of these shells weighed and had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . Also available was a <a href="Armour-piercing%20capped%23High-explosive">high-explosive shell</a> that had a muzzle velocity of .

The ships' secondary armament of twenty 50-caliber <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">3rd Year Type 14-centimeter guns</a> would have been mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s, 12 on the upper sides of the hull and eight in the superstructure. The 3rd Year Type guns had a maximum range of at an elevation of +35 degrees. Each gun could fire a high-explosive projectile at a rate up to 10 rounds per minute and was provided with 120 rounds. <a href="Anti-aircraft%20defense">Anti-aircraft defense</a> was provided by four 40-caliber <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">3rd Year Type 8-centimeter</a> <a href="AA%20gun">AA gun</a>s in single mounts. The high-angle guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. They fired a projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of . The guns were normally supplied with 250 rounds each, although space was available for a total of 400 rounds per gun. These 3rd Year Type guns were intended to be replaced by four 45-caliber anti-aircraft guns.

The "Tosa"s were intended to mount eight <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four above water and four below. The former were to be provided with two torpedoes each and the latter with three each.

The ships' armor protection was designed to break up shells from a distance of and the primary armor plates were backed up by splinter <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a> intended to contain any shell fragments. They would have been protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">main belt</a> of <a href="Vickers%20cemented%20armor">Vickers cemented armor</a> that sloped outwards 15 degrees at the top. <a href="Amidships">Amidships</a> it would have been thick and thick fore and aft. Approximately of the armor belt was below the waterline. The side armor was closed off at its ends by bulkheads thick. The main battery turrets and the portions of the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s above the main <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> would have had between of armor plating, and the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> walls would have had armor thick and a roof of armor plates. The communications tube below the conning tower would have had walls thick.

The middle deck was the primary armored deck and was connected to the top of the armor belt. It would have consisted of a plate of New Vickers non-cemented armor on top of a plate of high-tensile steel (HTS) above the engine and boiler rooms. Above the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s, the thickness of the HTS plate would have increased to 63 mm. The lower deck would have consisted of two plates of HTS. For the first time in a Japanese ship, the "Tosa"s would have had the lower portion of the single <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> protected by 229 mm of armor. In addition, the funnel openings in the lower deck would have been protected by armor gratings.

The ships would have had an internal <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a> to provide protection against underwater explosions. This was backed by a <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a> also made up of three layers of HTS and angled outwards to meet the base of the waterline belt. It connected to a splinter bulkhead on the lower deck behind the waterline belt. Behind the torpedo bulge and the splinter bulkhead was another splinter bulkhead 12.7–19 mm thick.

Construction of both ships began in 1920, but the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> intervened, mandating the cancellation of all capital ships being built. Work stopped on the two "Tosa"-class battleships on 5 February 1922. After being stricken on 1 April 1924, "Tosa"s incomplete <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> was used to test her armor scheme against long-range naval gunfire, aerial bombs, <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>, and torpedoes. Two of the shells fired at her fell short, but deeply penetrated her hull through the thin armor of the torpedo bulge below the waterline armor belt. This sparked an interest in optimizing underwater performance of Japanese shells that culminated in production of the Type 91 armor-piercing shell. Conversely, the IJN took measures to defend against shells of this type when reconstructing its existing battleships during the 1930s, as well as in the designs of the s and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s of the <a href="Mogami-class%20cruiser">"Mogami"</a> and es. "Tosa"s torpedo defense system proved able to defeat torpedo <a href="warhead">warhead</a>s, but not larger ones. After the conclusion of the tests, the ship was scuttled by opening her <a href="Kingston%20valve">Kingston valve</a>s on 9 February 1925 in of water in the <a href="Bungo%20Channel">Bungo Channel</a> after the demolition charges failed to detonate.

The battlecruiser , which was being converted to an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> under the terms of the treaty, was wrecked in the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> in 1923 and rendered unusable. As a result, "Kaga", which was originally slated to be <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> under the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> (), was converted in "Amagi"s stead. No work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20Arsenal">Yokosuka Naval Arsenal</a> was repaired. Although the ship was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 31 March 1928, she did not join the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> ("Rengō Kantai") until 30 November 1929.
Much like the converted , "Kaga" was fitted with two flying-off decks "stepped down" from a <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> that extended two-thirds of the ship; in theory, this allowed planes to take off directly from the hangars while other planes landed on the top. As aircraft became heavier during the 1930s, they required longer distances to get airborne and the lower flight decks became useless. "Kaga"s 1935 reconstruction removed the lower two decks and extended the top flight deck to the bow. As completed, the ship had two main <a href="hangar">hangar</a> decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft.

"Kaga" was provided with a heavy gun armament in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized. The ship was armed with ten <a href="20%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">20 cm/50 3rd Year Type guns</a>: one twin-gun turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in casemates aft. "Kaga"s waterline armored belt was reduced from during her reconstruction and her deck armor was also reduced from . The carrier displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battleship. This reduction in her displacement increased her speed to and gave her a range of at .
In 1933–35 "Kaga" was rebuilt to increase her top speed, improve her exhaust systems, and adapt her flight decks to more modern, heavier aircraft. After the reconstruction, the ship displaced at standard load, better boilers gave her a top speed of , and additional fuel storage increased her range to at and raised her aircraft capacity to 90. The ten guns, although now all mounted singly in casemates, were retained.

"Kaga"s aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the <a href="28%20January%20Incident">Shanghai Incident</a> of 1932 and participated in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in the late 1930s. With five other fleet carriers, she took part in the Pearl Harbor raid in December 1941 and the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">combined carrier airstrike</a> on <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Australia, helping secure the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">conquest</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> by Japanese forces. She missed the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">Indian Ocean raid</a> in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a reef in February. Following repairs, "Kaga" rejoined the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">1st Air Fleet</a> for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">attack on Midway Atoll</a> in June 1942.

The IJN was surprised by the appearance of three American carriers and, partly due to Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>'s plan in which ships were too dispersed to support each other, "Kaga", along with the other three carriers present, was sunk by aircraft from , and on 4 June.

Hilary of Chichester

Hilary (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1110–1169) was a medieval <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>. English by birth, he studied <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> and worked in Rome as a papal clerk. During his time there, he became acquainted with a number of ecclesiastics, including the future Pope <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Adrian IV</a>, and the writer <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a>. In England, he served as a clerk for <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, who was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and brother of King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen of England</a>. After Hilary's unsuccessful nomination to become <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, Pope <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Eugene III</a> compensated him by promoting him to the bishopric of Chichester in 1147.

Hilary spent many years in a struggle with <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a>, attempting to assert his right as bishop to oversee the abbey. He also clashed with <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, then chancellor to King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a>, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>; Hilary supported King Henry II's position in the conflict with Becket. Henry appointed Hilary as sheriff and employed him as a judge in the royal courts. The papacy also used Hilary as a <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">judge-delegate</a>, to hear cases referred back to England. Known for supporting his clergy and as a <a href="canon%20lawyer">canon lawyer</a>, or someone trained in <a href="ecclesiastical%20law">ecclesiastical law</a>, Hilary worked to have <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, a former English king, <a href="Canonization">canonised</a> as a <a href="saint">saint</a>.

Hilary was probably born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, but nothing is known of his ancestry. His brother was a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>, and they both may have come from around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29">Dean</a> of the church of <a href="Christchurch%2C%20Dorset">Christchurch</a> in Twynham, Hampshire (now Dorset), probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a <a href="Chapter%20%28religion%29">collegiate church</a> of <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a>, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the <a href="Apostolic%20Chancery">papal chancery</a>, or writing office, in 1146. Some of his coworkers in the chancery were <a href="Robert%20Pullen">Robert Pullen</a>, John of Salisbury, and <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Nicholas Breakspear</a> who later became pope, as Adrian IV.

As Dean of Christchurch, Hilary restored the organisation to its traditional round of religious ceremonies that had been abandoned by his predecessors, as well as securing grants of privileges and lands. He ordered the writing of a history of the church at Christchurch, a book which still survives. Hilary was unsuccessful as a candidate for the archbishopric of York against <a href="Henry%20Murdac">Henry Murdac</a> in 1147, but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chichester">see of Chichester</a>. His candidacy to York had been supported by <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh de Puiset</a>, then treasurer of York and later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, and by <a href="Robert%20of%20Ghent">Robert of Ghent</a>, who was <a href="Dean%20of%20York">Dean of York</a> and <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England, as well as by King Stephen of England. Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes, but because the election was disputed by Murdac's supporters the result was referred to the papacy, and Eugene chose Murdac. Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147, and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147. <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald of Bec</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated him at Canterbury, with <a href="Nigel%20%28Bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>, <a href="Robert%20of%20Bath">Robert</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath</a>, and <a href="William%20de%20Turbeville">William de Turbeville</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, assisting in the ceremony. For a number of years, Hilary continued to hold the deanship in <a href="Benefice">plurality</a>, which is the holding of two or more ecclesiastical benefices at once.

King Stephen sent Hilary to attend a <a href="Council%20of%20Reims%20%281148%29">church council</a> at <a href="Reims">Reims</a> in 1148 along with <a href="Robert%20de%20Bethune">Robert de Bethune</a>, who was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, and William de Turbeville. Theobald of Bec was also present, even though the king had forbidden him to attend. The medieval chronicler <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a> stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald's standing with the papacy, but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by insisting on the right to limit papal contact with the English bishops, something that his predecessors had always done.

Hilary attempted to excuse the king's attempt to exclude Theobald from the council, which appears to be the main reason why Stephen allowed Hilary to attend. Hilary was rewarded for his loyalty by being named a queen's chaplain. Soon after the council, Robert de Bethune died and <a href="Gilbert%20Foliot">Gilbert Foliot</a> was elected to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">see of Hereford</a>, at the direction of the pope. Theobald was in exile in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> because he had defied the king, so the pope ordered <a href="Robert%20de%20Sigello">Robert de Sigello</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, <a href="Josceline%20de%20Bohon">Josceline de Bohon</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and Hilary, to go to Flanders to help Theobald consecrate Gilbert. However, the three bishops were reluctant, and told the pope that because Gilbert had not received the royal assent, nor had he sworn fealty to Stephen, they would not consecrate him. Theobald then consecrated Gilbert with the help of some continental bishops. Hilary was one of the bishops who made peace between Theobald and Stephen after the council at Reims, helping in the negotiations after Theobald's return to England. Theobald settled at <a href="Hugh%20Bigod%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Hugh Bigod</a>'s castle of <a href="Framlingham">Framlingham</a>; negotiations between the royal party and the archbishop's party resulted in the king yielding and in the restoration of the archbishop to his lands.

Hilary struggled with the abbot of Battle Abbey for many years over the <a href="Exemption%20%28church%29">exemption</a> claimed by the abbey from the oversight of the Bishop of Chichester, in whose diocese it was located. The abbey had never received a papal exemption but relied instead on its royal foundation by <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William I of England</a>, and its status as an <a href="Proprietary%20church">eigenkirche</a>, or proprietary church of the king. Under Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. The appeal backfired when Hilary obtained from both Pope Eugene III and Adrian IV orders for the abbot to obey the bishop. In 1157, the then <a href="Abbot%20of%20Battle">Abbot of Battle</a>, <a href="Walter%20de%20Lucy">Walter de Lucy</a>, brother of <a href="Richard%20de%20Luci">Richard de Luci</a> the <a href="Justiciar">Chief Justiciar</a>, took the case before Henry II, at a council held at <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>.

At the council, Walter de Lucy produced William I's foundation charter and the confirmation by <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>, Henry II's grandfather. Both documents were admitted as genuine, and as freeing the abbey from <a href="ecclesiastical%20oversight">ecclesiastical oversight</a>, as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather's charters. Modern scholarship has shown, however, that at least one of the documents had been recently forged, shortly before 1155. Hilary argued that only a papal privilege could exempt a monastery from episcopal oversight and that the abbey had no such privilege. Hilary argued that no king could grant such an exemption unless they had a licence from the papacy. Henry was unimpressed by this argument, for it impinged on his royal prerogative. Thomas Becket, then Henry's chancellor but later to be famous for his dispute with Henry over <a href="ecclesiastical%20privileges">ecclesiastical privileges</a>, was one of Hilary's chief opponents at this council. Eventually, the case was decided by persuading Hilary to renounce any episcopal claims on the abbey.

Henry II's biographer, the historian W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed to bring the case against Battle Abbey by his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian <a href="Henry%20Mayr-Harting">Henry Mayr-Harting</a> sees the case against the abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.

The historian Nicholas Vincent argues that the entire basis of this account, which ultimately rests on the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Battle%20Abbey">Chronicle of Battle Abbey</a>", is part of the forgeries produced by the Battle monks. He argues that the only documentary evidence detailing the course of the legal battle besides the "Chronicle" is a forged charter of Henry II to the abbey and a letter of Theobald's that itself may be forged, as it repeats the story of the "Chronicle" almost word for word. Vincent's point is that although there was no doubt a dispute between Hilary and the abbey over a claimed exemption, as evidenced by an 1170 letter of Becket's referring to some sort of settlement between the monks and the bishop, the actual account in the "Chronicle" is untrustworthy. Unfortunately, the 1170 letter does not give any details of the dispute, merely stating that the bishop was "forced to make public peace with the abbot".

Hilary held the office of <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Sussex">Sheriff of Sussex</a> in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was a measure of the trust that King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold the office of sheriff during Henry's reign, with the possible exception of <a href="Robert%20de%20Chesney">Robert de Chesney</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.

Hilary created the offices of treasurer and chancellor of the diocese of Chichester, to regulate and improve the finances of the cathedral chapter and the diocese. He also was involved in the canonisation of Edward the Confessor, writing a letter to Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a> in favour of Edward's sainthood, and was one of the three bishops who announced the canonisation at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> and celebrated a mass in honour of the new saint.

In May 1162, Hilary was part of the deputation sent to the monks of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Christ Church Priory</a> by Henry II to secure the election of Thomas Becket as the next Archbishop of Canterbury. When Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of Hereford, objected to Becket's candidacy, Hilary took the position that the king desired the election, so the bishops and electors should elect the king's choice. When it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury, as had been the custom previously, Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God.

The next year, a council held at Westminster became one of the early stages in the king's growing <a href="Becket%20controversy">quarrel</a> with Becket over criminal clerks. The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of <a href="Holy%20Orders">clerical orders</a>, including the <a href="Minor%20orders">minor ones</a>, allowing this would have diminished the king's authority. In the past, English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts, but recent changes in canon law were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer canon law practices. All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law. Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath. Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position and threw their support behind Henry.

After the Council of Westminster, Hilary supported the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one factor in his royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also took part in the king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a>, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.

Hilary died in July 1169, probably on 13 July. The historian <a href="David%20Knowles%20%28scholar%29">David Knowles</a> described Hilary as "an extremely quick-witted, efficient, self-confident, voluble, somewhat shallow man, fully acquainted with the new canon law but not prepared to abide by principles to the end. His talents were great but he used them as an opportunist." In Hilary's favour, he was heavily involved in providing livings for the <a href="vicar">vicar</a>s who resided at the parish churches and performed the actual <a href="cure%20of%20souls">cure of souls</a>, or pastoral duties, in his diocese. He was also a benefactor of libraries, and worked hard to recover lands once belonging to his church but lost in the years of <a href="The%20Anarchy">Stephen's reign</a>. He also promoted clerical reform in his diocese, working to change many of the churches that had chapters of secular clergy into churches with chapters of <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian</a> canons. Hilary secured the consent of his cathedral chapter for any grants of lands, even those that he had acquired personally. Thirty-five documents survive from his bishopric, but few of them can be attributed to a specific date. One is his profession of obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the others are a mix of charters, judgements made by Hilary, and confirmations of rights and privileges.

Hilary's clerks were trained in administration, and one of them, his nephew Jocelin, was named chancellor of <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a> by his uncle. Jocelin later became <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Lewes">Archdeacon of Lewes</a>, and a royal judge. A number of Hilary's clerks served with Thomas Becket for a time, most of them after leaving Hilary's service.

Tomb of Antipope John XXIII

The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII is the <a href="marble">marble</a>-and-bronze <a href="tomb">tomb</a> <a href="Church%20monument">monument</a> of <a href="Antipope">Antipope</a> <a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">John XXIII</a> (Baldassare Cossa, c. 1360–1419), created by <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="Michelozzo">Michelozzo</a> for the <a href="Florence%20Baptistry">Florence Baptistry</a> adjacent to <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">the Duomo</a>. It was commissioned by the executors of Cossa's will after his death on December 22, 1419 and completed during the 1420s, establishing it as one of the early landmarks of <a href="History%20of%20Florence%23Renaissance%20Florence">Renaissance Florence</a>. According to <a href="Ferdinand%20Gregorovius">Ferdinand Gregorovius</a>, the tomb is "at once the <a href="sepulchre">sepulchre</a> of the <a href="Western%20Schism">Great Schism</a> in the church and the last <a href="list%20of%20extant%20papal%20tombs">papal tomb</a> which is outside Rome itself".

Cossa had a long history of cooperation with Florence, which had viewed him as the legitimate pontiff for a time during the <a href="Western%20Schism">Western Schism</a>. The tomb monument is often interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the legitimacy of Cossa's pontificate by linking him to the spiritually powerful site of the Baptistry. The evocation of papal symbolism on the tomb and the linkage between Cossa and Florence have been interpreted as a snub to Cossa's successor <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope Martin V</a> or vicarious "<a href="Medici">Medici</a> self-promotion", as such a tomb would have been deemed unacceptable for a Florentine citizen.

The tomb monument's design included figures of the <a href="Theological%20virtues">three Virtues</a> in <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a>s, Cossa's <a href="Coat%20of%20arms">family arms</a>, a gilded bronze <a href="effigy">recumbent effigy</a> laid out above an inscription-bearing <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> supported on corbel brackets, and above it a <a href="Madonna%20and%20Child">Madonna and Child</a> in a <a href="Lunette">half-lunette</a>, with a <a href="Baldachin">canopy</a> over all. At the time of its completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by <a href="art%20historian">art historian</a>s, as have the interpretations of its design and <a href="iconography">iconography</a>.

Antipope John XXIII had a complicated life, legacy, and relationship with the city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a <a href="Naples">Neapolitan</a> nobleman who grew up in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>. <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20IX">Pope Boniface IX</a> elevated Cossa to the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Bologna">Archdiocese of Bologna</a> in 1396 and made him a <a href="cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a> in 1402. After the <a href="Council%20of%20Pisa">Council of Pisa</a> in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XII">Pope Gregory XII</a>, who refused to resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by <a href="Antipope%20Alexander%20V">Antipope Alexander V</a>, who had been elected by the council.

Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by France, England, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, parts of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and <a href="Venice">Venice</a>; however, the <a href="Avignon%20Pope%20Benedict%20XIII">Avignon Pope Benedict XIII</a> was regarded as pope by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Kingdoms of Aragon</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and Gregory XII was still favored by <a href="Ladislaus%20of%20Naples">Ladislaus of Naples</a>, <a href="Carlo%20I%20Malatesta">Carlo I Malatesta</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Bavaria">princes of Bavaria</a>, <a href="Louis%20III%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Louis III</a>, <a href="Elector%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Elector of the Palatinate</a>, and parts of Germany and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29">Poland</a>.

When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, John XXIII was forced to flee to Florence. He was compelled by <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, to convoke the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a> in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him under the protection of <a href="Frederick%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Frederick IV, Duke of Austria</a>, it continued to operate where they were. As John XXIII tried to make his way towards the territory of <a href="John%20the%20Fearless">John II</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a>, Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.

In the meantime, the Council deposed John XXIII on May 29, 1415 and elected <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope Martin V</a> on November 11, 1417; Martin V proceeded to Florence in February 1419. Cossa was ransomed by the <a href="Republic%20of%20Florence">Republic of Florence</a> in 1419 (Louis III had abandoned the allegiance of Sigismund in 1417), as orchestrated by <a href="Giovanni%20di%20Bicci%20de%27%20Medici">Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici</a>. His ransom may have been a reward for past assistance to Florence, or a manoeuvre to put pressure on Martin V (still in Florence; he would arrive in Rome in September 1420), or both. Cossa had helped Florence conquer <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> in 1405 in his capacity as <a href="Papal%20legate">Papal legate</a> to Bologna and, as pope, had designated the <a href="Medici%20bank">Medici bank</a> as the depository-general for the papal finances.

In Florence, Cossa submitted to Martin V on June 14, 1419 and was rewarded with a cardinal's hat on June 26, only to die on December 22. Although given the title of Cardinal Bishop of <a href="Tusculum">Tusculum</a>, Cossa called himself "Cardinal of Florence".

Cossa's body was moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as prescribed by the "Ordo Romanus", was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white <a href="mitre">mitre</a> with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.

The commissioning of Cossa's tomb monument was negotiated for about a decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's <a href="will%20%28law%29">last will and testament</a>—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, but the bulk of his estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni. The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.

Cossa designated four prominent Florentines as his <a href="executor">executor</a>s: Bartolommeo di Taldo Valori, Niccolò da Uzzano, <a href="Giovanni%20di%20Bicci%20de%27%20Medici">Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici</a>, and Vieri Guadagni, allowing any two of the executors to act on behalf of all four, as Valori and Medici appear to have done. Valori died on September 2, 1427, by which time Guadagni was also deceased and Uzzano had long lost interest, leaving the remaining work of commissioning entirely to Giovanni, or—more likely—<a href="Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo de' Medici</a>.

The executors claimed that Cossa had revealed his desire for burial in the Baptistry to them but had been too modest to request it in his will. Most later scholars accept this testimony of the executors, attributing Cossa with "tact—and tactics", although at least one has postulated that the executors chose the site of the Baptistry against Cossa's wishes.
Documentary records indicate that, on January 9, 1421, <a href="Palla%20Strozzi">Palla Strozzi</a>, on behalf of the <a href="Arte%20di%20Calimala">Arte di Calimala</a>, the <a href="guild">guild</a> who were responsible for the upkeep of the Baptistry, authorized a ""breve et honestissima"" ("small and inconspicuous") monument in the Baptistry, but not the chapel requested by Cossa's will; present scholarship accepts Strozzi's assertion that burial within the Baptistry was a considerable honor, perhaps beyond the status of Cossa. After this meeting, there are no extant records from the Calimala regarding the tomb as the bulk of documents from the 1420s have been lost, although the notes of Senatore <a href="Carlo%20Strozzi">Carlo Strozzi</a>, who went through the records, are extant.

The Calimala's acquiescence is traditionally explained by Cossa's donation of the <a href="relic">relic</a> of the right <a href="index%20finger">index finger</a> of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> (and 200 <a href="Italian%20coin%20florin">florins</a> for an appropriate <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a>) to the Baptistry. With this finger John was believed to have pointed to Jesus, saying "<a href="Agnus%20Dei">Ecce Agnus Dei</a>" ("Behold the lamb of God") in . The long and complicated history of the relic would only have increased the legendary status of the finger: <a href="Patriarch%20Philotheus%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Philotheus Kokkinos</a>, <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> presented it in 1363 to <a href="Pope%20Urban%20V">Pope Urban V</a>, who passed it to his successors <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XI">Gregory XI</a> and <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VI">Urban VI</a>, who was dispossessed of it during the siege of <a href="Nocera%20Inferiore">Nocera</a>, after which John XXIII bought it for 800 florins and wore it on his person before hiding it in the monastery of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20degli%20Angeli%2C%20Florence">Santa Maria degli Angeli</a>.

The chronology of the tomb monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine <a href="Civil%20law%20notary">notary</a>, in 1424 (by the <a href="Florentine%20calendar">Florentine calendar</a>) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's "<a href="Catasto">Catasto</a>" from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner for about two years (""due anni o incircha"") and that three-fourths of the 800 florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.

On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici requested 400 of the 800 florins that had been deposited with the <a href="Arte%20dei%20Mercatanti%20o%20di%20Calimala">Calimala</a>, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, as it had been obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a>'s claim in his "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Excellent%20Painters%2C%20Sculptors%2C%20and%20Architects">Vite</a>" of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.

It is probable that the sarcophagus was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains to say a daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.

The exact date of completion is unknown but an extreme "<a href="Terminus%20post%20quem">terminus ante quem</a>" is given by the death in 1431 of Pope Martin V, who is known to have visited the completed tomb; other factors may push the "terminus ante quem" back significantly into the 1420s. The most reliable such indication is that in September 1428 <a href="Jacopo%20della%20Quercia">Jacopo della Quercia</a> returned to Bologna and produced a wall tomb with <a href="Virtues">Virtues</a> reflecting in minute details the Cossa Virtues.

Vasari suggests that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000 florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess. Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500 florins, yet its exactness may be taken with a <a href="grain%20of%20salt">grain of salt</a>.

The Baptistry already contained three <a href="sarcophagi">sarcophagi</a>: those of Bishop Ranieri (d. 1113) and two reused Roman sarcophagi. However, the tomb monument at in height was easily the tallest monument in the Baptistry, and—at the time—in Florence. The <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">Duomo</a> contains few tombs, with some notable exceptions, such as that of Aldobrandino Ottobuoni.

The tomb monument adapted to the conditions imposed by the Calimala and integrated with the interior of the Baptistry. The <a href="wall%20tomb">wall tomb</a> was required to be placed between two existing <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian column</a>s—those between <a href="Lorenzo%20Ghiberti">Ghiberti</a>'s North Doors and the western tribune—constituting one-third of one of the octagonal walls, near the altar and facing Ghiberti's East Doors. The setting starves the tomb monument of light, especially when the Baptistry's doors are closed, which is normally the case. It would be even darker were it not for the "screen" back wall protruding from the Baptistry wall. The white and brown (and whitish-brown) marble further integrates the structure with the <a href="polychromatic">polychromatic</a> white and green of the Baptistry interior. Some scholars accept the colored sketch of Buonaccorso Ghirberti as evidence that the "original effaced polychromy" of the tomb was more integrated, although others contend that the sketch is too inaccurate. The canopy's interaction with the columns and <a href="conceit">conceit</a> of being supported by the Baptistry cornice make the tomb monument further "wedded to the architecture" around it, even if the marriage is <a href="morganatic">morganatic</a>. Apart from the effigy on the sarcophagus, all the other sculpted figures are in <a href="high%20relief">high relief</a>.

Although the style of the work is thoroughly classicising, the overall form reflects the grandest type of the medieval Italian wall tomb, in which the vertical piling-up of a series of different elements is characteristic. Italian Gothic sculpture always retained considerable elements of classicism, and it was not necessary for Donatello and Michelozzo to adopt a radically original overall scheme from those of <a href="Tino%20di%20Camaino">Tino di Camaino</a> (c. 1285–1337), the <a href="Siena">Siennese</a> sculptor whose wall-tombs of a century before had been very influential throughout Italy. A life-size marble effigy lying on top of an elevated protruding sarcophagus is highly typical. The motif of curtains at the top is often found in monuments using Gothic decorative details, and the shape recalls the triangular <a href="gable">gable</a> tops of monuments in a more thoroughly Gothic style; other monuments have curtains, often held open by angels, around the effigy, and then sculptures above. The Cossa monument is often compared to the monument to <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge</a> <a href="Tommaso%20Mocenigo">Tommaso Mocenigo</a> of Venice, of 1423, which has high relief saints in shell niches on and above the sarcophagus, above which a large pair of curtains sweep up to a single terminal; however the architectural detailing here is Gothic. The design of the Cossa tomb itself was elaborated on, and adapted to local conventions, in the tomb by the same team for Cardinal Brancacci in Naples, and influenced the monument to <a href="Leonardo%20Bruni">Leonardo Bruni</a> by <a href="Bernardo%20Rossellino">Bernardo Rossellino</a>, of about 20 years later, in the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Santa%20Croce%2C%20Florence">Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence</a>.

The base slab, or <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>, of the tomb monument rests on a high <a href="plinth">plinth</a>, separated by a <a href="cornice">cornice</a> and <a href="wiktionary%3AConcave">concave</a> <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moulding</a>s. The pylon is high and wide, decorated with a <a href="frieze">frieze</a> of winged angel heads (perhaps <a href="seraphim">seraphim</a>) and <a href="Garland%20%28decoration%29">garland</a>s and ribbons.

Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the <a href="theological%20virtues">three Virtues</a>—from left to right, <a href="Faith">Faith</a>, <a href="Charity%20%28virtue%29">Charity</a>, and <a href="Hope%20%28virtue%29">Hope</a>—in shell niches, separated by four <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian</a> <a href="pilaster">fluted pilasters</a>. Such a motif is unprecedented in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscan</a> funerary sculpture but found at this date in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="Padua">Padua</a>, and especially Cossa's native <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello. However, Janson suggests that one "need not go all the way to Venice" to find such motifs. Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the <a href="cardinal%20Virtues">cardinal Virtues</a> used for <a href="laymen">laymen</a>, and the <a href="theological%20virtues">theological virtues</a> reserved for ecclesiastics, including the <a href="Brancaccio">Brancaccio</a> tomb. However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique. Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the <a href="Siena%20Cathedral%23Baptistry">Siena Baptistry</a>, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.

The tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>ic <a href="Chalice%20%28cup%29">chalice</a>; the tall Charity is holding a <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a> and a <a href="brazier">brazier</a> (or flaming vase); and the tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer. The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of <a href="Abundantia">Abundantia</a>, <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Ceres</a>, and <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a>, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the "immediacy" of the trope of <a href="lying%20in%20state">lying in state</a>, which was otherwise dominant on <a href="Quattrocento">Quattrocento</a> wall tombs.

Above the Virtues, four classical <a href="Corbel">consoles</a> decorated with <a href="acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> leaves support the sarcophagus. In the <a href="Triptych">tripartite</a> space between the consoles—from left to right—are Cossa's family arms with the <a href="papal%20tiara">papal tiara</a>, the papal <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>, and Cossa's family arms with the cardinal's hat. The "rilievo schiacciato" (a type of very shallow <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> pioneered by Donatello) on the <a href="architrave">architrave</a> sarcophagus ( wide and high) depicts two <a href="putto">putti</a> or spiratelli ("little spirits") holding open a large inscribed <a href="parchment">parchment</a>, perhaps in the style of a <a href="papal%20brief">papal brief</a>. The putti (or spiratelli) share many characteristics with their ancient counterparts, except for their crossed legs.
The inscription reads:

IOAN"n"ES QVO"n"DAM PAPA<br>
XXIII"us". OBIIT FLORENTIE A<br>
N"n"O D"omi"NI MCCCCXVIIII XI<br>
KALENDAS IANVARII
Which translates to:

John the former pope<br>
XXIII. Died in Florence<br>
A.D. 1419, on 11th<br>
day before the Calends of January

Pope Martin V objected to a portion of the inscription—"IOAN"n"ES QVO"n"DAM PAPA"—because he thought it implied Cossa had died as pope (the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "" could mean either "the former" or "the late"). The use of "olim Papa", as was common in many contemporary documents, instead of "quondam Papa" would probably have removed Martin V's objections. Martin himself suggested instead that Cossa be identified as a Neapolitan cardinal, thus emphasizing instead his submission. Contemporary sources report that the <a href="Signoria%20of%20Florence">Signoria</a> mimicked the reply of <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> regarding the inscription on the cross of Christ: "What is written, is written." Martin V himself was buried underneath an undecorated bronze floor slab, the only known example of a two-dimensional papal monument, although also the first to be set in the central nave of a major basilica, the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St.%20John%20Lateran">Basilica of St. John Lateran</a> in Rome, and cast in bronze.

According to Avery, Donatello's "Ascension of Christ and the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter" may have been intended to share the front of the sarcophagus, further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman <a href="Calends">Calends</a> of January, which was uncommon on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.

On top of the sarcophagus, the <a href="bier">bier</a> of the effigy is supported by lions whose shape mimics <a href="Trecento">Trecento</a> consoles. The lions may be based on the Florentine "", as if to mark John XXIII in the same manner as a conquered city-state. As Donatello's "Marzocco" for the papal apartment in <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Novella">Santa Maria Novella</a> conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d. 1342) in the <a href="Bargello">Bargello</a>.
The bier and the pall spread over it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion supporting the head standing shorter, increasing the visibility of the <a href="effigy">effigy</a>, especially the head. The <a href="gilding">gilded-bronze</a>, life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze. The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy. There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a gilt bronze statue on the balcony of the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20VIII">Pope Boniface VIII</a>.

Some scholars suggest that Donatello created the effigy with the aid of a <a href="death%20mask">death mask</a>, but others disagree.

Behind the effigy is a tripartite pylon with sunk molded borders supporting the cornice and framed by two additional Corinthian pilasters. Above it rests an <a href="entablature">entablature</a> of the <a href="Madonna%20and%20Child">Madonna and Child</a> on a <a href="Lunette">half-lunette</a>, a typical—symbolizing intercession—motif for a tomb. Above the effigy and Madonna is a gilt-edged architectonic canopy decorated with patterned stemmed flowers, giving the <a href="conceit">conceit</a> of being supported by the ribbed brass ring, an impossibility given its weight. McHam suggests that the canopy is based on the "Dome of Heaven", and thus the "<a href="Baldachin">baldacchino</a>" of papal enthronement. However, Lightbown is emphatic that the double-summited canopy looped against the pillars is not a baldacchino, but rather a secular bed-canopy.

The tomb monument was the first collaboration between <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="Michelozzo">Michelozzo</a>, who went on to collaborate on the <a href="tomb%20of%20Cardinal%20Rainaldo%20Brancacci">tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci</a> in the Church of <a href="Sant%27Angelo%20a%20Nilo">Sant'Angelo a Nilo</a> in Naples, the tomb of <a href="Prefecture%20of%20the%20Pontifical%20Household">Papal Secretary</a> Bartolomeo Aragazzi in what is now the <a href="Duomo">Duomo</a> of <a href="Montepulciano">Montepulciano</a>, and the external pulpit of the <a href="Prato%20Cathedral">Duomo of Prato</a>. At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and <a href="Orsanmichele">Orsanmichele</a>, while Michelozzo was more obscure. Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.

Nearly every element of the tomb monument has been attributed to both Donatello and Michelozzo by different <a href="art%20history">art historians</a>. These characterizations are mostly of <a href="historiography">historiographical</a> interest: attribution to Donatello is more of an indication of what is valued by each commentator than any objective criteria; often, aspects are attributed to Michelozzo explicitly because they are "less well executed".

Descriptions from 1475 to 1568 attribute all of the tomb except for the figure of Faith to Donatello. Some modern sources reverse this dichotomy, attributing all of the tomb to Michelozzo with the exception of the gilded bronze effigy. Some sources credit Donatello only with the bronze effigy. According to Janson, of the marble work, only the "<a href="putto">putti</a>" can be attributed to "Donatello's own hand". Donatello's alleged deficiencies in casting or in architecture have been proposed as the reason for his partnership with Michelozzo, in addition to his busy schedule.

SMS Prinz Adalbert (1901)

SMS "Prinz Adalbert" ("His Majesty's Ship "Prince Adalbert"") was an <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> built in the early 1900s for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy), named after <a href="Prince%20Adalbert%20of%20Prussia%20%281811%E2%80%931873%29">Prince Adalbert of Prussia</a>, former Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Prussian%20Navy">Prussian Navy</a>. She was the lead ship of <a href="Prinz%20Adalbert-class%20cruiser">her class</a>, which included a second ship, . "Prinz Adalbert" was built at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. Her <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid in April 1900, and she was launched in June 1901. Her completion in January 1904 had been delayed by a surplus of construction projects at the Imperial Dockyard. She was armed with a main battery of four guns, a significant improvement over the previous armored cruiser, , which carried only two such guns. The ship was capable of a top speed of .

Upon commissioning, "Prinz Adalbert" served as a gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>, a role she held for the majority of her career. She trained with the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet), later renamed the "<a href="Hochseeflotte">Hochseeflotte</a>" (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries. After the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the cruiser <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> in the Baltic. She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a> in support of the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a>. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired. She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915; the torpedo detonated her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazines">ammunition magazine</a>s and destroyed the ship. She sank quickly with heavy loss of life; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675. This proved to be the worst German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war.

"Prinz Adalbert" was the second member of the , which were ordered under the Second <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> of 1900. The law called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers that would be able to serve in <a href="German%20colonial%20empire">Germany's colonial empire</a> and scout for the main German fleet in home waters. The need to fill both roles was the result of budgetary limitations, which prevented Germany from building vessels specialized to each task. The "Prinz Adalbert" design was based on that of the previous <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>, , which incorporated a more powerful armament and more comprehensive armor protection.

"Prinz Adalbert" displaced as built and fully loaded, with a length of , a beam of and a draft of forward. She was powered by three vertical <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">triple-expansion steam engines</a>, with steam provided by fourteen coal-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s. The engines developed and yielded a maximum speed of on trials. She carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of . The ship's crew consisted of 35 officers and 551 enlisted men.

She was armed with four <a href="21%20cm%20SK%20L/40">guns</a> arranged in two twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one on either end of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, a significant improvement over "Prinz Heinrich", which carried only two guns in single turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of ten <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 in) guns</a>, twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">guns</a> and four underwater <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one in the <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>, one in the <a href="stern">stern</a>, and one on each <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a>. The ship was protected by a <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> consisting of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armor">Krupp cemented armor</a>, along with an armored <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> that was thick. Her <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> turrets had faces thick.

"Prinz Adalbert" was ordered under the provisional name ""B"" and built at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> under <a href="yard%20number">construction number</a> 27. Her keel was laid in April 1900 and she was launched on 22 June 1901. The launching ceremony was attended by the Kaiser, <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a>, his wife Kaiserin <a href="Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Augusta Victoria</a>, his brother Admiral <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a> and Wilhem's son, <a href="Prince%20Adalbert%20of%20Prussia%20%281884%E2%80%931948%29">Prince Adalbert of Prussia</a>. The ceremony of christening the ship was performed by <a href="Princess%20Irene%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Irene of Prussia</a>, wife of Prince Heinrich, who then delivered a speech. <a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a> work proceeded slowly, in large part the result of the Imperial Dockyard attempting to build too many ships at once, but the work was eventually completed by 12 January 1904. "Prinz Adalbert" was commissioned into the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> the same day for <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, with "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain at Sea) <a href="Hermann%20Jacobsen">Hermann Jacobsen</a> in command; the ship was slated for service as a gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>. She had cost the Imperial German Government 16,371,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">"Goldmarks"</a>. Sea trials were completed by 30 May, after which "Prinz Adalbert" began her duties as a gunnery training ship.

In September, the ship took part in the annual autumn maneuvers with the rest of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). A special training unit consisting of reserve ships, training ships like "Prinz Adalbert", and a flotilla of <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s was created in early 1905; "Prinz Adalbert" was the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the unit from 1905 to 1907, flying the flag of "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Hugo%20Zeye">Hugo Zeye</a>. "Prinz Adalbert" and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> escorted <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>'s yacht <a href="SMY%20Hohenzollern">"Hohenzollern"</a> to Sweden for a visit to King <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">Oscar II</a> in July 1905. The following month, she joined the light cruisers and for training maneuvers off <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>; the exercises were to test the ships against a simulated night attack by torpedo boats. The tests were observed by "Konteradmiral" <a href="Ludwig%20Schr%C3%B6der">Ludwig Schröder</a>, the Inspector of Naval Weapons, aboard "Prinz Adalbert". Wilhelm II boarded "Prinz Adalbert" for the conclusion of the exercises, in which the ship towed an old torpedo boat filled with <a href="cork%20%28material%29">cork</a> while the light cruisers and torpedo boats fired on it with live shells. "Prinz Adalbert" did not participate in the 1905 autumn maneuvers, though she was present for the <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> at the end of the exercises on 13 September. In February 1906, the <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> was assigned to support "Prinz Adalbert". From 17 to 28 June, the cruiser served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich, then the commander of the Baltic Sea Naval Station. During this period the ship traveled to Norway to take part in the coronation festivities for King <a href="Haakon%20VII">Haakon VII</a>.

The cruiser again took part in the autumn maneuvers in 1907 and 1909. During the latter maneuvers, "Prinz Adalbert" took part in the Reserve Division, commanded again by Zeye, who had now been promoted to "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral). The ship served as the flagship of the <a href="III%20Scouting%20Group">III Scouting Group</a>, under "Konteradmiral" <a href="Johannes%20Merten">Johannes Merten</a>, who would go on to command the Ottoman fortifications at the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In March 1910 and March 1911, "Prinz Adalbert" conducted gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited <a href="T%C3%B3rshavn">Tórshavn</a> and <a href="Vestmanna">Vestmanna</a> in the <a href="Faeroe%20Islands">Faeroe Islands</a>. She visited <a href="%C3%85lesund">Ålesund</a> in Norway in July and August that year. The ship's first period in service came to an end in September, following a large naval review in the Kiel <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> for Wilhelm II and <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>, the heir to the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> throne, which began on 5 September. "Prinz Adalbert" was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th, with the armored cruiser taking her place as the fleet's gunnery training ship. After a lengthy <a href="%3Awikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a>, "Prinz Adalbert" returned to service on 1 November 1912, again with the artillery school. She was based in <a href="Sonderburg">Sonderburg</a>, where she replaced the armored cruiser "Prinz Heinrich".

At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, "Prinz Adalbert" was brought into front-line service with the fleet, and "Kapitän zur See" <a href="Andreas%20Michelsen">Andreas Michelsen</a> took command of the ship. She was assigned to the <a href="IV%20Scouting%20Group">IV Scouting Group</a>, under the command of "Konteradmiral" <a href="Hubert%20von%20Rebeur-Paschwitz">Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz</a>. On 26 August, she was sent to rescue the light cruiser , which had run aground earlier that day, though she was recalled after the Germans received word that "Magdeburg"s crew had been forced to <a href="scuttling">scuttle</a> the ship. "Prinz Adalbert" was transferred to the North Sea on 7 September and was tasked two days later with protecting the minelaying cruisers and and the auxiliary minelayer "Kaiser" while they laid a minefield to protect the southern entrance to the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>. The ship was briefly detached to guard the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> after the Germans received false intelligence suggesting that British warships would try to penetrate the Baltic. She then joined the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for a sortie into the North Sea on 2–4 November.

After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, "Prinz Adalbert" was detached from the IV Scouting Group to replace her in the Coastal Defense Division in the Baltic on 29 November. She became the flagship for Admiral <a href="Ehler%20Behring">Ehler Behring</a>, the commander of the cruiser detachment in the Baltic, on 7 December. On the 15th, she sortied with the light cruisers , , , and and several torpedo boats for a reconnaissance sweep toward the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a>; the ships returned to port on 18 December without having engaged Russian forces. Another sweep followed on 27–29 December, this time to cover a sortie by the of the <a href="V%20Battle%20Squadron">V Battle Squadron</a> toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 6 January 1915, "Prinz Adalbert", "Thetis", "Augsburg", "Lübeck", and several torpedo boats and <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s went on a patrol toward <a href="Ut%C3%B6%20%28Finland%29">Utö</a>, where they discovered a Russian base for <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. The Germans planned to attack the base with the torpedo boats and "Thetis", since she had the shallowest draft, but due to a miscommunication, the attack was not carried out.

On 22 January 1915, "Prinz Adalbert", in company with "Augsburg" and several torpedo boats, conducted another reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands. While on the return voyage, she bombarded Russian positions at <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. She ran aground off <a href="Gle%C5%BAnowo">Steinort</a> during the operation, and "Augsburg" struck a mine off <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>. After being freed from her grounding, the ship was repaired; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was ready to return to service. Behring returned to "Prinz Adalbert" on 20 March. In the meantime, the Russians had briefly captured <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Memel</a>. The "<a href="Admiralstab">Admiralstab</a>" (Admiralty Staff) detached the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a>, <a href="II%20Scouting%20Group">II Scouting Group</a>, and two flotillas of torpedo boats from the High Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic. The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a>'s campaign to retake Memel; "Prinz Adalbert" supported one such operation, a raid of the II Scouting Group into the <a href="Bothnian%20Sea">Bothnian Sea</a> to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March. The following day, the ships from the High Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea, leaving Behring's cruisers alone once again.

Behring conducted one last operation from 13 to 17 April, with "Prinz Adalbert", "Thetis", and "Lübeck", to support the minelayer , which laid a minefield off <a href="Hiiumaa">Dagö</a>. On the 20th, the "Admiralstab" instituted a reorganization of the Baltic Sea forces, and Behring was replaced with "Konteradmiral" <a href="Albert%20Hopman">Albert Hopman</a>. At the same time, Michelsen was promoted to Hopman's chief of staff, with his place as "Prinz Adalbert"s commanding officer being taken by "Kapitän zur See" Wilhelm Bunnemann. The ship remained the flagship of the unit, and Hopman made his first cruise aboard the vessel from Kiel to Danzig on 27 April. At this time, "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (General Field Marshal) <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a>, the commander in chief of German forces on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a>, ordered a major assault on Libau. Hopman ordered his forces to support an attempt by the German Army to seize the city. The pre-dreadnoughts of the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a> and the IV Scouting Group were allocated to Hopman's command to provide additional support to the operation. The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of "Prinz Adalbert" and the armored cruisers and "Prinz Heinrich", the elderly <a href="Coastal%20defence%20ship">coast defense ship</a> , and the cruisers "Augsburg", "Thetis", and "Lübeck". They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault and they took the city.

On 1 July, the minelayer , escorted by the cruisers "Roon", "Augsburg", and "Lübeck" and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of <a href="Bogsk%C3%A4r">Bogskär</a>. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; "Augsburg", "Albatross", and three destroyers made for <a href="Rixh%C3%B6ft">Rixhöft</a> while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. "Augsburg" and "Albatross" were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore <a href="Johannes%20von%20Karpf">Johannes von Karpf</a>, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower "Albatross" to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled "Roon" and "Lübeck". "Albatross" was grounded off Gotland and "Augsburg" escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged "Roon" before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with "Prinz Adalbert" and "Prinz Heinrich" to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on "Prinz Adalbert". The torpedo hit below the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, caused severe damage, and killed ten men. Hopman transferred to the torpedo boat while Michelsen remained aboard "Prinz Adalbert" to oversee the return to port. The ship took on some of water; her draft increased significantly, which prevented her from being able to put into <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. She instead had to make the journey back to Kiel for repairs, which she reached on 4 July.

Repairs were finally completed by September 1915. On 21 September, "Prinz Adalbert" joined a sortie to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> with the battleships , , , , and and the light cruiser . They encountered no Russian forces and returned to port on the 23rd. Another operation followed on 5 October; this was in company with "Prinz Heinrich" and "Bremen", and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field to the northwest of <a href="%C3%96stergarn">Östergarn</a>. The ships completed their mission the next day and returned to port without incident. On 19 October, Hopman transferred his flag to "Roon" and ordered "Prinz Adalbert" to take up a patrol between <a href="F%C3%A5r%C3%B6">Fårö</a> and <a href="Dagerort">Dagerort</a>. The ship was steaming some 20 miles west of Libau, en route to her patrol area, in company with a pair of destroyers on 23 October when she was intercepted by the submarine . "E8" fired a spread of torpedoes at a range of approximately 1,200 m (1,300 yd), detonating the ship's <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">ammunition magazine</a>. The massive explosion destroyed the ship, which sank immediately with the loss of 672 crew. There were only three survivors. The sinking was the greatest single loss of life for the German Baltic forces during the war.

Robert de Chesney

Robert de Chesney (died December 1166) was a medieval English <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. He was the brother of an important royal official, <a href="William%20de%20Chesney">William de Chesney</a>, and the uncle of <a href="Gilbert%20Foliot">Gilbert Foliot</a>, successively <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Leicester">Archdeacon of Leicester</a> before his election as bishop in December 1148.

Chesney served as a <a href="royal%20justice">royal justice</a> in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen of England</a>, including the right to a <a href="Mint%20%28facility%29">mint</a>, Chesney was present at the coronation of King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with <a href="St%20Albans%20Abbey">St Albans Abbey</a> in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.

Chesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an <a href="Lincoln%20Medieval%20Bishop%27s%20Palace">episcopal palace</a> in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in <a href="Lincoln%20Cathedral">Lincoln Cathedral</a>.

After <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>'s death in 1135, the succession was disputed as the king's only legitimate son, <a href="William%20Adelin">William</a>, had <a href="White%20Ship">died in 1120</a>. The main contenders were the king's nephews, <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen, Count of Boulogne</a> and his elder brother <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald II, Count of Champagne</a>, and his surviving legitimate daughter, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to <a href="Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey, Count of Anjou</a>. All the magnates of England and <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> were required to declare <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a>, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, Earl of Gloucester</a>, an illegitimate son of Henry I, in 1138.

Stephen was initially secure on his throne but, by 1139, stresses had appeared. David I invaded England in 1138, and some of the English nobles rebelled, but Stephen had dealt with both threats by April 1139. Later that year, he arrested <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and his nephews <a href="Nigel%20%28Bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a> and <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, who were not only powerful ecclesiastics but important royal administrators. In September 1139, Matilda landed in England to contest the throne, supported by her half-brother Robert. Stephen himself was captured in February 1141 by Matilda's forces, but Robert's subsequent capture by forces loyal to Stephen later that year allowed his exchange for Stephen in November 1141. The result was an effective stalemate, with Stephen controlling parts of the country and others under the control of Matilda's supporters. During the 1140s, Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, wrested Normandy from Stephen.

Chesney's family originated from <a href="Quesnay-Guesnon">Quesnay-Guesnon</a> in the <a href="Calvados%20%28department%29">Calvados</a> region of Normandy near <a href="Bayeux">Bayeux</a> in France, but they had settled in the <a href="The%20Midlands">Midlands</a> of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, and became one of Oxfordshire's leading landowners. Another brother, <a href="Reginald%20Foliot">Reginald</a>, was the abbot of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a>. Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Earl of Huntingdon</a>. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney, it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.

Chesney probably attended schools in either Oxford or Paris, as later in life he was referred to with the title of "magister", signifying that he was educated. He was Archdeacon of Leicester by about 1146, and held the <a href="prebend">prebend</a> of Stow. He was also a <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of the chapel of St. George at <a href="Oxford%20Castle">Oxford Castle</a>.

Chesney was elected to the <a href="See%20of%20Lincoln">See of Lincoln</a> on 13 December 1148, by his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, apparently without outside interference. He was consecrated by <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald of Bec</a> at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> on 19 December, the day after his ordination as a priest.

Gilbert Foliot's letters provide some background to Chesney's election, showing that King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, attempted to secure Lincoln for one of their relatives: the royal candidates were the abbots of <a href="F%C3%A9camp%20Abbey">Fécamp</a>, <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a>, and <a href="St%20Benet%27s%20Abbey">St Benet's of Hulme</a>. They were rejected by <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Pope Eugene III</a>, paving the way for the chapter to elect Chesney. Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London, where they proceeded to elect Chesney in front of Foliot, Theobald, and some other bishops. That account is contradicted by Chesney's profession of obedience to Theobald, which claims that the election took place on 13 December 1148 at Westminster. <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> and <a href="Ralph%20de%20Diceto">Ralph de Diceto</a>, both medieval chroniclers, approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney's selection. That Chesney's brother William was a firm supporter of Stephen's probably helped reconcile Stephen and his brother to Chesney's election.

Chesney returned to Lincoln on 6 January 1149, where he received a letter from <a href="Arnulf%20of%20Lisieux">Arnulf</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lisieux">Bishop of Lisieux</a> in Normandy, congratulating him on his appointment. Arnulf also asked Chesney to help the cause of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry fitzEmpress</a>, Empress Matilda's eldest son and a contender for the English throne.

Correspondence between Chesney and his nephew <a href="Gilbert%20Foliot">Gilbert Foliot</a> suggests their relationship was quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election. Foliot later ordered a copy of the "<a href="Pandects">Digest</a>" for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a>. Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a>'s collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from <a href="Gratian%20%28jurist%29">Gratian</a>'s "<a href="Decretum%20Gratiani">Decretum</a>" in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.

Shortly after his consecration, Chesney was presented with a copy of the newly updated version of Henry of Huntingdon's "<a href="Historia%20Anglorum%20%28Henry%20of%20Huntingdon%29">Historia Anglorum</a>"; Huntingdon had been a fellow archdeacon. Chesney was present at several of King Stephen's courts, and the king named the bishop as the local justice for Lincolnshire.

At the height of <a href="The%20Anarchy">the civil war</a> during Stephen's reign, and shortly after Chesney's consecration, the bishop acted as a guarantor for the treaty between <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Gernon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf de Gernon</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>, and <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert de Beaumont</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a>, drawn up to limit the fighting between the two earls during the civil war. Chesney was present at the legatine council held by Theobald in March 1151, and was one of the judges, along with Theobald and <a href="Hilary%20of%20Chichester">Hilary of Chichester</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>, in a dispute between the monks of <a href="Belvoir%20Priory">Belvoir Priory</a> and a secular clerk over the right of the clerk to a church. Chesney appointed the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, to a prebend in his cathedral chapter during the latter part of Stephen's reign.

The civil war ended with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Winchester">Treaty of Winchester</a>, late in 1153, which provided that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. In the last year of Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint in the town of Newark, granted in perpetuity. But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln, and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of <a href="Banbury">Banbury</a> in 1154.

Chesney witnessed a charter of Henry fitzEmpress' before Henry's succession to the throne as Henry II, and was present at the consecration of <a href="Roger%20de%20Pont%20L%27%C3%89v%C3%AAque">Roger de Pont L'Évêque</a> as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> on 10 October 1154. The bishop then was present at Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154, and appears to have continued to act as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during the early part of King Henry II's reign; the 1156 <a href="Pipe%20Roll">Pipe Roll</a> has the sheriff of the county accounting for 10 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">marks</a> arising from the pleas of the bishop in the county. Chesney was often with the royal court, as he attested a number of Henry II's charters during the early part of the king's reign, and accompanied him to northern England in 1158 and to Normandy in 1160.

The bishop served as the judge in a dispute in 1158 between a dean from the <a href="diocese%20of%20York">diocese of York</a> and a citizen of Scarborough, in which the layman alleged that the dean had extorted large sums of money from him by repeatedly charging his wife with adultery and fining her. The dean's actions were contrary to a royal decree, but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.

In 1161 Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey, resulting from his efforts to enforce his right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard by a panel of two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead. In 1155–1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Pope Adrian IV</a>, who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it was these privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey as they were in the time of King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of <a href="Offa%20of%20Mercia">Offa of Mercia</a> in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal <a href="proprietary%20church">proprietary church</a>, and thus had special exemptions. In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.

Early in 1162 Chesney was summoned to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh de Puiset</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the election of Thomas Becket to the see of Canterbury. In July 1163, Chesney was present at the royal court held at <a href="Woodstock%20Palace">Woodstock Palace</a>, which included the Welsh prince <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Gruffydd">Rhys ap Gruffydd</a>, the prince of Northern Wales <a href="Owain%20Gwynedd">Owain Gwynedd</a>, and King <a href="Malcolm%20IV%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm IV of Scotland</a>. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at this court. In 1163 Chesney was excused from attending a papal council at <a href="Tours">Tours</a> because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of <a href="Council%20of%20Clarendon">Clarendon</a> and <a href="Council%20of%20Northampton">Northampton</a> in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket controversy</a>, between the king and Becket. At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade Becket to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166.

Chesney's contributions to the king's military campaigns on the continent caused him financial difficulties; at the time of his death he was in debt to a moneylender.

Chesney's "acta", or documents, contain many examples of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active he was in his diocese. More than 240 of his "acta" have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">papal judge-delegate</a> at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.

In addition to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure good relations with his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed unlicensed schools in Huntingdon and employed a number of educated clerks; his "acta" almost always include one witness entitled "magister", and often as many as six.

Chesney was a builder in his diocese, where he ordered the construction of the episcopal palace. He also founded a <a href="Gilbertine%20Order">Gilbertine</a> house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.

The exact date of Chesney's death is uncertain. It may have been 27 December 1166; the event is commemorated on both 26 and 27 December. He was buried in the eastern cross aisle of Lincoln Cathedral, along the north side. The modern historian <a href="David%20Knowles%20%28scholar%29">David Knowles</a> wrote that Chesney was "not a man of strong character or decided opinions".

Chesney left at least ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a uniformity of handwriting, leading to speculation that there may have been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.

In addition to Foliot, the brothers Gerard, a canon of Lincoln, and Martin, treasurer of Lincoln, were also Chesney's nephews. He may also have been related to Fulk de Chesney, another canon at Lincoln. Chesney helped to further the career of <a href="Richard%20Barre">Richard Barre</a>, who became a writer and a royal judge and first appears in the record as a witness to some of Chesney's documents during 1160–1164. <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>'s last work, the "<a href="Vita%20Merlini">Vita Merlini</a>", was dedicated to Chesney. Foliot owned a copy of the "<a href="Digest%20%28Roman%20law%29">Digest</a>", part of the "<a href="Corpus%20Juris%20Civilis">Corpus iuris civilis</a>", that had originally been <a href="gloss%20%28annotation%29">gloss</a>ed for Chesney.

Traditionally, Chesney's predecessor Alexander has been credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of <a href="Tournai%20marble">Tournai marble</a>. Recent scholarship has cast doubt upon this idea, and suggests that the font was instead carved on Chesney's orders, and commissioned after 1150.

2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game

The 2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game was a regular season <a href="college%20football">college football</a> game between the <a href="2007%20Appalachian%20State%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">Appalachian State Mountaineers</a> and <a href="2007%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">Michigan Wolverines</a>. It was held at <a href="Michigan%20Stadium">Michigan Stadium</a> in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> on September 1, 2007, and was the first game of the season for both teams. The Wolverines entered the game ranked No. 5 in both major <a href="Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision">Football Bowl Subdivision</a> (FBS) polls and media outlets considered them to be preseason favorites to win the <a href="Big%20Ten">Big Ten</a> conference championship as well as possible contenders for the national championship, while the Mountaineers were ranked No. 1 in <a href="The%20Sports%20Network%20%28wire%20service%29">The Sports Network</a>'s <a href="Football%20Championship%20Subdivision">Football Championship Subdivision</a> (FCS) poll and were preseason favorites to win their third consecutive FCS <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Championship">national championship</a>.

Games between FBS and FCS teams typically result in lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game was not expected to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new <a href="Big%20Ten%20Network">Big Ten Network</a>. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead at the end of the half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26 seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.

Immediately hailed as one of the greatest upsets in college football history, the game served as the lead story of "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>" and was the cover story for the following week's edition of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>". Appalachian State became the second FCS team to defeat a ranked FBS team, and as a result of the game Michigan dropped out of the top 25 of the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a> entirely, marking the first time a team had fallen from the top five to out of the poll entirely as the result of a single game. In the aftermath of the game, the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> amended their polling policy to make FCS teams eligible for the AP Poll, which had previously been limited to FBS teams.

The Appalachian State Mountaineers finished the 2007 season with a 13–2 record and won a third consecutive FCS title. They also became the first FCS team to receive votes in the final AP Poll, tying <a href="South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football">South Florida</a> for the 34th overall ranking. Michigan finished their season 9–4, winning the <a href="Capital%20One%20Bowl">Capital One Bowl</a>, and ranked No. 18 in the final AP Poll. A rematch in 2014 at Michigan Stadium was won decisively by the Wolverines, 52–14. The 2014 rematch was the Mountaineers' first game as an FBS school.

The <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) is split into three divisions: <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I">Division I</a>, <a href="NCAA%20Division%20II">Division II</a>, and <a href="NCAA%20Division%20III">Division III</a>. According to the NCAA, Division I consists of "the largest programs that provide the most athletically related financial aid for student-athletes". Division I football is split into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" notes that the FBS is considered the tier at which major Division I universities play, while the FCS is a tier in which smaller programs compete. FBS member teams are allowed to have up to 85 scholarship players, while FCS member teams are allowed to award 63 scholarships. However, FCS teams can divide their 63 scholarships by giving some players 'partial scholarships'. FBS teams vie to play in <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a>s, while FCS teams aim to qualify for a <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Championship">postseason tournament</a>. The two subdivisions were created in 1978, and no other Division I sports are split in such a manner. The difference between the two subdivisions is great enough that <a href="John%20V.%20Lombardi">John V. Lombardi</a>, a former chancellor at <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">UMass</a>, which played FCS football before moving to FBS in 2012, and a former president at FBS-level <a href="University%20of%20Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State</a>, said that "even a crummy team in [FBS] football has higher visibility than a great team in [FCS]."

FBS teams are allowed to schedule FCS teams, and one win against an FCS team can be counted towards their <a href="bowl%20eligibility">bowl-eligible</a> status provided the FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements. FCS teams are often paid upwards of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a> $500,000 for participating in games against FBS teams. This arrangement generally results in lopsided losses for FCS teams, but the money FCS schools earn from games against FBS teams helps fund their athletic departments, as well as offering broader exposure for their athletic programs.

Appalachian State had routinely scheduled FBS teams, playing against schools such as <a href="1999%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team">Auburn</a> in 1999, <a href="2005%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football%20team">Kansas</a> and <a href="2005%20LSU%20Tigers%20football%20team">LSU</a> in 2005, and <a href="2006%20NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football%20team">NC State</a> in 2006. They also had games against <a href="Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football">Wake Forest</a> in every season from 1979 to 1996, as well as in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these games, all of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten an FBS team since 2000. Michigan, a historic college football power with a large fan base, had never played an FCS team. According to Appalachian State athletic director Charlie Cobb, both schools had gaps in their schedule as late as February 2007; the friendship between Mountaineers coach <a href="Jerry%20Moore%20%28American%20football%2C%20born%201939%29">Jerry Moore</a> and Wolverines coach <a href="Lloyd%20Carr">Lloyd Carr</a> played a key role in completing the deal. While attempting to determine the amount of money Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, negotiations between the two schools reached a halt. Moore went to school officials and urged them to accept any offer Michigan gave them; he recalled telling them that "It's an opportunity game. It'll be a one-shot, once-in-a-lifetime deal to go up there and play. It's an unbelievable environment." Appalachian State ultimately settled on a $400,000 payment in return for playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season.

Michigan was expected to handily defeat Appalachian State, who entered the game as considerable underdogs. Las Vegas sports books did not offer a betting line because they believed that it would be a mismatch. The day before the game, an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> article said that the Mountaineers were "almost certain to lose badly" and "aren't expected to be anything more than sacrificial lambs." Another article predicted that Michigan would easily win, but that Michigan's inexperienced secondary could possibly be tested by quarterback <a href="Armanti%20Edwards">Armanti Edwards</a>. This weakness is what the Mountaineers hoped to capitalize on: they spent most of the week leading up to the game studying game film, and felt that the Michigan defense had a tendency to leave the middle of the field defenseless. On the other hand, the Mountaineers lacked the depth of the Wolverines, having 22 fewer scholarship players.

Appalachian State were ranked as the No. 1 team in the preseason FCS poll from <a href="The%20Sports%20Network%20%28wire%20service%29">The Sports Network</a>, receiving 67 out of 70 first-place votes. The team had won the previous two FCS national championships and were favorites to win a third consecutive title according to media outlets. They had also won their last 14 games, the longest in either Division I subdivision at the time. They had an overall record of 6–34–1 against major FBS teams. The Mountaineers ran a <a href="Hurry-up%20offense">no-huddle</a>, spread option system, which they implemented in 2005, their first championship season. Two of the major offensive weapons for the team were Edwards, who had scored 15 passing touchdowns and 15 rushing touchdowns in 2006, and running back <a href="Kevin%20Richardson%20%28American%20football%29">Kevin Richardson</a>, who had scored an FCS-record 30 rushing touchdowns in 2006. The defensive unit for the Mountaineers was helmed by <a href="Corey%20Lynch">Corey Lynch</a>, a <a href="Safety%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%20position%29">safety</a>; the Mountaineer defense ranked 11th in rush defense and 35th in pass defense during the <a href="2006%20Appalachian%20State%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">2006 season</a>, but the team lost five of its six best tacklers from that season, as well as defensive lineman <a href="Marques%20Murrell">Marques Murrell</a>, who led the FCS in sacks during the 2006 season. Despite losses at the defensive line, the secondary, the team's defensive strong point, remained virtually intact from the previous season. The Mountaineers' kicker was senior Julian Rauch, who made 10 out of 14 field goal attempts during the 2006 season.

Michigan entered the game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">Coaches' Poll</a>. Media outlets projected the team as favorites to win the <a href="Big%20Ten">Big Ten</a> conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle <a href="Jake%20Long">Jake Long</a>, tailback <a href="Mike%20Hart%20%28American%20football%29">Mike Hart</a>, and quarterback <a href="Chad%20Henne">Chad Henne</a>, each of whom had decided to stay in school rather than declare eligibility for the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20Draft">NFL Draft</a>. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival <a href="Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football">Ohio State</a> and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. <a href="Mark%20Schlabach">Mark Schlabach</a> of <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a> stated that "[the trio], along with receivers <a href="Mario%20Manningham">Mario Manningham</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Arrington">Adrian Arrington</a>, gives Michigan what could potentially be one of the most explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captains</a>, along with linebacker <a href="Shawn%20Crable">Shawn Crable</a>, a fifth-year senior. Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver <a href="Formation%20%28American%20football%29">formation</a>, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that "when you have some of the skill that we have at the wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [a] positive." At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four <a href="All-America">All-America</a>ns (cornerback <a href="Leon%20Hall">Leon Hall</a> and defensive linemen <a href="Alan%20Branch">Alan Branch</a>, <a href="David%20Harris%20%28American%20football%29">David Harris</a>, and <a href="LaMarr%20Woodley">LaMarr Woodley</a>), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the <a href="2007%20NFL%20Draft">2007 NFL Draft</a>. Wolverines linebacker <a href="Chris%20Graham%20%28American%20football%29">Chris Graham</a>, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was "loaded in speed".

The game was the first ever to be broadcast on the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Network">Big Ten Network</a>. At the time the network had approximately 17 million subscribers, most of which came from a deal with <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a>. According to Mark Silverman, the president of the Big Ten Network, only a "small percentage" of Wolverine fans were able to watch it. Silverman attributed this to the fact that <a href="Comcast">Comcast</a> and <a href="Charter%20Communications">Charter</a>, two of the major cable television providers in the state of Michigan, did not carry the Big Ten Network. <a href="Thom%20Brennaman">Thom Brennaman</a> provided play-by-play commentary, <a href="Charles%20Davis%20%28football%20player%29">Charles Davis</a> performed as the color analyst, and <a href="Charissa%20Thompson">Charissa Thompson</a> reported from the sidelines. The game marked Thompson's debut as a sideline analyst on any network, while Brennaman and Davis were more experienced, having covered high-profile college football games such as the <a href="2007%20Fiesta%20Bowl">2007 Fiesta Bowl</a> and the <a href="2007%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">2007 BCS National Championship Game</a> for Fox Sports.

The weather during the game was clear and sunny, with temperatures in the mid-70s °F (low-20s °C) and wind heading north at 10–15 miles (16–24 kilometers) per hour. The referee, the head of the <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29">officiating team</a>, was John O'Neill. Overall attendance was recorded as 109,218. The game kicked off at 12:07 p.m. and ended at 3:40 p.m., having lasted a total of three hours and thirty-seven minutes.

Michigan received the ball first, with Mike Massey returning the Julian Rauch kick to the Michigan 33-yard line. Michigan gained a first down after converting a third and one with a three-yard run by Mike Hart. Chad Henne then completed an 18-yard pass to Massey, followed by a 33-yard rush from Hart, pushing Michigan to the four-yard line of Appalachian State. Hart then ran the ball in for a touchdown, and the ensuing extra point made the score 7–0. Appalachian State's CoCo Hillary took the kickoff to the 26-yard line of the Mountaineers. After the Mountaineers opened with a run for no gain and a six-yard completion, Armanti Edwards completed a 68-yard touchdown pass to <a href="Dexter%20Jackson%20%28wide%20receiver%29">Dexter Jackson</a>. The extra point was converted, tying the score at 7–7. The following two drives resulted in <a href="three-and-out">three-and-out</a>s for both teams, but after a Mountaineer punt went out of bounds at the Michigan 48-yard line, the Wolverines mounted a ten-play, 52-yard drive culminating in a ten-yard touchdown pass from Henne to <a href="Greg%20Mathews%20%28American%20football%29">Greg Matthews</a>. The extra point gave Michigan a 14–7 lead. Appalachian State started their drive with 3:09 left in the quarter at their own 35-yard line, completing nine plays and driving to the Michigan 36 yard-line before the end of the quarter.

Following the start of the second quarter, Appalachian State ran another six plays, ending the drive with a nine-yard touchdown pass by Edwards to Hans Batichon. The extra point again evened the score, this time at 14–14. Michigan was forced into a three-and-out and had to punt the ball, with Appalachian State starting their next drive at the Michigan 37. On the fifth play of the next drive, the Mountaineers scored a touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Edwards to Jackson. The Mountaineers converted the extra point attempt, giving them the lead at 21–14. Michigan began their next drive at their 20-yard line, and drove down to the Appalachian State 40-yard line in four plays. Their next play, a <a href="Brandon%20Minor">Brandon Minor</a> run for five yards, was followed by a Minor run for no yards and an incomplete pass. The Wolverines opted to go for it on fourth down but failed to convert, turning the ball over to Appalachian State. The following Mountaineer drive featured nine running plays in a row, the last a six-yard run by Edwards for a touchdown. The extra point was successful, increasing the Mountaineer lead and making the score 28–14. Michigan returned the next kickoff to their 32-yard line, with 2:15 left on the clock. The Wolverines drove to the Appalachian five-yard line, ultimately settling for a field goal with 23 seconds left, cutting Appalachian State's lead to eleven points.

Appalachian State returned the opening kickoff of the second half to their own 36-yard line, but Michigan defender <a href="Morgan%20Trent">Morgan Trent</a> intercepted an Edwards throw on the second play of the drive. Michigan took possession at the Appalachian State 40-yard line, driving to the 25-yard line before kicking a field goal to decrease the Mountaineer lead to eight points. Appalachian State began play after the kickoff at their own 24-yard line, driving 64 yards in 11 plays and scoring a 31-yard field goal to make the score 31–20 Appalachian State. After the ensuing kickoff, Michigan ran four plays before Minor fumbled the ball on the fifth. The fumble was recovered by Appalachian State defender Pierre Banks at the Michigan 28-yard line. However, Appalachian State failed to get a first down on the ensuing drive, and Rauch missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. Michigan went three-and-out on their next drive and had to punt, but a fumble by Edwards on the following Appalachian State drive was recovered by Michigan defender John Thompson, giving them control of the ball at the Appalachian State 31-yard line. Michigan drove 31 yards over six plays, scoring a touchdown on a four-yard run by Hart. The Wolverines went for a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>, but failed to convert, making the score 31–26 in favor of Appalachian State. Appalachian State received the kickoff at their own 26-yard line with 19 seconds left in the third quarter, and the quarter ended following a six-yard completion by Edwards to Batichon.

Appalachian State continued their drive but were forced to punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54 yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69 yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24 yards out with 26 seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of the ball on the ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.

Appalachian State recorded 227 yards through the air, while Michigan finished with 233 yards. Michigan finished with significantly more rushing yards, recording 246 rushing yards as opposed to the 160 rushing yards gained by Appalachian State. In total, the Wolverines recorded 479 total yards of offense, while Appalachian State recorded 387 total yards. The Wolverines recorded 23 first downs, four more than the Mountaineers, while Appalachian State turned the ball over three times, one more than Michigan. Both teams recorded seven penalties, but Michigan recorded more penalty yards. Appalachian State held the edge in time of possession, holding the ball for 31 minutes and 12 seconds; Michigan held the ball for 28 minutes and 48 seconds.

Appalachian State quarterback Armanti Edwards completed 17 of 23 passes for 227 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions while averaging 9.9 yards per throw. Kevin Richardson led the team in rushing yards, running the ball 24 times for 88 yards, and Edwards was second on the team with 17 rushes for 62 yards and one touchdown. Edwards accounted for all four Mountaineer touchdowns. Dexter Jackson led the team in receiving, catching three passes for 98 yards and two touchdowns; he also had one carry for 19 yards.

Michigan quarterback Chad Henne completed 19 of 37 passes for 233 yards, with an average of 6.3 yards per throw; he threw one touchdown and one interception. Mike Hart, who missed almost two quarters due to a thigh injury, led Michigan in rushing, recording 188 yards and three touchdowns on 23 carries. Greg Matthews led the Wolverines in receiving, accounting for 68 yards and one touchdown on seven catches.

Pierre Banks led the Mountaineers in tackles, recording 12 tackles overall. Banks also recorded the only sack for the Mountaineers and recovered a fumble. Corey Lynch finished second with 11 tackles, as well as blocking a kick. Leonard Love recorded the only interception for the Mountaineers. For Michigan, Shawn Crable led the team with 10 tackles. Crable also forced a fumble and recorded 1.5 sacks. Chris Graham finished with 9 tackles, the second-most on the Wolverines. <a href="Brandent%20Englemon">Brandent Englemon</a> and Morgan Trent each intercepted a pass, while <a href="Tim%20Jamison">Tim Jamison</a>, <a href="Terrance%20Taylor%20%28American%20football%29">Terrance Taylor</a>, and Will Johnson received full or partial credit for sacks.

Appalachian State was unanimously selected as the No. 1 team in the FCS football poll in the week after their victory against Michigan. Although several voters in the AP Poll stated they would like to vote for Appalachian State, the Mountaineers were ineligible to receive votes because the poll was only limited to FBS teams; in response, the AP amended their policy the following week to allow FCS teams to receive votes in the AP Poll. The Mountaineers received 19 points in the week 3 edition of the AP Poll and 5 points in the week 4 edition of the AP Poll. The team also extended their winning streak to 17 games before losing to <a href="Wofford%20Terriers%20football">Wofford</a> in week 5. Appalachian State lost to rival <a href="Georgia%20Southern%20Eagles%20football">Georgia Southern</a> in week 7, dropping them to 5–2 and 2–2 in the <a href="Southern%20Conference">Southern Conference</a> (SoCon), which placed them in a poor position to repeat for a third consecutive time as conference champions. However, the Mountaineers won all of their remaining regular season games to finish 9–2, and their 5–2 Southern Conference record was good enough to earn a share of the SoCon conference title with Wofford, but Wofford claimed the conference's automatic bid. As an at-large bid, the team scored a close win over <a href="James%20Madison%20Dukes%20football">James Madison</a> (28–27) and then defeated <a href="Eastern%20Washington%20Eagles%20football">Eastern Washington</a> (38–35) in the first two rounds of the FCS playoffs, Appalachian State easily defeated <a href="Richmond%20Spiders%20football">Richmond</a> (55–35) in the semifinals and <a href="Delaware%20Fighting%20Blue%20Hens">Delaware</a> (49–21) in the championship game, winning their third consecutive FCS National Championship. They became the first team to win three consecutive FCS titles, and the first Division I football team to win three consecutive titles since <a href="Army%20Black%20Knights%20football">Army</a>, who had won three straight titles from 1944 to 1946. At the end of the season, the Mountaineers became the first FCS team to receive votes in the final AP Poll. They received five votes, which placed Appalachian State at a tie for 34th overall with <a href="South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football">South Florida</a>.

Michigan's loss to Appalachian State effectively ended their chances of winning a national championship. The Wolverines dropped out of the top 25 entirely on the AP Poll the following week, the first time a team had missed the top 25 in the AP Poll the week after they were in the top 10. In their next game, Michigan lost to <a href="Oregon%20Ducks%20football">Oregon</a> 39–7, the largest margin of defeat for Michigan since 1968. Following the loss to Oregon, Michigan won their next eight games, leading the team to rank as high as No. 13 in the AP Poll. After Michigan lost their final two games, ending the regular season with an 8–4 record, they dropped off the poll entirely. After Michigan's season-ending loss to Ohio State, Carr announced he would retire as the team's coach after their bowl game. The Wolverines received an invitation to the <a href="2008%20Capital%20One%20Bowl">Capital One Bowl</a>, where they defeated <a href="Florida%20Gators%20football">Florida</a> 41–35 to finish their season 9–4. Following their win in the Capital One Bowl, Michigan finished at No. 18 in the final AP Poll.

Thom Brennaman immediately hailed the game as one of the greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. <a href="Dan%20Wetzel">Dan Wetzel</a> of <a href="Yahoo%21%20Sports">Yahoo! Sports</a> wrote that: "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever "and" a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" writer <a href="Stewart%20Mandel">Stewart Mandel</a> wrote that he felt "utterly unqualified" to put the game into perspective, and said "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." <a href="Pat%20Forde">Pat Forde</a> of ESPN.com called it "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," saying that "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" writer Viv Bernstein called the game "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" and called it "a stunning upset by any measure." The game was the lead story on "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>" and was the cover story for the following week's edition of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>"; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan."

In 2012, Jerry Hinnen of <a href="CBS%20Sports">CBS Sports</a> described it as "the biggest upset of the past five years of college football", and described it as having "set the table" for an "epically chaotic" <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007</a> season as well as "four years' worth of headline-making upsets to follow." Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports said in 2012 that "we may never see its likes again." He said that the game "reminded us why the college game is the best," but felt that such a result would become more unlikely in the future, as many conferences are moving to increase to nine conference games, reducing the need to play FCS teams.

Since Appalachian State's victory, three other FCS teams have defeated ranked FBS teams. In 2010, <a href="2010%20James%20Madison%20Dukes%20football%20team">James Madison</a> defeated 13th-ranked <a href="2010%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech</a> 21–16. In 2013, <a href="2013%20Eastern%20Washington%20Eagles%20football%20team">Eastern Washington</a> beat 25th-ranked <a href="2013%20Oregon%20State%20Beavers%20football%20team">Oregon State</a>, 49–46. The year also saw <a href="2013%20North%20Dakota%20State%20Bison%20football%20team">North Dakota State</a> record a 24–21 victory over <a href="2013%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team">Kansas State</a>, the defending <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12</a> champions. On September 17, 2016, <a href="2016%20North%20Dakota%20State%20Bison%20football%20team">North Dakota State</a> defeated #13 <a href="2016%20Iowa%20Hawkeyes%20football%20team">Iowa</a> 23–21 in a game played in <a href="Kinnick%20Stadium">Iowa City, Iowa</a>.

Just minutes after the game ended, Appalachian State students began celebrating on the two main streets in <a href="Boone%2C%20North%20Carolina">Boone, North Carolina</a>: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to <a href="Kidd%20Brewer%20Stadium">Kidd Brewer Stadium</a>, Appalachian State's home field, and tore down one of the goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He was fine with this, saying "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait to get there and see it." Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00 p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20 minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was "flooded" with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.

In <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, the reaction was far different. "<a href="The%20Ann%20Arbor%20News">The Ann Arbor News</a>" reported that the Michigan fans who attended the game were "shell-shocked." Appalachian State's win also proved popular among fans of Michigan's rivals. The Associated Press reported that, following the end of Ohio State's 38–6 home victory against <a href="Youngstown%20State%20Penguins%20football">Youngstown State</a>, <a href="Ohio%20Stadium">Ohio Stadium</a> aired the final minutes of the Appalachian State-Michigan game on the stadium's big screen; although most of the fans had already left, the outcome "elicited a large roar" from the remaining attendees. Similarly, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Collegian">The Daily Collegian</a>" reported that as <a href="Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football">Penn State</a> was closing a 59–0 home victory over <a href="FIU%20Panthers%20football">Florida International</a>, the update "Twenty seconds to play fourth quarter, Appalachian State 34, Michigan 32" was announced over the stadium's loudspeak. The <a href="student%20section">student section</a> and several Penn State players quickly crowded inside of <a href="Beaver%20Stadium">Beaver Stadium</a> to watch the closing seconds on in-stadium televisions; when the game-winning kick was blocked, they "converged into a <a href="mosh%20pit">mosh pit</a>" in celebration.
The "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" reported that the loudest cheers during <a href="Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football">Michigan State</a>'s home victory against <a href="UAB%20Blazers%20football">UAB</a> came when the scoreboard displayed the final score of the Appalachian State vs. Michigan game; to conclude his postgame press conference, Michigan State defensive coordinator <a href="Pat%20Narduzzi">Pat Narduzzi</a> stated: "And Michigan lost, too." The Ohio State locker room erupted into a "roar" after the players learned of Michigan's loss. Conversely, Michigan State running back <a href="Javon%20Ringer">Javon Ringer</a> expressed disappointment at the game's result, saying "I kinda really wanted [Michigan] to be undefeated for us." Ohio State coach <a href="Jim%20Tressel">Jim Tressel</a> gave a similar reaction, saying that "I'm never glad when a conference opponent loses outside of your game with them... You're always rooting for your brethren in the Big Ten." ESPN.com reported that in the hours after the game, "at least one street vendor was doing brisk business selling freshly minted Mountaineers T-shirts near the Ohio State campus", while stores near the campus were "swamped with requests for gear bearing the Mountaineers' gold and black colors and logo", primarily from Ohio State fans who were rejoicing over their rival's defeat. Appalachian State's campus bookstore received a large number of phone calls from people wanting to buy gear, many of them from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, but were unable to sell them in large quantities due to a state law prohibiting university bookstores from selling items to people who are not students, faculty, or alumni.

In 2011, Appalachian State and Michigan agreed to play a rematch, scheduled for 2014 to be the season-opener for both teams. Appalachian State was paid $850,000 to play this game. Michigan's athletic director, <a href="Dave%20Brandon">Dave Brandon</a>, felt a rematch would be an excellent way to gain attention for Michigan football and said "The networks were fighting over who gets to televise that game." Jerry Moore said that "To have the University of Michigan invite us back is the ultimate compliment for us as a program and a university. We're grateful for the opportunity to have a new generation of players experience a gameday at the Big House and to test themselves against college football's all-time winningest program." Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the <a href="Sun%20Belt%20Conference">Sun Belt Conference</a> as full members. The rematch was much different this time around, with Michigan beating Appalachian State 52–14; Appalachian State never held a lead in the game.

Hotel Chevalier

Hotel Chevalier is an American-French <a href="short%20film">short film</a> written and directed by <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> and released in 2007. Starring <a href="Jason%20Schwartzman">Jason Schwartzman</a> and <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a> as former lovers who reunite in a <a href="Paris">Paris</a> hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a <a href="prologue">prologue</a> to Anderson's 2007 feature "<a href="The%20Darjeeling%20Limited">The Darjeeling Limited</a>". It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a>s in four U.S. cities.

The day after the film's première, it was made freely available from the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered near universal critical acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to "The Darjeeling Limited" and praised its richness, poignancy, and careful construction.

In a hotel lobby, the <a href="concierge">concierge</a> answers a phone call from a guest's room. A man (<a href="Jason%20Schwartzman">Jason Schwartzman</a>) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film "<a href="Stalag%2017">Stalag 17</a>" and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken <a href="French%20language">French</a>, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room – pausing to play the opening bars of the song "<a href="Where%20Do%20You%20Go%20To%20%28My%20Lovely%29%3F">Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?</a>" by <a href="Peter%20Sarstedt">Peter Sarstedt</a> on his stereo system – and runs a bath.
The man is again lying on the bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman (<a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a>). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.
Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly "what the fuck is going on?" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he "will never be [her] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.
The woman is perched against an <a href="armoire">armoire</a>, the man approaches and covers her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.

<a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> first approached Schwartzman and Portman about "Hotel Chevalier" in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on "<a href="Rushmore%20%28film%29">Rushmore</a>" (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, and had been living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment in the months leading up to the shoot. Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from <a href="Scott%20Rudin">Scott Rudin</a>, executive producer of 2004's "<a href="Closer%20%282004%20film%29">Closer</a>" in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.

It was filmed at the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Raphael">Hôtel Raphael</a> in Paris, on <a href="Avenue%20Kl%C3%A9ber">Avenue Kléber</a>, two blocks south-southwest of the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a>. The Hôtel Raphael had previously been used as a setting for the films "<a href="Love%20in%20Paris">Love in Paris</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Place%20Vend%C3%B4me%20%28film%29">Place Vendôme</a>" (1998). It was shot by a crew of 15 in Panavision and used props from Anderson's apartment. Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week. Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer <a href="Marc%20Jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a> and a handmade suitcase from <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>, the director described the production as "like making a student film".

Anderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as "The Darjeeling Limited". "Chevalier" takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in "Darjeeling". The dialogue between the characters at the end of "Chevalier" is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. <a href="Fox%20Searchlight%20Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a>, the studio that backed "Darjeeling", was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.

"Hotel Chevalier" was screened as part of the program at the world première of "The Darjeeling Limited" at the <a href="64th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">64th Venice International Film Festival</a> on September 2, 2007. The short had its own première at <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a>s in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25. Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman appeared at the New York screening in <a href="SoHo">SoHo</a>, after which they held a questions-and-answers session with the audience. The short was made available the following day as a free download from Apple's <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>. On September 28, it preceded the showing of the feature on the opening night of the 2007 <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Festival">New York Film Festival</a>. A press release posted before the première described the short as "the brief coda to a doomed romance and the prologue to "The Darjeeling Limited"".

The film was withdrawn from iTunes after having been available for download for a month. It had been dismissed by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" columnist Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes release as an "<a href="amuse-bouche">amuse-bouche</a>" that was "destined to be a mere footnote". It was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during its run, and received wide acclaim. Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was distributed in theaters as the prologue to the feature-length film. Although "The New York Times" reported in October 2007 that distributor <a href="Fox%20Searchlight%20Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a> intended to promote "Chevalier" as a competitor for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Live%20Action%20Short%20Film">Best Live Action Short Film</a> of the Academy Awards, it was not among that year's nominations. It was included as an extra feature on the "Darjeeling" 2008 DVD release, and Anderson's screenplay for the short was published in the Winter 2007 issue of the literary magazine "".

"Hotel Chevalier" was one of the year's most discussed short films, and attracted considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to "<a href="The%20Darjeeling%20Limited">The Darjeeling Limited</a>". Gary Susman of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" described it as "an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters", adding that ""Chevalier" sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here." <a href="Armond%20White">Armond White</a> of "<a href="New%20York%20Press">New York Press</a>" judged the short "moving and genuinely contemporary", citing its "lost-girl poignancy". The film drew some attention for Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body. Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying "[i]t really depressed me that half of every review ... was about the nudity". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.

While "The Darjeeling Limited" did receive generally positive reviews—having attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>—many of the champions of "Hotel Chevalier" tended to combine praise of "Chevalier" with subtle shots at "Darjeeling". Portman's performance was praised by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">TIME</a>" reviewer <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a>, who declared her to be "a comic actress in fresh bloom" in the "beguiling vignette", and expressed his wish that her role in "Darjeeling" had been greater. The feature, he felt, lacked "the feeling and wit of the short film". <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> of "<a href="Salon%20%28magazine%29">Salon</a>" concurred, stating that "the untold story of "Hotel Chevalier" is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in ", and calling the short "very close to perfect". "The Guardian" columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the "genuine ardour" that greeted the "perfectly measured narrative" of "Chevalier". He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work. <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> of "The New York Times" hailed "Chevalier" as "a small gem" in comparison to the "overstuffed suitcase" of the feature, and wrote that "It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry."

Sinestro Corps War

"Sinestro Corps War" is an <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a> <a href="Fictional%20crossover">crossover</a> event published by <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> in its "<a href="Green%20Lantern">Green Lantern</a>" and "<a href="Green%20Lantern%20Corps">Green Lantern Corps</a>" titles. Written by <a href="Geoff%20Johns">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> and drawn by <a href="Ivan%20Reis">Ivan Reis</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Gleason%20%28artist%29">Patrick Gleason</a>, and <a href="Ethan%20Van%20Sciver">Ethan Van Sciver</a>, the 11-part saga was originally published between June and December <a href="2007%20in%20comics">2007</a>. In addition to the main storyline, four supplemental "Tales of the Sinestro Corps" one-shot specials and a "<a href="Blue%20Beetle">Blue Beetle</a>" tie-in issue were concurrently released.

The story centers on the Green Lanterns of Earth—<a href="Hal%20Jordan">Hal Jordan</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Rayner">Kyle Rayner</a>, <a href="John%20Stewart%20%28comics%29">John Stewart</a> and <a href="Guy%20Gardner%20%28comics%29">Guy Gardner</a>—and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps as they fight an interstellar war against the <a href="Sinestro%20Corps">Sinestro Corps</a>, an army led by the former Green Lantern <a href="Sinestro">Sinestro</a> who are armed with yellow power rings and seek a universe ruled through fear. A 1986 <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> "Tales of the Green Lantern Corps" story was the thematic basis of the storyline. Many characters were changed, killed off, or re-introduced as a result of the event.

Critical and fan reception to "Sinestro Corps War" was highly positive. Many reviewers ranked it among the top comic books of the year and the storyline's first issue garnered a 2008 <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a> nomination for Best Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. The storyline was also a financial success, and several issues underwent multiple printings. "Sinestro Corps War" is the second part of a trilogy in the Green Lantern storyline, preceded by the 2005 miniseries "". The conclusion of "Sinestro Corps War" sets up the third and final part of the trilogy, "<a href="Blackest%20Night">Blackest Night</a>", which was published in 2009.

Following his defeat in "", the events of "Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special" #1 see the supervillain <a href="Sinestro">Sinestro</a> retreat to the planet <a href="Qward">Qward</a> in the Antimatter Universe. There he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to "instill great fear". Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the <a href="Green%20Lantern%20Corps">Green Lantern Corps</a>. Amongst Sinestro's allies are <a href="Parallax%20%28comics%29">Parallax</a> and the resurrected <a href="Anti-Monitor">Anti-Monitor</a>. The <a href="Sinestro%20Corps">Sinestro Corps</a> then launch an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself.

During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free <a href="Superman-Prime">Superman-Prime</a> and the <a href="Hank%20Henshaw">Cyborg Superman</a> from their imprisonment. <a href="Kyle%20Rayner">Kyle Rayner</a> is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the <a href="symbiosis">symbiote</a> <a href="Ion%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Ion</a> allowing Parallax to possess him. In "Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #21 the heroes <a href="Hal%20Jordan">Hal Jordan</a>, <a href="John%20Stewart%20%28comics%29">John Stewart</a> and <a href="Guy%20Gardner%20%28comics%29">Guy Gardner</a> attempt to rescue fallen comrade Kyle Rayner, but are themselves entrapped, with Jordan transported to face Sinestro and his allies. A failed bid to rescue Jordan depicted in "Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #22 sees surviving members of the Green Lantern Corps forced underground and split into two groups. While one group attempts to free Jordan only to find themselves ambushed, the other successfully rescues Ion. They then re-unite with their ambushed comrades and together they escape from Qward back to the positive matter universe. Hal, John and Guy return to Earth to warn the <a href="Justice%20League%20of%20America">Justice League</a> of the Anti-Monitor's return.

As the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, "Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #23 sees the <a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20Universe">Guardians</a> decide to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They remove a section devoted to a prophecy concerning the "Blackest Night," against the objections of two of their number, <a href="Ganthet">Ganthet</a> and <a href="Sayd">Sayd</a>. They then add ten new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps, while Ganthet and Sayd are expelled from Oa. As the Green Lanterns gather on Oa in preparation for a Sinestro Corps assault, the Sinestro Corps teleport themselves and their Central Power Battery instead to a new <a href="Warworld">Warworld</a>, their objective revealed to be Earth. Events in "Green Lantern Corps" (vol. 2) #16 show Hal informing the Green Lantern Corps of Sinestro's plans.

"Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #24 continues the story, with Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members battling across Earth. Hal manages to free Kyle from Parallax before the entity is imprisoned in their power batteries by Ganthet and Sayd. After John and Guy arrive, the former Guardians reveal to them the prophecy of the "Blackest Night," seen in "Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #25. It foretells of five more Corps arising, each based on a different color and emotion. After the five corps are established, a "War of Light" will ensue, in which all the corps are destroyed, leading to the "Blackest Night."

The Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe and another, <a href="Scar%20%28comics%29">Scar</a>, suffers a major wound at the hands of the Anti-Monitor, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. It is learned 440 Green Lanterns perished during the course of the war.

As seen in "Green Lantern" (vol. 4) #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into effect. After realizing that the "Blackest Night" prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own corps, based on the spreading of <a href="hope">hope</a> to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor's remains, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle's climax, lands on a dark planet where it is transformed by an <a href="Nekron">unknown force</a> into a black power battery.

"Sinestro Corps War" was based on concepts introduced by <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="Kevin%20O%27Neill%20%28comics%29">Kevin O'Neill</a> in the short story "Tygers", published in "Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual" #2 (1986). Writers <a href="Geoff%20Johns">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> incorporated several ideas from Moore's stories into "Sinestro Corps War", including the prophecy of the Blackest Night, <a href="Sodam%20Yat">Sodam Yat</a>, <a href="Ranx%20the%20Sentient%20City">Ranx the Sentient City</a> and the Children of the White Lobe. Leezle Pon, a minor character only mentioned once in Moore's "Mogo Doesn't Socialize" story from 25 years previous, also makes an appearance in "Green Lantern" #25.

Work began on "Sinestro Corps War" in September 2006. The structure was fluid, at one point becoming a few issues with two bookends to just one gigantic issue. The title was originally just "Sinestro Corps", but during development the creators added the word "War". Eventually the structure finalized into a one-shot special for release in June, after which the story would alternate between "Green Lantern" and "Green Lantern Corps" until November. After the crossover's initial publishing successes, DC added four "Tales of the Sinestro Corps" one-shots to the publishing schedule.

Johns and Ethan Van Sciver first announced the crossover during the DC "Big Guns" panel at the 2006 <a href="Fan%20Expo%20Canada">Fan Expo Canada</a>, with Johns calling it "the next level of """. By January 2007, Johns, Gibbons and editor <a href="Peter%20Tomasi">Peter Tomasi</a> had planned out most of the storyline. Sterling Gates, whom Johns had met at a convention, was brought in to write a backup story for the Superman-Prime one-shot and co-write "Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files" #1.

The creators called "Sinestro Corps War" "<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> with the entire universe". In a September 2007 interview, Johns compared "Sinestro Corps War" to the <a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a> trilogy, with "" as "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">A New Hope</a>" and "Sinestro Corps War" as "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>". References to other science fiction stories were made by artist Ivan Reis, who inserted characters such as <a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T.</a>, <a href="ALF%20%28TV%20series%29">ALF</a> and a <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predator</a> into large two-page illustrations. The writers also included the sound "EPA" in "Green Lantern" #25 as a direct reference to a scene in "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a>" where <a href="Comic%20Book%20Guy">Comic Book Guy</a> says it is the sound <a href="Hal%20Jordan">Green Lantern</a> made when <a href="Sinestro">Sinestro</a> threw him in a vat of acid.

The main story consisted of 11 parts running through the "Green Lantern" and "Green Lantern Corps" books. Expanding upon the overall story are four one-shots labeled "Tales of the Sinestro Corps", as well as one tie-in with "<a href="Blue%20Beetle%20%28Jaime%20Reyes%29">Blue Beetle</a>" #20. Part One, the one-shot "Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special" #1, was released in June 2007. Parts Two through Ten were released between August and December, alternating between "Green Lantern" #21–25 and "Green Lantern Corps" #14–18, with an epilogue in "Green Lantern" #26. The content of "Green Lantern Corps" #19 was changed to illustrate the battle between Sodam Yat and Superman-Prime in response to the fans' reaction to the story. Geoff Johns announced in October 2007 that the conclusion "Green Lantern" #25 would be delayed two weeks. After the storyline concluded, "Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps <a href="Secret%20Files%20and%20Origins">Secret Files and Origins</a>" #1 was released in December. The issue further explored the back story of the opposing groups and listed every member of the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps.
There was much internal discussion at DC about how the storyline would be collected. Eventually DC decided to release two hardcover volumes (a February 2008 release containing the first five parts of the story and a June 2008 release containing the last six issues) and a June 2008 hardcover collecting the tie-in issues and backstories. This follows DC Comics' recent trend of releasing durable hardcover collections initially, followed later by softcovers.

In addition to the main story, DC released four "Tales of the Sinestro Corps" one-shots in September, October and November 2007. The issues were late additions to the crossover that DC added after the initial successes of "Sinestro Corps War". A hardcover collection of the four issues was released in June 2008. The "Tales of the Sinestro Corps" one-shots focused on:

"Sinestro Corps War" introduced the <a href="Sinestro%20Corps">Sinestro Corps</a> in full after allusions to them throughout the post-<a href="One%20Year%20Later">One Year Later</a> "Green Lantern" title. <a href="Sinestro">Sinestro</a> received a major thematic overhaul as a result of his leadership of his eponymous Corps, with parallels drawn with <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Green Lantern villains Superboy-Prime (later Superman-Prime), Cyborg Superman, and the Manhunters became members of the Sinestro Corps. The Anti-Monitor also made his first reappearance since his death at the conclusion of "<a href="Crisis%20on%20Infinite%20Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" in 1985 as the "Guardian" of the Sinestro Corps and later the power source of the Black Lanterns. Superboy-Prime was renamed Superman-Prime during the event. Ostensibly to illustrate his coming of age in the story, Geoff Johns cited the ongoing <a href="Superboy%23Legal%20status">legal dispute over the Superboy name</a> as another reason for the character's new name.

Some changes were also made to the heroes during the course of the storyline. The role of <a href="Ion%20%28comics%29">Ion</a> passed from <a href="Kyle%20Rayner">Kyle Rayner</a> to <a href="Sodam%20Yat">Sodam Yat</a>, making Yat the "strongest Green Lantern in the universe" as a result according to Johns. The Book of Oa was rewritten by the Guardians to institute 10 new laws for the Green Lantern Corps, the first of which authorized lethal force against the Sinestro Corps. The rebirth of <a href="Coast%20City">Coast City</a>, the process of which had been seen throughout Geoff Johns' run on "Green Lantern", as "the City Without Fear" was used to symbolically represent Hal Jordan's journey towards acceptance after his resurrection. The second volume of the story's collection revealed that the original plan was for both John Stewart and Guy Gardner to be possessed by Parallax, with artwork of them facing off against Hal Jordan. However, in the midst of the story planning, Johns realized this would make Parallax's possession of Kyle less effective and the segment was dropped and redrawn.

"Green Lantern" #25 expanded on the "emotional spectrum" concept and introduced five new color-based corps of similar structure to the Green Lanterns and the Sinestro Corps. These corps each draw from different emotions, corresponding with the seven colors of the <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a> (red for rage, orange for avarice, yellow for fear, green for willpower, blue for hope, indigo for compassion and violet for love). <a href="Ganthet">Ganthet</a> and Sayd, two <a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20Universe">Guardians of the Universe</a> who were exiled during the course of the war, were shown as developing the corps that corresponds to the color blue and the emotion hope, while the Anti-Monitor becomes the power source for an eighth color-based corps, the "Black Lanterns," who represent death and the "absence of human drives and emotions." The issue also laid the foundations for the 2009 event "<a href="Blackest%20Night">Blackest Night</a>", something the creators had been working towards since early 2007.

Altogether, "Sinestro Corps War" turned "Green Lantern" into one of DC Comics' most profitable titles. "Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special" #1, first released June 2007, sold out in a single day. DC later reprinted the issue four times, each time with new variant covers by Van Sciver. By August, the issue had sold over 89,000 copies, 36% of which was the result of an unusually high number of reorders. The first four parts of the storyline, "Green Lantern" #21 and 22, and "Green Lantern Corps" #14 and 15, were released in July and August and also sold out. The issues went to a second printing, with "Green Lantern Corps" #14 going to a third printing. "Green Lantern" #23 and "Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Parallax" #1 later went on to second printings as well. "Blue Beetle" #20 saw much higher sales than usual for the title as a result of its tie-in to "Sinestro Corps War", with sales 75% higher than in the previous month.

Critical reception to "Sinestro Corps War" was highly positive. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>.com called the story a "smash hit" and "<a href="Newsarama">Newsarama</a>" referred to it as both an "action-packed DC adventure" and "DC's blockbuster event of the year". <a href="Comic%20Book%20Resources">Comic Book Resources</a> released an editorial in mid-October 2007 entitled "Sinestro Corps War is what <a href="World%20War%20Hulk">World War Hulk</a> SHOULD be", citing the former's ability to keep up and gain momentum throughout despite being both twice as large and far less publicized than the latter. Comic Book Resources placed "Sinestro Corps War" on its "Best of 2007" list, and named Geoff Johns one of its "Best Writers of 2007". In 2008, Ethan Van Sciver earned an <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a> nomination for his art in "Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special" #1.

DC Comics Executive Editor <a href="Dan%20DiDio">Dan DiDio</a> praised the storyline as "the best thing that <nowiki>[DC Comics]</nowiki> put out this year. Without a doubt", and called "Sinestro Corps War" the model for crossovers in 2008 and beyond, including "<a href="Final%20Crisis">Final Crisis</a>". Didio has also stated that he would like to see a direct-to-video animated "Sinestro Corps War" film similar to "". Geoff Johns suggested elements of "Sinestro Corps War" will appear in "<a href="DC%20Universe%20Online">DC Universe Online</a>", on which he is collaborating with artist <a href="Jim%20Lee">Jim Lee</a>.

The main story was first collected in two <a href="Trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">volumes</a>, but was later collected in a single volume. Miscellaneous stories were collected in an additional volume:

Andrew Sledd

Andrew Warren Sledd (November 7, 1870 – March 16, 1939) was an American <a href="Christian%20theology">theologian</a>, university professor and university president. A native of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, he was the son of a prominent <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a>, and was himself <a href="ordination">ordained</a> as a minister after earning his bachelor's and master's degrees. He later earned a second master's degree and his <a href="doctorate">doctorate</a>.

After teaching for several years, Sledd was chosen to be the last president of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida at Lake City</a>, from 1904 to 1905, and the first president of the modern <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> (first known as the "University of the State of Florida"), from 1905 to 1909. He was also president of <a href="Birmingham-Southern%20College">Southern University</a> from 1910 to 1914, and later became a professor and an influential <a href="Biblical%20studies">biblical scholar</a> at <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>'s <a href="Candler%20School%20of%20Theology">Candler School of Theology</a> from 1914 to 1939.

Sledd first gained national recognition after he wrote a 1902 magazine article advocating better legal and social treatment of <a href="African-American">African-American</a>s. He is also prominently remembered for his role in founding the modern University of Florida, his scholarly analysis of biblical texts as literature, his call for an end to racial violence, and his influence on a generation of Methodist <a href="seminary">seminary</a> students, scholars and ministers.

Sledd was born November 7, 1870, in <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>, the son of a <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal</a> minister, Robert Newton Sledd, and his wife, Frances Carey Greene Sledd. The elder Sledd was an influential minister within the <a href="Annual%20Conferences%20of%20the%20United%20Methodist%20Church%23Annual%20Conferences%20in%20the%20Jurisdiction%20Conference%20%28Inside%20the%20U.S.%29">Virginia Methodist Conference</a>, and at various times while Andrew was growing up, his father held prominent <a href="pastor">pastor</a>ates of large Methodist congregations in four different Virginia cities—<a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville</a>, <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>, <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg</a> and <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. Andrew received his early education in the Petersburg school of W. Gordon McCabe, a former <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> and veteran of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">U.S. Civil War</a>.

In 1888, Sledd entered Methodist-affiliated <a href="Randolph%E2%80%93Macon%20College">Randolph–Macon College</a> in Ashland, Virginia. While at Randolph–Macon, he was a member of <a href="Phi%20Delta%20Theta">Phi Delta Theta</a> <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities">Fraternity</a> (<a href="List%20of%20Phi%20Delta%20Theta%20chapters">Virginia Gamma</a> chapter); he was also the college's outstanding student-athlete and was particularly known as the <a href="college%20baseball">baseball</a> team's <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> and star hitter. Sledd left the college without finishing his undergraduate degree requirements, first accepting a position as a teacher in <a href="Durant%2C%20Mississippi">Durant, Mississippi</a>, and then as the <a href="principal%20%28education%29">principal</a> of a high school in <a href="Arkadelphia%2C%20Arkansas">Arkadelphia, Arkansas</a>. After teaching in Arkansas for two years, he returned to Randolph–Macon and completed his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> degrees in 1894. Sledd graduated in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, was recognized for completing the best work in the mathematics and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> departments during his senior year, and was honored as a member of <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>.

Sledd taught at the <a href="Randolph-Macon%20Academy">Randolph-Macon Academy</a> in Front Royal, Virginia, from 1894 to 1895, before returning to graduate school. He earned a second Master of Arts degree in Greek from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1896, and completed one year's additional graduate work toward a doctoral degree. While he was at Harvard, he played for the <a href="Harvard%20Crimson">Harvard Crimson</a> baseball team, and he is remembered as one of Harvard's greatest athletes of the era; he was offered a professional baseball contract but turned it down. Several years later, during a break in his teaching career, Sledd completed his doctorate.

After completing his graduate studies at Harvard, Sledd briefly served as a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> instructor at <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a> in Nashville, Tennessee. He was ordained as a Methodist minister and licensed to preach in 1898. At the suggestion of his father, he contacted Methodist minister <a href="Warren%20Akin%20Candler">Warren Akin Candler</a>, then president of <a href="Oxford%20College%20of%20Emory%20University">Emory College</a> in Oxford, Georgia, who was a prominent leader of the <a href="Annual%20Conferences%20of%20the%20United%20Methodist%20Church%23Annual%20Conferences%20in%20the%20Jurisdiction%20Conference%20%28Inside%20the%20U.S.%29">Georgia Methodist Conference</a> and was a few months from being elevated as a Methodist bishop. Candler was impressed with the character and academic credentials of the young scholar, and assisted him in becoming a professor of Latin language and literature at Emory College, a position Sledd held from 1898 to 1902. While living in the Candler family home, Sledd fell in love with the bishop's only daughter, Annie Florence Candler, and he married her on March 22, 1899; his father conducted the wedding ceremony.

Later in 1899, while traveling by train between <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="Covington%2C%20Georgia">Covington, Georgia</a>, Sledd witnessed the aftermath of the <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynching</a> of an African-American man named <a href="Sam%20Hose">Sam Hose</a>. The idealistic young minister was outraged. In reaction, he wrote an essay entitled "The Negro: Another View," which was published as an article in the July 1902 issue of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic Monthly</a>". In the article, Sledd denounced the lynchings of black men in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> in graphic terms: "lynching is not 'justice,' however rude; it is a wild and diabolic carnival of blood." While he flatly asserted that the "negro race" was not the equal of the "white race," he nevertheless demanded equal justice for blacks and whites alike, writing "There is nothing in a white skin or a black to nullify the essential rights of man as man." Even though Sledd's essay condoned the continued <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a> of white and black Southerners as a necessary social expedient, a public firestorm ensued in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%29">Georgia</a> over Sledd's criticism of the South's treatment of its black citizens, with the controversy stoked by the vitriolic letters and editorial attacks of agrarian <a href="populism">populist</a> <a href="Rebecca%20Felton">Rebecca Felton</a> in "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Constitution</a>" newspaper. As the controversy grew, "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal</a>" and "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Georgian">Atlanta News</a>" quickly joined the anti-Sledd chorus. When a majority of the members of Emory's <a href="board%20of%20trustees">board of trustees</a> threatened to withdraw their support of the college because of the negative publicity, the newly installed college president, <a href="James%20Edward%20Dickey">James E. Dickey</a>, demanded Sledd's resignation from the faculty, and Sledd resigned on August 9, 1902. The Sledd Affair subsequently attracted attention throughout the United States as a matter of academic freedom and freedom of speech.

After resigning from the Emory College faculty, Sledd entered the graduate school of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in New Haven, Connecticut, where he began work in the advanced classics doctoral program, specializing in Latin. Sledd received $1,000 in severance pay from Emory pursuant to an agreement with Dickey and unanimously approved by the Emory faculty, and his father-in-law contributed $900 to help cover his tuition and living expenses while he attended Yale. He received a scholarship from the university, and earned his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree in Latin from Yale in 1903, after only nine months. <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> and <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> offered him professorships in Latin; <a href="Antioch%20College">Antioch College</a> offered him its presidency. Sledd declined all offers from Northern and Western institutions, and was determined to return to his native South.

After completing his doctorate, Sledd obtained an appointment as a professor of Greek at Methodist-affiliated <a href="Birmingham-Southern%20College">Southern University</a> (now known as Birmingham–Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama. Several months later, on July 6, 1904, he was unanimously selected to be the president of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida at Lake City</a> by its board of trustees. At the time of his appointment, the University of Florida at Lake City was experiencing a controversy of its own: its administration and faculty were hopelessly fractured by personality conflicts and its unpopular president's failed attempts at improving the small school's instruction and academic standing. The university's board of trustees had removed the ineffectual president, and dismissed seven members of its small faculty. The university, such as it was, had been known as "Florida Agricultural College" until 1903. When Sledd arrived in <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Florida">Lake City</a>, it was a school with a new name, a faculty fractured by contentious personalities, an unknown number of returning students and an uncertain future. Sledd required all previous faculty members to re-apply if they desired to keep their jobs, hired replacement instructors, most of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their respective fields (in contrast to the previous faculty), and set about devising rigorous academic standards for the school's new students. Although the university was a designated <a href="land-grant%20college">land-grant college</a> under the federal government's <a href="Morrill%20Act">Morrill Act</a>, it received insufficient annual financial assistance from the state government, and its finances remained tenuous.

Sledd and members of the faculty were actively involved in urging Florida's state government to combine the state's several small institutions of higher education. The university consolidation movement gained the political backing of newly elected Florida Governor <a href="Napoleon%20B.%20Broward">Napoleon B. Broward</a>, and in 1905 the <a href="Florida%20Legislature">Florida Legislature</a> passed the <a href="History%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Florida">Buckman Act</a>, which abolished the hodge-podge of state-supported colleges and consolidated their assets and programs into a new comprehensive <a href="university">university</a> and land-grant college for white men, and a <a href="liberal%20arts%20college">liberal arts college</a> and <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a> for white women. The Act mandated the merger of four separate institutions, including the existing University of Florida at Lake City, into the consolidated men's university—the new University of the State of Florida. By a vote of six to four, the new <a href="Florida%20Board%20of%20Control">Board of Control</a> charged with the governance of the consolidated institutions selected Gainesville as the location for the new men's state university.

Sledd had not anticipated that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed that it would be selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City was just one of the four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. <a href="Albert%20A.%20Murphree">Albert A. Murphree</a>, president of <a href="History%20of%20Florida%20State%20University">Florida State College</a> in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.

Sledd nominated all of the original faculty members, a majority of whom he had previously selected to be professors at the University of Florida at Lake City. The new University of the State of Florida operated in Lake City during the first academic year of its existence (1905–06), while the buildings of the new Gainesville campus were being erected. Sledd managed the move of the school's assets from Lake City to Gainesville during the late summer of 1906, and participated in the official dedication of the campus on September 27, 1906. When registration for classes was held in Gainesville on September 24, 1906, there were 102 students and fewer than a dozen faculty members. Sledd received a $2,250 annual salary in his first year as the head of the new state university and, together with his wife and their young children, moved into the still incomplete <a href="Buckman%20Hall%20%28Gainesville%2C%20Florida%29">Buckman Hall</a> dormitory on the Gainesville campus.

Sledd played a key role in the formation and ultimate success of the new university, but his time as its president was a relatively short four years. His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor <a href="Albert%20Gilchrist">Albert Gilchrist</a> in January 1909. The <a href="Florida%20Board%20of%20Education">Florida Board of Education</a>, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected <a href="cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> members, oversaw the Board of Control and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of the Board of Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, the Board of Control continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and the Board of Control replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and the Board of Education.

Following Sledd's resignation, he and his family returned to Atlanta and stayed in the home of his wife's parents. Within a few weeks, he was appointed minister of the First Methodist Church in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, a position he held for the remainder of 1909 and the first half of 1910. Sledd was subsequently invited to return to Southern University as its president, serving from 1910 to 1914. While president of Southern University, he implemented a new pre-college preparatory school and a four-year course of Bible study, and focused his personal efforts on restoring the school's finances and improving the quality of its instruction.

In the fall of 1914, Sledd resigned the presidency of Southern University and returned to Emory College, by then renamed <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a> and relocated to its new main campus in northeast Atlanta, as the first Professor of Greek and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> Literature at the Candler School of Theology, the newly established seminary of the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20South">Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>. Sledd became well known as a professor of Greek, Latin and New Testament studies at Candler, and was the author of several scholarly books on New Testament subjects, including "<a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Saint Mark</a>'s Life of Jesus" (1927), "The Bibles of the Churches" (1930) and "His Witnesses: A Study of the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Book of Acts</a>" (1935). He was selected to be a member of the American Standard Bible Committee, which was preparing <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">a revision</a> of the <a href="American%20Standard%20Version">American Standard Version</a> of the Bible. He continued to advocate internal Methodist reform and an end to racial violence, and his teaching inspired a generation of his Candler theology students to act as change agents within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Many of his former students became Methodist ministers who returned to their congregations and annual conferences to work for better treatment of African-Americans, helping the Southern Methodist church to evolve from a mainstay of theological and racial intransigence to an agent for social change and doctrinal reform.

Sledd's interest in education was not limited to the higher education of colleges and universities. While holding his Candler professorship, he served as a member of the <a href="DeKalb%20County%20School%20System">Board of Public Instruction</a> of <a href="DeKalb%20County%2C%20Georgia">DeKalb County, Georgia</a>, and volunteered to serve as the board's treasurer.

Sledd and his wife Annie also suffered a personal tragedy during his time as a Candler professor, when their first-born son and his namesake, Andrew Sledd Jr., died after an extended illness in 1919. Andrew Jr. was 16 years old, and had graduated from <a href="Decatur%20High%20School%20%28Georgia%29">Decatur High School</a> only weeks earlier.

Sledd became a recognized New Testament scholar and a significant voice of educational, social and ecclesiastical reform within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. For nearly twenty-five years, he remained a professor at Emory University's Candler School of Theology, until his death from a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> on March 16, 1939. Following Sledd's funeral, his body was buried in the <a href="Decatur%20Cemetery">Decatur Cemetery</a>.

In his 1960 "History of Methodism in Alabama and West Florida", Marion Elias Lazenby remembered Sledd as "one of the [Methodist] Church's most scholarly and reverent teachers." Immediately after his death, Sledd was widely <a href="eulogy">eulogized</a> in Methodist churches across the country, and numerous obituaries appeared in regional and national newspapers across the country. "The Atlanta Constitution", whose editorials had vilified Sledd in 1902, paid tribute to him in its obituary as a "nationally known Bible authority"; no mention was made of the "Sledd Affair."

Sledd's advocacy of social change and an evolving understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to <a href="foreclosure">foreclosure</a> after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a <a href="deficiency%20judgment">deficiency judgment</a> for the unpaid portion of his debt after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale of some of his furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.

The faculty of the University of Florida awarded Sledd the university's first <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a>, a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Divinity">Doctor of Divinity</a>, at the spring 1909 commencement ceremonies. In 1933, <a href="John%20J.%20Tigert">John J. Tigert</a>, the university's third president, invited Professor Sledd to be the university's <a href="baccalaureate%20service">baccalaureate speaker</a>. After his death, the university honored him again, renaming one of its early residence halls as <a href="Sledd%20Hall">Sledd Hall</a> in 1939. The small state university, which Sledd had been instrumental in creating and organizing, is now one of the ten <a href="List%20of%20largest%20United%20States%20university%20campuses%20by%20enrollment">largest single-campus universities</a> in the United States, with a total enrollment of nearly 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students.

Sledd and his wife Annie had nine children. Eight of their children graduated from Emory, seven with Phi Beta Kappa honors, a fact newsworthy enough to be picked up by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> wire service when youngest daughter Antoinette graduated from Emory the year following Sledd's death. Two of their sons followed in their father's footsteps, earning doctorates and becoming university professors: James H. Sledd became a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholar">Rhodes Scholar</a> and noted professor of English literature at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Texas">University of Texas</a>; Marvin B. Sledd was a professor of mathematics at <a href="Georgia%20Tech">Georgia Tech</a>.

In 2002, after almost a century of ignoring its role in the "Sledd Affair," Emory University sponsored a presentation entitled "Professing Justice: A Symposium on the Civil Rights Legacy of Professor Andrew Sledd." In holding the inter-disciplinary symposium, Emory University acted to "right a wrong committed a century ago by revisiting the 'Sledd affair' and reflecting on its meaning for Emory today."

Dobroslav Jevđević

Dobroslav Jevđević (, ; 28 December 1895 – October 1962) was a <a href="Serbs%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnian Serb</a> politician and self-appointed <a href="Chetnik">Chetnik</a> commander (, војвода) in the <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a> region of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a>-occupied <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Interwar%20period">interwar</a> Chetnik Association and the <a href="Organization%20of%20Yugoslav%20Nationalists">Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists</a>, a <a href="Yugoslav%20National%20Party">Yugoslav National Party</a> member of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Yugoslavia">National Assembly</a>, and a leader of the opposition to <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">King Alexander</a> between 1929 and 1934. The following year, he became the propaganda chief for the Yugoslav government.

Following the Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, he became a Chetnik leader in Herzegovina and joined the Chetnik movement of <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a>. Jevđević <a href="Collaboration%20with%20the%20Axis%20Powers%20during%20World%20War%20II">collaborated</a> with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italians</a> and later the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germans</a> in actions against the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a>. Although Jevđević recognised the authority of Mihailović, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, a number of factors effectively rendered him independent of Mihailović's command, except when he worked closely with <a href="Ilija%20Trifunovi%C4%87-Bir%C4%8Danin">Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin</a>, Mihailović's designated commander in <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, Herzegovina, western <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> and southwestern <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Croatia</a>.

During the joint Italian–Chetnik <a href="Operation%20Alfa">Operation Alfa</a>, Jevđević's Chetniks, along with other Chetnik forces, were responsible for killing between 543 and 2,500 <a href="Bosniak">Bosnian Muslim</a> and <a href="Croats">Catholic</a> civilians in the <a href="Prozor-Rama">Prozor</a> region in October 1942. They also participated in one of the largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, <a href="Case%20White">Case White</a>, in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of the <a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS General</a> <a href="Odilo%20Globocnik">Odilo Globocnik</a> of the <a href="Operational%20Zone%20of%20the%20Adriatic%20Littoral">Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral</a>. Jevđević fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in <a href="Grottaglie">Grottaglie</a>. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevđević moved to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and lived under an assumed name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.

Dobroslav Jevđević was born on 28 December 1895 in the hamlet of Miloševac in <a href="Pra%C4%8Da%20%28Pale-Pra%C4%8Da%29">Prača</a>, near the town of <a href="Rogatica">Rogatica</a>, in the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a>-occupied <a href="Bosnia%20Vilayet">Bosnia Vilayet</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, to Dimitrije and Angela Jevđević (<a href="married%20and%20maiden%20names">"née"</a> Kosorić). Jevđević's father was a <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox</a> priest, and the family was of Montenegrin Serb origin. Jevđević was raised in the Christian faith and attended secondary school in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. There, he joined the revolutionary organisation known as <a href="Young%20Bosnia">Young Bosnia</a> and became a friend of <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a>, the assassin who <a href="Assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">killed</a> <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a> on 28 June 1914. The day of the assassination, Jevđević's father was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police for his connections with the Serb revolutionary organisation "<a href="Narodna%20Odbrana">Narodna Odbrana</a>" (National Defence). He was charged with high treason, sentenced to death by hanging in April 1916 and executed in <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>.

Jevđević was a successful writer and poet in his youth. He studied law at the universities of <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and spoke Serbian, Italian, German and French. Jevđević's political career began in 1918. During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, he was one of the most influential Serb politicians in Bosnia. He was a member of the <a href="Chetniks%20in%20the%20interwar%20period">Chetnik Association</a>, an aggressively Serb-<a href="Chauvinism">chauvinist</a> political movement of over 500,000 members led by <a href="Kosta%20Pe%C4%87anac">Kosta Pećanac</a>. He was also one of the leaders of the <a href="Independent%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Independent Democratic Party of Yugoslavia</a> and headed the movement's military wing, the <a href="ORJUNA">Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists</a>, which terrorised those Serbs in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Croatia who refused to join the party. Jevđević later became a parliamentary candidate of the opposition <a href="Yugoslav%20National%20Party">Yugoslav National Party</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>. He was elected to the Yugoslav Parliament a total of four times, representing the district of Rogatica then <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a>, and was an opposition leader during King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander</a>'s dictatorship of 1929–34. His tendency to cooperate with various Yugoslav political factions earned him the reputation of "being willing to sell himself to any political group in return for personal favours or advancement". In 1935, he was appointed as the Yugoslav government's propaganda chief by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Bogoljub%20Jevti%C4%87">Bogoljub Jevtić</a>. Jevđević approved of the creation of the <a href="Banovina%20of%20Croatia">Banovina of Croatia</a> in 1939 and advocated a large Serb counterpart that would include most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This advocacy drew him close to the various Chetnik associations that existed during the interwar period. In 1941, his cousin, Colonel Dušan Radović, left Yugoslavia and joined the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>.

Jevđević fled to <a href="Budva">Budva</a> on the Montenegrin coast following the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941. That month, the Germans and Italians created a <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a> known as the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (; NDH), which implemented genocidal policies against <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="Romani%20people">Romanis</a>. The Serb population began to resist, and Jevđević became a prominent leader of the Chetnik uprising against NDH authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1941.

He was known for his pro-Italian sympathies prior to the war, and Chetnik leader <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a> jokingly described him as "an Italian who likes Serbs". Jevđević and pre-war Chetnik leader <a href="Ilija%20Trifunovi%C4%87-Bir%C4%8Danin">Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin</a> sought to work with the Italians in the belief that an Italian occupation of both Bosnia and Herzegovina would limit the ability of the NDH to carry out its anti-Serb policies. Jevđević reportedly hoped that the Italians would allow the formation of a Serbian state of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their protection, but they were more interested in obtaining the practical assistance of his Chetniks in fighting the Partisans than helping him achieve his political aims. In the summer of 1941, Jevđević established links with the Italians, promoting Trifunović-Birčanin and himself as civilian intermediaries for the eastern Bosnian Chetniks of <a href="Jezdimir%20Dangi%C4%87">Jezdimir Dangić</a>.

On 20 October 1941, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin met and agreed to collaborate with the head of the information division of the Italian <a href="VI%20Corps%20%28Italy%29">VI Corps</a>. In late January 1942, Jevđević offered to assist the Italians if they occupied Bosnia, and to organise Chetnik detachments to work alongside Italian units in their fight against the <a href="communist">communist</a>-led <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a>. These contacts involved General <a href="Renzo%20Dalmazzo">Renzo Dalmazzo</a>, commander of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik leaders <a href="Stevo%20Ra%C4%91enovi%C4%87">Stevo Rađenović</a>, Trifunović-Birčanin, Dangić and Jevđević. In February, Jevđević consulted with one of Dangić's supporters, <a href="Bo%C5%A1ko%20Todorovi%C4%87">Boško Todorović</a>, who instructed him to negotiate with the new commander of the Italian <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Italy%29">Second Army</a>, <a href="Mario%20Roatta">Mario Roatta</a>, to arrange the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be replaced by an exclusively Italian administration. Both Jevđević and Todorović impressed Dalmazzo with the influence they were able to exert over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, but Todorović was killed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The influence Jevđević had was demonstrated when Serb nationalist armed groups in the <a href="Gora%C5%BEde">Goražde</a> and <a href="Fo%C4%8Da">Foča</a> districts swung over to an anti-Partisan and pro-Italian attitude when they were informed of Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin's ties with VI Corps headquarters. The plans for Italian expansion into eastern Bosnia were later discussed between Jevđević and NDH State Secretary <a href="Vjekoslav%20Vran%C4%8Di%C4%87">Vjekoslav Vrančić</a>.

Dalmazzo urged Roatta to expand Italian links with Serb nationalist groups into an alliance with them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under the impression that the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under the impression that Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around <a href="Nevesinje">Nevesinje</a> ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.

In the spring and summer of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin regularly toured villages in the Goražde, <a href="Kalinovik">Kalinovik</a> and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as <a href="auxiliaries">auxiliaries</a> during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan <a href="Operation%20Trio">Operation Trio</a> in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander <a href="Mom%C4%8Dilo%20%C4%90uji%C4%87">Momčilo Đujić</a> in <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a>, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.

In an internal Chetnik report of June 1942, Jevđević claimed that the Partisan proletarian brigades contained many "Jews, Gypsies and Muslims". In July 1942, he issued a proclamation to the "Serbs of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina" claiming that:

Jevđević charged the Partisans with having "destroyed Serb churches and established <a href="mosque">mosque</a>s, <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s and Catholic temples". In mid-1942, the Chetniks became aware that the Italians were planning to largely withdraw from significant parts of the NDH that they had been occupying in force up to that time. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin told the Italians that in response to this, Mihailović was considering evacuating Serb civilians from Herzegovina to Montenegro and moving Montenegrin Chetniks north to meet the <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>, who were expected to unleash a new wave of violence on Serb civilians. Over 22–23 July 1942, Mihailović chaired a conference with Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin in <a href="Avtovac">Avtovac</a>, Herzegovina. On the second day of the conference, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin traveled to nearby <a href="Trebinje">Trebinje</a> where they conferred with Herzegovinian Chetnik leaders <a href="Radmilo%20Gr%C4%91i%C4%87">Radmilo Grđić</a> and <a href="Milan%20%C5%A0anti%C4%87">Milan Šantić</a>. The German consulate in Sarajevo reported that this meeting established the ultimate goals and immediate strategy of the Herzegovinian Chetniks as:

Under the auspices of the Italians, the Chetniks thoroughly <a href="ethnically%20cleansed">ethnically cleansed</a> eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims in July and August 1942. In response to a massacre of non-Serbs in Foča in August, Jevđević issued a proclamation to the Muslims in eastern Herzegovina demanding that they join the Chetniks in their struggle against the Ustaše. He stated: "I personally believe that in a future state the Muslims have no other choice but to finally and definitely accept Serb nationality and renounce their speculative maneuvering between the Serb and Croat nations, above all because all the lands in which the Muslims live will indisputably and inviolably become part of the Serb state entity." That month, Roatta contacted Jevđević and "legalised" 3,000 of his Chetniks, formally authorising them to operate in eastern Herzegovina.

In the autumn of 1942, Jevđević took a radically different approach than other Chetnik leaders and spoke in favour of collaborating with the Muslims to form Muslim Chetnik units in the fight against the Ustaše and the Partisans. He favoured such tolerance in areas where the Muslims were protected by the Germans, and considered it a tactical necessity while stressing that "there can be no true unity with them". In late September or early October 1942, Jevđević and Chetnik commander <a href="Petar%20Ba%C4%87ovi%C4%87">Petar Baćović</a> held talks with Muslim leader <a href="Ismet%20Popovac">Ismet Popovac</a> and agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik organisation. Jevđević then urged the Italian military to occupy all of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to end Ustaše rule and claimed the support of 80 percent of the population, consisting of Serbs and Muslims. At the same time, he requested that the Germans grant autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the end of the war, citing that the Muslims were "tested friends of the Germans both in the earlier and in the present era". Although Jevđević attempted to recruit Muslims while making use of the Bosnian desire for autonomy to support his alliance with the occupying Axis powers, nothing developed from these requests.

Towards the end of August 1942, Mihailović issued directives to Chetnik units, including those operating in the NDH such as Jevđević's forces, ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops. In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunović-Birčanin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the <a href="Prozor-Rama">Prozor</a>–<a href="Livno">Livno</a> area and offered 7,500 Chetniks as aid on the condition they be given the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action. The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Ustaše leader <a href="Ante%20Paveli%C4%87">Ante Pavelić</a> and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement.

In early October 1942, Jevđević and Baćović, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and southeast Bosnia, participated in the Italian-led <a href="Operation%20Alfa">Operation Alfa</a>. This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the <a href="Neretva">Neretva</a> River. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian–Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area. Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> to aid Đujić's forces. A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović, hoping to distance themselves from the actions of the troops.

In a meeting with Roatta in November 1942, Jevđević obtained Italian agreement to "legalise" another 3,000 Chetniks and recognition of almost all of eastern Herzegovina as a "Chetnik zone". In return, the Chetniks had to promise not to attack Muslim and Croat civilians and agreed to having an Italian liaison officer embedded in all their formations of regiment strength or more. On 15 November 1942, Jevđević agreed to support the Italian decision to start arming Muslim anti-Partisan groups. This support almost cost him his life when several Chetniks, who strongly opposed the arming of Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan groups by the Italians, visited <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a> with the intention of assassinating him.

By the end of 1942, Chetnik–Italian collaboration was routine. Chetnik forces were included in the Italian planning for <a href="Case%20White">Case White</a>, a major Axis anti-Partisan offensive which was to be launched on 20 January 1943. On 3 January, Jevđević participated in an Axis planning conference for Case White in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, along with senior German, Italian and NDH commanders. The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jevđević's command, and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would not cross the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided. Early in the operation, Jevđević concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar. Later in the operation Jevđević requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen</a> in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks.

After the death of Trifunović-Birčanin in February 1943, Jevđević, along with Đujić, Baćović, and <a href="Radovan%20Ivani%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Radovan Ivanišević</a>, vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunović-Birčanin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. The Italians were able to exert pressure on Jevđević, as his brother and fiancée were interned in Italy. Mihailović apparently felt that Jevđević had exceeded his authority by attending the Case White planning conference in Rome, and indeed, when the Yugoslav government-in-exile awarded Jevđević the <a href="Order%20of%20Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e%27s%20Star">Order of Karađorđe's Star</a> in early 1943 for his services to the Serb population during the Ustaše massacres of 1941, Mihailović suppressed the announcement of the award because of the nature of Jevđević's agreement with the Italians, although the reason may also have been because he was aware of Chetnik revenge killings of Herzegovinian Catholics and Muslims in response to atrocities committed by the Ustaše in Croatia. Tensions between Mihailović and Jevđević became so apparent that Mihailović reportedly threatened to "string [him] up from the nearest tree". In March, Jevđević publicly demanded an end to the Chetnik killing of Croats in Herzegovina. In May, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> finally gave in to German pressure and ordered Italian troops to co-operate in the disarming of Chetnik groups. Jevđević was immediately placed under house arrest.

His house arrest did not last long, as in the following month, Mihailović sent Jevđević to Slovenia to report on the state of Chetnik forces there. Jevđević began developing contacts with the Germans prior to the <a href="Armistice%20between%20Italy%20and%20Allied%20armed%20forces">Italian capitulation</a> in September 1943. On 3 September, he travelled to Rome via <a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a> and made contact with German intelligence services. This marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Germans. Following the German occupation of NDH territory that had previously been held by the Italians, Jevđević moved to Trieste and stayed at the Hotel Continental. There, he helped organise displaced Chetniks and arranged for them to be returned to the town of <a href="Opatija">Opatija</a>. He stayed in Trieste until January 1944, when he relocated to Opatija with Chetniks from Trieste who had been placed under his command. He then moved his Chetniks to <a href="Ilirska%20Bistrica">Ilirska Bistrica</a>, and collaborated with the Germans until the end of the war.

In December 1944, Jevđević's 3,000 remaining fighters joined Đujić's Chetniks, <a href="Dimitrije%20Ljoti%C4%87">Dimitrije Ljotić</a>'s <a href="Serbian%20Volunteer%20Corps%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Serbian Volunteer Corps</a>, and the remnants of <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a>'s <a href="Serbian%20State%20Guard">Serbian Shock Corps</a>, which were under the command of "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS</a>" (SS General) <a href="Odilo%20Globocnik">Odilo Globocnik</a>, the <a href="Higher%20SS%20and%20Police%20Leader">Higher SS and Police Leader</a> of the <a href="Operational%20Zone%20of%20the%20Adriatic%20Littoral">Adriatic Littoral</a>. Despite this, they attempted to contact the western <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in Italy in an effort to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. They were all blessed by Serbian Orthodox bishop <a href="Nikolaj%20Velimirovi%C4%87">Nikolaj Velimirović</a> upon his arrival in Slovenia. On 11 April 1945, a detachment of Jevđević's Chetniks, along with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, marched into south-western Croatia with the aim of linking up with the <a href="Montenegrin%20Volunteer%20Corps">Montenegrin Volunteer Corps</a> of <a href="Pavle%20%C4%90uri%C5%A1i%C4%87">Pavle Đurišić</a>, which was marching across Bosnia in an attempt to reach Slovenia. The relief effort came too late, because the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps had already been defeated by NDH forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lijev%C4%8De%20Field">Battle of Lijevče Field</a> near <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>, after which Đurišić was captured and killed. The relief force then marched north to Slovenia, where it fought the Partisans before retreating into Austria. These Chetniks were subsequently captured by the Allies and <a href="Bleiburg%20repatriations">repatriated to Yugoslavia</a>, where they were summarily executed by the Partisans. Jevđević remained highly influential among the Chetniks until the end of the war.

In the spring of 1945, Jevđević fled to Italy, where he was arrested by Allied forces and detained at a camp in <a href="Grottaglie">Grottaglie</a>. An estimated 10,000 Chetniks reportedly followed him and Đujić into the country. Jevđević was interned in Grottaglie for some time along with others, including the former Ustaše commissioner for Banja Luka, <a href="Viktor%20Guti%C4%87">Viktor Gutić</a>. During this time, an indictment was issued against him in Sarajevo. It charged that under his command in "the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor [the Italians and Chetniks] butchered and killed 1,716 persons of both sexes, of the Croatian and Muslim nations, and plundered and burnt about 500 households". Jevđević received considerable Allied support in Italy despite being wanted by British authorities in connection with these allegations. On paper, the Chetniks in Italy were listed as "surrendered enemy personnel", but were largely viewed with sympathy by the Allies, who considered them anti-German. Hence, many Chetnik prisoners were handed British Army uniforms and given non-combatant duties throughout Italy, such as guarding munitions and supplies. In August 1945, Jevđević became the commander of a camp for disarmed Chetniks in <a href="Cesena">Cesena</a>. He was eventually set free and Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored.

According to the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA), Jevđević lived in Rome under the aliases "Giovanni St. Angelo" and "Enrico Serrao". He spent most of his time and money quarrelling with émigré Yugoslav politicians, trying to prove that his collaboration with the Italians was necessary in order to protect the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Partisans and Germans. He became a member of the Association of Free Journalists of Central-Eastern Europe, and served as an informant for the Italian intelligence services between 1946 and 1947. During this period, he published a confidential periodical called the "Royal Yugoslav Intelligence Bulletin" which he shared with the Italians. Jevđević also contributed to a number of newspapers, including the Serb nationalist "Srbobran". In 1946, he helped form the Serbian National Committee in Rome and, with help from Achille Marazza, published a pan-Serb and anti-Croat newspaper, "Srpske Novine", in <a href="Eboli">Eboli</a>. He also established contacts with Italian neo-fascist groups and with an anti-communist group called the Committee of Nations Oppressed by Russia.

Disagreement over who would lead the 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy escalated into a feud between Jevđević, Đujić and General Miodrag Damjanović in mid-1947. Damjanović had been appointed by Mihailović in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevđević and Đujić refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailović's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.

By 1949, the CIA claimed that Jevđević's intelligence material was being used by the <a href="Italian%20Ministry%20of%20Interior">Italian Ministry of Interior</a>, the <a href="Counterintelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">United States Counterintelligence Corps</a>, <a href="Forensic%20Science%20Service">British Forensic Science Service</a> in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, <a href="Konstantin%20Foti%C4%87">Konstantin Fotić</a>, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and <a href="Miro%20Didek">Miro Didek</a>, Croat politician <a href="Vladko%20Ma%C4%8Dek">Vladko Maček</a>'s self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and various European countries.

In May and June 1952, Jevđević visited Canada and addressed the Congress of the Serbian National Defense ("Srpska Narodna Odbrana") in <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls</a> regarding developments within Italy's Serb émigré community. The following year, he and Đujić issued a proclamation in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> declaring their intention to organize Chetnik groups against Damjanović, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jevđević later received threatening letters warning him not to go through with such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953. He continued to live in Rome until his death in October 1962.

Flower (video game)

Flower is a <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Thatgamecompany">Thatgamecompany</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. "Flower", designed by <a href="Jenova%20Chen">Jenova Chen</a> and Nicholas Clark, was released in February 2009 on <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, via the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>. <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> versions of the game were ported over by <a href="Bluepoint%20Games">Bluepoint Games</a>, and released in November 2013. An <a href="iOS">iOS</a> version was released in September 2017, and a <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> version was released in February 2019, both published by <a href="Annapurna%20Interactive">Annapurna Interactive</a>. The game was intended as a "<a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a>" to "<a href="Flow%20%28video%20game%29">Flow</a>", a previous title by Chen and Thatgamecompany. In "Flower", the player controls the wind, blowing a flower <a href="petal">petal</a> through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.

"Flower" was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, rather than to be a challenging and "fun" game. This focus was sparked by Chen, who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, dynamically responds to the player's actions and corresponds with the emotional cues in the game. "Flower" was a critical success, to the surprise of the developers. Reviewers praised the game's music, visuals, and gameplay, calling it a unique and compelling emotional experience. It was named the "best independent game of 2009" at the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, and won the "Casual Game of the Year" award by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</a>.

"Flower" is divided up into six main levels and one <a href="Closing%20credits">credits</a> level. Each level is represented by a flower in a pot on a city apartment windowsill, and upon selecting one the player is taken to the "dream" of that flower. Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it blows a single flower petal through the air. Changes in the <a href="Flight%20dynamics">pitch and roll</a> of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> controller. Pressing any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions.

Groups and lines of flowers are present in each level; approaching these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating <a href="wind%20turbines">wind turbines</a>. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">hit points</a>, or <a href="Time%20limit%20%28video%20game%20terminology%29">time limit</a>s. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.

Although no speech or text is used anywhere in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and through the course of the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.

As the player progresses through the different levels of the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played in a similar manner to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. "Flower" includes <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23Trophies">PlayStation Network trophies</a> in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing and watching the scenery.

"Flower" was developed as a spiritual successor to "<a href="Flow%20%28video%20game%29">Flow</a>", a 2006 <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> game created by <a href="Jenova%20Chen">Jenova Chen</a> and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. "Flow" was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by <a href="Thatgamecompany">Thatgamecompany</a> in 2007 and a <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> game by <a href="SuperVillain%20Studios%2C%20Inc.">SuperVillain Studios</a> in 2008. "Flower" was Thatgamecompany's "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> on September 24, 2007, and was released on the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> on February 12, 2009. "Flower" was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer <a href="Kellee%20Santiago">Kellee Santiago</a>, was the creative director in charge of the game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the "nature" theme early in the development process, saying that he "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature".

Before beginning work, the development team commissioned two pieces of music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of <a href="prototype">prototype</a>s, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of that time in the prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, "Flower" was produced in only six months.

The game's focus on emotions was sparked by Chen, who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. Chen tried to make the game focus more on emotions than on a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt there was a message of promoting green energy in the game. To make "Flower" have the "emotional spectrum" that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a "fun" game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. He summarized this view by saying that the only gameplay mechanic is hitting a flower to trigger a new event. The team specifically cut out deeper gameplay elements because these would have added "challenge" to the game, which, while fun, would not have been relaxing. <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Sony Santa Monica</a> contracted with <a href="Bluepoint%20Games">Bluepoint Games</a> to create ports of the game for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>. <a href="Annapurna%20Interactive">Annapurna Interactive</a> brought "Flower" to the <a href="iOS">iOS</a> platform in September 2017, and to <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in February 2019.

The music for "Flower" was created by Vincent Diamante, a video game music composer and professor at the University of Southern California's <a href="USC%20Interactive%20Media%20Division">Interactive Media Division</a>. He had previously scored the music for "<a href="Cloud%20%28video%20game%29">Cloud</a>", Chen's first game, and "Dyadin" when they were both at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.

The music and instruments in each level were chosen to correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and <a href="bassoons">bassoons</a>. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation with the amount of petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>. The album, titled "Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game", contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.

"Flower" was well received by critics. Alice Liang of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> applauded the game, saying that "the freedom of movement makes the game feel as relaxing as a gently wafting breeze". She felt that "fun" did not fully describe the game experience, saying that it had a "well-constructed movie's emotional arc" and that the game's music, visuals, and gameplay all drew the player into a compelling emotional experience. She also felt that it was very replayable, which offset its brevity. Ryan Clements of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> agreed with Liang's opinion, saying that it provided "more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game" he had played in years. Though he noted that the game would not appeal to everyone, he described it as "something very unique and very powerful", referring to it as a "must-play". Michael Kontoudis of <a href="PALGN">PALGN</a> called it an "utterly unique, brave and moving game brimming with personality and intent", though he noted that as it was closer to a work of art than a game, many players would not be interested in it. Gerard Campbell of "<a href="The%20Press">The Press</a>" similarly described it as something more than a game, calling it a "perfect foil" to "ultra-violent shoot-'em-up" games and summarizing it as "one of the most refreshing and relaxing games around".

<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Bramwell had similar praise, describing it as "pleasantly innocent and uplifting", though he awarded it a lower score than other reviewers as he felt the US$9.99 price was too high for the game's length. This criticism was not universal, as reviewers such as Jason Hill of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" called the <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>13 Australian price "reasonable" and described the length as not "overstay[ing] its welcome". Critics such as "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s Terry Terrones and <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> echoed the same praises as other reviewers for the game; GameTrailers said that it was "less a game and more an experience. You don't necessarily "play" Flower; you interact with it," while Terrones noted the music as the best part of the game's presentation. Tom Hoggins of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" felt that "Flower" would "reignite the 'video games as art' debate" and was of the opinion that it was a "wonderful work of art" in addition to a game. The positive reception surprised the developers, as they had expected a mixed reaction.

"Flower" received the "Best Independent Game Fueled by Dew" award in the 2009 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>. It was similarly named the "Best Indie Game" of 2009 by "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>". It was nominated for the 2009 "Outstanding Innovation in Gaming", "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design", "Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition", and "Outstanding Innovation Achievement in Game Direction" awards, and won the "Casual Game of the Year" award by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</a>. It was nominated for the "Use of Audio" <a href="British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">video game awards</a> by the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> and won the "Artistic Achievement" award. Its soundtrack was awarded the 2009 "Best Original Soundtrack" prize from <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>. The music was also nominated for the Game Audio Network Guild's "Music of the Year" award and won the "Best Interactive Score" award. Its gameplay debut at the 2008 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> resulted in multiple awards, including "Best E3 Download Game" from <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, "Best Original Game" from <a href="UGO">UGO</a>, and "Special Achievement for Innovation" from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. In 2012, "Flower" was listed on <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>'s All-TIME 100 greatest video games list.

In 2011, "Flower" was chosen through a public vote out of an initial selection of 240 to be one of 80 games showcased in a 2012 exhibit at the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a> titled "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Video%20Games">The Art of Video Games</a>". In 2013, the museum acquired the game for its permanent collection. The game was showcased in the 2015 Smithsonian exhibition, <a href="Watch%20This%21%20Revelations%20in%20Media%20Art">Watch This!

Rehab (Rihanna song)

"Rehab" is a song recorded by <a href="Barbadian%20people">Barbadian</a> singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a> for her third studio album, "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>" (2007). <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> serviced the song to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> in the United States on October 6, 2008, as the eighth and final single from the album. It was released in the United Kingdom as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> on December 8, 2008. Development of "Rehab" began while Rihanna was accompanying <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> on <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>'s <a href="FutureSex/LoveShow">FutureSex/LoveShow</a> tour in 2007. Timberlake wrote the song in collaboration with his producers, Hannon Lane and Timbaland, and provided additional vocals. "Rehab" is a mid-paced <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song with an emotional, melancholy chorus; the lyrics are about the protagonist's painful memories of her former lover, who is portrayed metaphorically as a disease.

"Rehab" reached top-ten positions on the singles charts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. It reached number 16 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and number 18 on the US "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine's <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Hot 100</a>. It was certified double platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a> directed the accompanying music video, which was shot in <a href="Vasquez%20Rocks%20Park">Vasquez Rocks Park</a>, near <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. It won the <a href="Urban%20Music%20Awards">Urban Music Award</a> for Best Music Video. Rihanna performed "Rehab" on the <a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Tour">Good Girl Gone Bad Tour</a> (2007–09), and occasionally on the <a href="Last%20Girl%20on%20Earth">Last Girl on Earth</a> (2010–11).

"Rehab" is one of the three songs composed and produced by Timbaland for Rihanna's third studio album, "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>". Timbaland was on <a href="FutureSex/LoveShow">tour</a> with Justin Timberlake to promote Timberlake's 2006 album "<a href="FutureSex/LoveSounds">FutureSex/LoveSounds</a>", which Timbaland had also produced. After completing a show in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies. Weeks later, the three got together in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where Timberlake had already conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who wanted to compose a song called "Rehab" for Rihanna, was producing a beat, when Timberlake came in and improvised the song over it. Hannon Lane co-wrote and co-produced the song, and Demacio Castellon recorded and mixed it in 2007 at Roc The Mic Studios in New York City. Rihanna's stint with Timbaland also resulted in "Sell Me Candy" and "Lemme Get That", produced for "Good Girl Gone Bad".

Timberlake told "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" that he believed "Rehab" to be "the bridge for [Rihanna] to be accepted as an adult in the music industry". Rihanna told Robert Copsey of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions. She said, "Working with Justin in the studio is just great. He's a fun guy and likes to make all the sessions enjoyable. He's also such a genius when it comes to lyrics."

"Rehab" was the eighth and final single to be released from Rihanna's third studio album "Good Girl Gone Bad" (2007). According to American music magazine "<a href="Rap-Up">Rap-Up</a>", both "Breakin' Dishes" and "Rehab" were potential single releases, but "Rehab" was chosen. <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> released the song for airplay on <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> in the United States on October 6, 2008. On November 3, 2008, it was released to <a href="rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic contemporary</a> and <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban contemporary</a> radio stations. The single was released in the UK by <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a> on December 8, 2008, as a <a href="Compact%20Disc%20single">CD single</a> containing both the album version and an instrumental version of "Rehab". On the same date, it was released as a digital download in Ireland. A live performance of the song, recorded in Manchester during Rihanna's <a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Tour">Good Girl Gone Bad Tour</a> (2007–09), was released for download on the UK and Ireland <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>s. The performance was featured on Rihanna's DVD "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Live">Good Girl Gone Bad Live</a>".

On December 12, 2008, the song and its instrumental version were released on iTunes and <a href="7digital">7digital</a> in ten countries, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In January 2009, it was released as a CD single in Germany, with the same material as in the UK release. In early 2009, Timbaland signed a contract with <a href="Verizon%20Communications">Verizon Communications</a>, under which he would create music exclusively for <a href="BlackBerry%20Storm">BlackBerry Storm</a> mobile phone owners. He was contracted to work with various artists and remix their songs, which would be available for Verizon customers to download at no extra cost. "Rehab" was the first song remixed for the project, and this version was released in Canada and the US on May 19, 2009, via iTunes.

"Rehab" is a mid-<a href="tempo">tempo</a> <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> <a href="sentimental%20ballad">ballad</a> with a subtle <a href="backbeat">backbeat</a>. According to the digital sheet music published by <a href="Sony/ATV%20Music%20Publishing">Sony/ATV Music Publishing</a>, it is written in the key of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> and set in <a href="common%20time">common time</a>, with a moderately slow <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>. The vocal range spans nearly an octave and a half from <a href="F%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a> to <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a>. "Rehab" opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a <a href="violin">violin</a>, <a href="cello">cello</a>, and <a href="tambourine">tambourine</a> instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody. Rihanna then sings the opening lines, "Baby, baby, when we first met, I never felt something so strong".

Critics noted similarities among the structures of "Rehab" and some of Timberlake's songs, such as "<a href="What%20Goes%20Around...%20Comes%20Around">What Goes Around... Comes Around</a>" and "<a href="Cry%20Me%20a%20River%20%28Justin%20Timberlake%20song%29">Cry Me a River</a>". Spence D. of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> wrote that the song has an "R&B swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for "Entertainment Weekly", Rihanna explained the meaning of the song's lyrics: "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means we have to get over the guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." Watson further called the song a "lovesick ballad".

Rodney Dugue of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" called it one of the standout songs on "Good Girl Gone Bad", and Sarah Rodman of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" said it was essential to the album. Quentin B. Huff of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> called it a "little gem" and compared it to <a href="Babyface%20%28musician%29">Babyface</a>'s collaboration with Madonna on her 1994 single "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>". "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine called the song a highlight of the album, with "slinky-assisted Timberlake background vocals, tension-filled production, and contrasting strings and guitars." "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>"'s Shanel Odum, while reviewing "Good Girl Gone Bad", noted that the album predominantly consists of up-tempo songs, while the ballads are its weak part, eventually being "saved" by "Rehab". Spence D. of IGN stated that Timberlake and Rihanna work well together, thanks to their similar vocal ranges. He wrote that the song "reverts to Rihanna's old styled R&B swoon, the groove being built around tambourine shakes, acoustic guitar swirls, and a subtle backbeat." Doug Rule of "<a href="Metro%20Weekly">Metro Weekly</a>" wrote that "Rehab" "is its own distinctive song—and a fetching one at that—but the resemblance to one of Timberlake's best is unmistakable." Sylvia Patterson from "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described the song as a "mournful tale of lost love feeling like a catastrophic rehab meltdown".

Tom Breinan of <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> wrote that Rihanna "comes closer than usual to depicting something resembling human emotion, but she still comes off sounding like a robot programmed to impersonate <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>." <a href="Neil%20Drumming">Neil Drumming</a> of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote, "Rehab is a joyless overdose of mid-tempo melodrama". Sal Cinquemani of <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> said that "Rehab" proves that Timberlake "is better off penning lyrics about sexy backs or dicks in boxes"—a reference to Timberlake's 2006 singles "<a href="SexyBack">SexyBack</a>" and "<a href="Dick%20in%20a%20Box">Dick in a Box</a>".

"Rehab" entered the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart at number 91 on November 22, 2008, and peaked at number 18, making it Rihanna's twelfth US top-twenty single. It also peaked at number 17 on "Billboard"'s <a href="Mainstream%20Top%2040%20%28Pop%20Songs%29">Pop Songs</a> chart and at number 52 on the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart. The song rose to number 19 on the <a href="Canadian%20Hot%20100">Canadian Hot 100</a> chart, having started at number 56 on December 6, 2008. It entered the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian ARIA Singles Chart</a> at number 37 on November 17, 2008 and eventually reached number 26, thus becoming Rihanna's twelfth consecutive top-thirty single in Australia. In New Zealand, it first entered the singles chart at number 24 on October 27, 2008, and rose to number 12. On January 11, 2009, it was certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">Recording Industry Association of New Zealand</a> (RIANZ), 12 weeks after it first charted.

"Rehab" first appeared in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> at number 51 on November 22, 2008. After two weeks, it became the greatest gainer on the chart, climbing twenty-seven places to number 24, and in the week after that, it reached its peak of 16. More than 160,000 copies of the song have been sold in the UK. The single debuted at number 33 on the <a href="%C3%963%20Austria%20Top%2040">Ö3 Austria Top 40</a> and peaked at number nine. In Germany it reached number 4 and became Rihanna's sixth top-five single. "Rehab" started at number 18 in the <a href="Dutch%20Top%2040">Dutch Top 40</a> on January 17, 2009, and peaked at number 3 in its fourth week on the chart. In Norway it entered the singles chart at number 19 and climbed to number 4, becoming Rihanna's seventh top-five single in that country. It peaked at number 8 on the Slovakian singles chart, becoming Rihanna's fifth international top-ten single, and her sixth top-ten single in Slovakia.
It has also peaked at #1 in Israel, the only country in which it did.

Rihanna filmed the music video for "Rehab" with Justin Timberlake at <a href="Vasquez%20Rocks%20Park">Vasquez Rocks Park</a>, near Los Angeles, on October 22, 2008. It was directed by <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>, who directed the videos for Rihanna's 2008 singles "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>" and "<a href="Disturbia%20%28song%29">Disturbia</a>". Photographs of the production were leaked on the same day. Tim Nixon of "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" wrote that the "red hot chemistry" between Rihanna and Timberlake must have been difficult for their partners to watch. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said that Timberlake's partner <a href="Jessica%20Biel">Jessica Biel</a> was "said to be 'sick to her stomach' after seeing Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while filming with Timberlake." Timberlake told "<a href="Access%20Hollywood">Access Hollywood</a>", "I’m the guy in the video, so I had to give them all insecurities about that. But yeah we had a great time, we goofed around at the shoot most of the time." The video premiered November 17, 2008, on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>.

The video begins as Rihanna, scantily dressed and wearing fishnet stockings, stands against a convertible car in a desert. Timberlake, wearing a leather jacket and black jeans, arrives on a motorcycle. He unbuttons his jacket to cool down and bathes in pink-colored water before greeting Rihanna at her <a href="Airstream">Airstream</a> trailer. The pair then climb onto the hood of the vintage car. In the next scene, Timberlake plays a guitar while lying on a large rocket. Throughout the video, Timberlake and Rihanna vary their poses from sultry to defensive.
David Balls of Digital Spy wrote, "The pop pair put in such a highly-charged, effortlessly sexual display that it's no surprise Justin's lady was far from happy." Tim Nixon of "The Sun" noted, "the sight of sexy Rihanna—clad in a series of tantalising costumes—writhing around with Justin is a real treat." In his book "Post Cinematic Affect" (2010), <a href="Steven%20Shaviro">Steven Shaviro</a> wrote that, in the videos of "Rehab", "<a href="Love%20Sex%20Magic">Love Sex Magic</a>" and "<a href="4%20Minutes%20%28Madonna%20song%29">4 Minutes</a>", Timberlake "radiates a smothering sexual heat", and that these videos "can be contrasted with the videos from Timberlake's own "Future Sex/Love Sounds" album which Joshua Clover convincingly describes as a 'homosocial' exchange between Timberlake and his producer Timbaland". The "Rehab" video won the Best Music Video award at the <a href="2009%20Urban%20Music%20Awards">2009 Urban Music Awards</a>.

On April 28, 2008, Rihanna performed at the <a href="Pepsi%20Center">Pepsi Center</a> with <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, <a href="N.E.R.D">N.E.R.D</a>, and <a href="Lupe%20Fiasco">Lupe Fiasco</a>. She sang "Rehab" and other songs from "Good Girl Gone Bad". John Wenzel of "<a href="The%20Denver%20Post">The Denver Post</a>" wrote that "Rehab" and other songs "would have benefited from more backing vocals, or perhaps a more focused performance approach". To promote the single, Rihanna performed "Rehab" live on November 23, 2008, at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202008">2008 American Music Awards</a>, where she won the awards for <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Favorite%20Pop/Rock%20Female%20Artist">Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist</a> and <a href="American%20Music%20Award%20for%20Favorite%20Soul/R%26amp%3BB%20Female%20Artist">Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist</a>. At the awards ceremony, she performed it wearing an eye patch, which she later removed after she was lowered to the main stage.

"Rehab" was the fourth song on the set list for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour . Her performance in Manchester was released in the UK through iTunes and is featured on the "Good Girl Gone Bad Live" DVD. Rihanna performed "Rehab" on February 7, 2009, at a pre-<a href="Grammy">Grammy</a> party. She was scheduled to perform at the <a href="51st%20Grammy%20Awards">51st Grammy Awards</a> ceremony, but canceled her performance after an altercation with her then boyfriend, singer <a href="Chris%20Brown%20%28American%20singer%29">Chris Brown</a>.

"Rehab" was the twelfth song on Rihanna's set list for her 2010 <a href="Last%20Girl%20on%20Earth%20Tour">Last Girl on Earth Tour</a>, throughout which she performed it on a therapist's couch adorned with metal casts of human heads and limbs. David Sprague of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called her performance of "Rehab" at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> dishearteningly leaden. Ben Ratliff from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "Rihanna's lip curl during 'Rehab' and her low hip-grind during '<a href="Rude%20Boy%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Rude Boy</a>' were the smash hits of her body language." Deborah Linton of "<a href="City%20Life%20%28magazine%29">City Life</a>" wrote that Rihanna "even manages to make a psychiatric couch look sexy". Linton called the show's stage sets impressive and imaginative. Rick Massimo of "<a href="The%20Providence%20Journal">The Providence Journal</a>" wrote that Rihanna "looked like a neon-sign rendition of herself during 'Rehab', rarely addressed the audience, and didn't rise above flat cliché in that until the very end of the show". "Rehab" and Rihanna's 2009 single "<a href="Russian%20Roulette%20%28song%29">Russian Roulette</a>" were excluded from the set list during the tour's Australian leg.

Shōkaku-class aircraft carrier

The two <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s were built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) in the late 1930s. Completed shortly before the start of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in 1941, they have been called "arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" when built. With the exception of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, they participated in every major naval action of the Pacific War, including the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20Raid">Indian Ocean Raid</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>, and the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>.

Their inexperienced air groups were relegated to airfield attacks during the attack on Pearl Harbor, but they later sank two of the <a href="List%20of%20sunken%20aircraft%20carriers%23United%20States">four fleet carriers lost</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the war in addition to one elderly British <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a>. The <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s returned to Japan after the Battle of the Coral Sea, one to repair damage and the other to replace aircraft lost during the battle, so neither ship participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After the catastrophic losses of four carriers during that battle, they formed the bulk of the IJN's carrier force for the rest of the war. As such they were the primary <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> force deployed against the American invasion of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a> in August. Two months later, they attempted to support a major offensive by the Imperial Japanese Army to push the <a href="United%20States%20Marines">United States Marines</a> off Guadalcanal. This resulted in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a> where they crippled one American carrier and damaged another in exchange for damage to and a light carrier. Neither attempt succeeded and the Japanese withdrew their remaining forces from Guadalcanal in early 1943 using the air group from to provide cover.

For the next year, the sisters trained before moving south to defend against any American attempt to retake the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> or the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. "Shōkaku" was sunk by an American <a href="submarine">submarine</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> in June 1944 as the Americans invaded the Marianas and "Zuikaku" was sacrificed as a decoy four months later during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Engano">Battle of Cape Engano</a>.

The two "Shōkaku"-class carriers were ordered in 1937 as part of the <a href="3rd%20Naval%20Armaments%20Supplement%20Programme">3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Program</a>. No longer restricted by the provisions of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, which had expired in December 1936, and with relaxed budgetary limitations, the IJN sought qualitative superiority over their foreign counterparts. Drawing on experience with their existing carriers, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20General%20Staff">Navy General Staff</a> laid out an ambitious requirement for a ship that equaled the 96-aircraft capacity of the and , the speed of and the defensive armament of "Kaga". The new ship was also to have superior protection and range over any of the existing carriers.

The Basic Design Section of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Technical%20Department">Navy Technical Department</a> decided upon an enlarged and improved "Hiryū" design with the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">island</a> on the port side, <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. After construction of the ships began, the Naval Air Technical Department (NATD) began having second thoughts about the location of the island because it thought that the portside location of the island on "Hiryū" and "Akagi" had an adverse impact on airflow over the flight deck. Another issue identified was that the amidships position shortened the available landing area, which had the potential to be problematic in the future as aircraft landing speeds increased with their growing weight. To verify these assumptions, the NATD filmed hundreds of takeoffs and landings aboard "Akagi" in October–November 1938 and decided to move the island over to the starboard side and further forward, about one-third of the length from the bow. "Shōkaku" was the furthest advanced by this point and the supporting structure for the bridge had already been built; rebuilding it would have delayed construction so it was left in place. The changes that had to be made consisted of a widening of the flight deck opposite the island and a corresponding narrowing on the starboard side and the addition of of <a href="ballast%20%28ship%29">ballast</a> on the port side to re-balance the ship.

The ships had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>, and a <a href="moulded%20depth">moulded depth</a> of . They <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at deep load. Based on hydrodynamic research conducted for the s, the "Shōkaku" class received a <a href="bulbous%20bow">bulbous bow</a> and twin <a href="rudder">rudder</a>s, both of which were positioned on the centerline <a href="abaft">abaft</a> the propellers. Their crew consisted of 1, 660 men: 75 <a href="commissioned%20officer">commissioned officer</a>s, 56 special duty officers, 71 <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a>s and 1,458 <a href="petty%20officer">petty officer</a>s and crewmen, excluding the air group.

The "Shōkaku"-class ships were fitted with four <a href="Kampon">Kampon</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, each driving one propeller, using steam provided by eight Kampon Type Model B <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. With a working pressure of , the boilers gave the turbines enough steam to generate a total of and a designed speed of . This was the most powerful propulsion system in IJN service, more than the "Yamato" class and the , respectively. During their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, the sister ships achieved from . They carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which gave them a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ships' starboard side amidships and exhausted just below <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> level through two <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>s that curved downward. The "Shōkaku" class was fitted with three <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s and two <a href="diesel%20generator">diesel generator</a>s, all operating at 225 <a href="volt">volt</a>s.

The carriers' flight deck had a maximum width of 29 meters and overhung the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> at both ends, supported by pillars. Ten transverse <a href="arrestor%20wire">arrestor wire</a>s were installed on the flight deck that could stop a aircraft. If the aircraft missed those, it could be stopped by one of three <a href="Arresting%20gear%23Barricade">crash barricades</a>. Although space and weight were allocated for two <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a>s, their development was not completed before the "Shōkaku"-class ships were sunk. The ships were designed with two superimposed <a href="hangar">hangar</a>s; the upper hangar was about long and had a width that varied between . It had a height of while the lower hangar was high and only usable by fighters. The lower hangar was about shorter than the upper one and its width ranged from . Together they had a total area of . Each hangar could be subdivided by five or six fire curtains and they were fitted with <a href="fire%20fighting%20foam">fire fighting foam</a> dispensers on each side. The lower hangar was also fitted with a <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> <a href="Gaseous%20fire%20suppression">fire suppression system</a>. Each subdivision was provided with a pair of enclosed and armored stations to control the fire curtains and fire fighting equipment.

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">elevators</a> that took 15 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. The forward elevator was larger than the others to allow aircraft that had just landed to be moved below without folding their wings and measured . The other elevators were narrower, . The ships mounted a <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> on the starboard side of the flight deck, abreast the rear elevator. When collapsed, it was flush with the flight deck.

The "Shōkaku"-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. These were envisioned as 12 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> ("Claude") <a href="monoplane">monoplane</a> fighters, 24 <a href="Aichi%20D1A2">Aichi D1A2</a> ("Susie") Type 96 <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s, 24 <a href="Mitsubishi%20B5M">Mitsubishi B5M</a> ("Mabel") Type 97 No. 2 <a href="torpedo%20bombers">torpedo bombers</a>, and 12 <a href="Nakajima%20C3N">Nakajima C3N</a> Type 97 <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a>. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised to consist of 18 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a>s, 27 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a> ("Val") dive bombers, and 27 <a href="Nakajima%20B5N">Nakajima B5N</a> ("Kate") torpedo bombers. In addition, the ship carried 2 Zeros, 5 "Vals", and 5 "Kates" as spares for a total of 84 aircraft.

The carriers' primary <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA)</a> armament consisted of eight twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> <a href="12.7%20cm/40%20Type%2089%20naval%20gun">12.7-centimeter (5 in) Type 89</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s mounted on projecting <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s, grouped into pairs fore and aft on each side of the hull. The guns had a range of , and a <a href="ceiling%20%28aircraft%29">ceiling</a> of at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was fourteen rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with four Type 94 <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a> to control the 12.7 cm guns, one for each pair of guns, although the director on the island could control all of the Type 89 guns.

Their light AA armament consisted of a dozen triple-gun mounts for <a href="license-built">license-built</a> <a href="25%20mm%20Hotchkiss%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun">25 mm (1 in) Type 96</a> AA guns, six mounts on each side of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA weapon during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to "handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast". These guns had an effective range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazines</a>. The Type 96 guns were controlled by six Type 95 directors, one for every pair of mounts.

In June 1942, "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" had their anti-aircraft armament augmented with six more triple 25 mm mounts, two each at the bow and stern, and one each fore and aft of the island. The bow and stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25 mm mount was added at the bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After the battle, "Zuikaku"s anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 26 single mounts for the 25 mm Type 96 gun, bringing the total of 25 mm barrels to 96, 60 in 20 triple mounts and 36 single mounts. These guns were supplemented by eight 28-round AA rocket launchers. Each rocket weighed and had a maximum velocity of . Their maximum range was .
"Shōkaku" was the first carrier in the IJN to be fitted with <a href="radar">radar</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20Radar">Type 21</a> <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>, mounted on the top of the island around September 1942. The date of "Zuikaku"s installation is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The "Shōkaku"-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a> in the bow that was only useful when anchored or moving very slowly.

The "Shōkaku" class had a <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> that consisted of of <a href="Copper-alloy%20non-cemented%20armor">Copper-alloy Non-Cemented</a> armor (CNC) that covered most of the length of the ship. The belt was high, of which was below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. The lower <a href="strake">strake</a> of the armor was backed by of <a href="Ducol%20steel">Ducol steel</a>. The <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s were protected by of <a href="New%20Vickers%20non-cemented%20armor">New Vickers Non-Cemented</a> (NVNC) armor, sloped at an inclination up to 25° and tapered to thicknesses of . The flight and both hangar <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decks</a> were unprotected and the ships' propulsion machinery was protected by a deck of CNC armor. The NVNC armor over the magazines was thick and thick over the <a href="aviation%20gasoline">aviation gasoline</a> storage tanks. All of the deck armor was overlaid on a 25-millimeter deck of Ducol steel.

The "Shōkaku"s were the first Japanese carriers to incorporate a <a href="torpedo%20belt">torpedo belt</a> system. Based on model experiments that began in 1935, it consisted of a liquid-loaded "sandwich" of compartments outboard of the <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>. The experiments showed that a narrow liquid-loaded compartment was necessary to distribute the force of a torpedo or <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a>'s detonation along the torpedo bulkhead by spreading it across the full width of the bulkhead and to stop the splinters created by the detonation. Outboard of this were two compartments intended to dissipate the force of the gases of the detonation, including the <a href="Ship%20floodability">watertight compartment</a> of the <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>. The two innermost compartments were intended to be filled with fuel oil that would be replaced by water as it was consumed. The torpedo bulkhead itself consisted of an outer Ducol plate thick that was riveted to a plate. The IJN expected the torpedo bulkhead to be damaged in an attack and placed a thin holding <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> slightly inboard to prevent any leaks from reaching the ships' vitals.

Shortly after completion in 1941, "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" were assigned to the newly formed <a href="Fifth%20Carrier%20Division">Fifth Carrier Division</a>, which was itself assigned to the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Air Fleet</a> ("Kidō Butai"), and began <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> to prepare for the Pearl Harbor attack. Due to their inexperience, their air groups were tasked with the less demanding airfield attack role rather than the anti-ship mission allocated to the veteran air groups of the older carriers. Each carrier's aircraft complement consisted of 18 Zero fighters, 27 D3A dive bombers, and 27 B5N torpedo bombers. The two carriers contributed a total of 12 Zeros and 54 D3As to the first wave on the morning of 8 December 1941 (Japan time); these latter aircraft struck <a href="Wheeler%20Army%20Airfield">Wheeler Army Airfield</a>, <a href="Hickam%20Field">Hickam Field</a>, and <a href="Ford%20Island">Naval Air Station Ford Island</a> while the fighters <a href="strafed">strafed</a> <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Kaneohe%20Bay">Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay</a>. Only the 54 B5Ns participated in the second wave, striking Ford Island, Hickam Field and Kaneohe Bay again. The Fifth Carrier Division's aircraft conducted the majority of the attack against the airfields, supplemented only by fighters from the other four carriers. Only one of "Shōkaku"s dive bombers was lost during the attack; in exchange 314 American aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Historian Alan Zimm said the young aviators delivered "a sterling performance, greatly exceeding expectations and outshining the dive bombers from the more experienced carriers."

In January 1942, together with "Akagi" and "Kaga" of the <a href="First%20Carrier%20Division">First Carrier Division</a>, the sisters supported the <a href="battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">invasion of Rabaul</a> in the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. Aircraft from all four carriers attacked the Australian base at Rabaul on 20 January; the First Carrier Division continued to attack the town while the Fifth Carrier Division moved westwards and attacked <a href="Lae">Lae</a> and <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a> in New Guinea. They covered the landings at Rabaul and <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> on 23 January before returning to <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> before the end of the month. After the <a href="Marshalls%E2%80%93Gilberts%20raids">Marshalls–Gilberts raids</a> on 1 February, the Fifth Carrier Division was retained in home waters until mid-March to defend against any American carrier raids on the <a href="Japanese%20archipelago">Home Islands</a>.

The sister ships then rejoined the "Kido Butai" at <a href="Staring%20Bay">Staring Bay</a> on <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes Island</a> in preparation for the Indian Ocean raid. By this time the air groups had been reorganized to consist of 21 each of the A6Ms, D3As and B5Ns. The Japanese intent was to defeat the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> and destroy British airpower in the region in order to secure the flank of their <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">operations in Burma</a>. "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" contributed aircraft to the 5 April <a href="Easter%20Sunday%20Raid">Easter Sunday Raid</a> on <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>. Although the civilian shipping had been evacuated from Colombo harbor, the Japanese sank an <a href="armed%20merchant%20cruiser">armed merchant cruiser</a>, a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>, and severely damaged some of the support facilities. The "Kido Butai" returned to Ceylon four days later and attacked Trincomalee; the sisters' aircraft sank a large <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> and damaged the <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a> . In the meantime, the Japanese spotted the <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a> , escorted by the destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. Aircraft from "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" were the first to attack the Allied ships, both of which were sunk.

En route to Japan, the Fifth Carrier Division was diverted to Truk to support <a href="Operation%20Mo">Operation Mo</a> (the planned capture of <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>). While they were preparing for the mission, the Americans <a href="Signals%20intelligence%20in%20modern%20history">intercepted</a> and <a href="Cryptography">decrypted</a> <a href="Japanese%20naval%20codes">Japanese naval messages</a> discussing the operation and dispatched the carriers and to stop the invasion. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, on 3 May. American land-based aircraft had spotted the light carrier escorting the transports of the main invasion force on 6 May, and the American carriers moved west to place themselves in a position to attack it the following morning.
"Shōhō" was quickly located again that morning and sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the <a href="oiler%20%28ship%29">oiler</a>, , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>. A single dive bomber was lost during the consequent airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged "Neosho" badly enough that she had to be <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American <a href="Combat%20Air%20Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.

On the morning of 8 May, both sides located each other at about the same time and began launching their aircraft about 09:00. The American dive bombers disabled "Shōkaku"s flight deck with three hits, but the carrier was able to evade all of the torpedoes. Hidden by a rain squall, "Zuikaku" escaped detection and was not attacked. In return, the Japanese aircraft badly damaged "Lexington" with two torpedo and two bomb hits and scored a single bomb hit on "Yorktown". The torpedo hits on "Lexington" cracked one of her <a href="avgas">avgas</a> tanks, and leaking vapor caused a series of large explosions that caused her to be scuttled.
The air groups of the sisters were decimated in the battle, which forced "Zuikaku" to return to Japan with "Shōkaku" for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier was able to take part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June. En route to Japan, "Shōkaku" was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was not ready for action until late August.

The <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi</a> on 7 August 1942 caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, the light carrier joined the sister ships in the First Carrier Division, which departed for Truk on 16 August. Having learned the lesson taught at Midway, the IJN strengthened the fighter contingent at the expense of the torpedo bombers assigned to its carriers; the "Shōkaku"-class carriers mustered 53 Zeros, 51 D3As, 36 B5Ns and 2 <a href="Yokosuka%20D4Y">Yokosuka D4Y</a>1-C "Judy" reconnaissance aircraft between them. After an American carrier was spotted near the Solomon Islands on 21 August, the division was ordered to bypass Truk and continue to the south. "Ryūjō" was detached early on 24 August to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and to attack the American air base at <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> if no carriers were located. The two fleet carriers were to stand off, prepared to attack the Americans if found.

"Ryūjō" and her escorts were the first Japanese ships spotted and sunk by the Americans later that morning, but "Zuikaku" and "Shōkaku" were not spotted until the afternoon. Shortly before an unsuccessful attack by the pair of <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas SBD Dauntless</a>es conducting the search, the sisters launched half of their dive bombers to attack the American carriers and . Most of the American carrier aircraft were already airborne by this time, either on CAP, returning from search missions, or from sinking "Ryūjō", so only a small airstrike was launched in response to the spot report. About an hour after the first Japanese airstrike took off, a second airstrike that included the rest of the dive bombers was launched, but their target location was mistaken and they failed to find the Americans. The first airstrike attacked the two American carriers, scoring one hit on the battleship and three hits on "Enterprise", but they were mauled by the large number of airborne American aircraft and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Uncertain of the damage inflicted on each other, both sides disengaged later that evening.

The First Carrier Division, now including the light carrier , departed Truk on 11 October to support the Japanese Army operation to capture <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal. At this time, the sisters mustered 54 A6Ms, 45 D3As, and 36 B5Ns between them. Four days later, the Japanese spotted a small American convoy that consisted of a <a href="tugboat">fleet tug</a> towing a gasoline <a href="barge">barge</a> and escorted by the destroyer . Aircraft from "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" sank the latter, but did not attack the tug.
The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October and each side launched air strikes. "Shōkaku" was badly damaged by six hits from 's dive bombers; "Zuikaku" was not spotted or attacked as she was hidden by the overcast conditions, just like at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In exchange, the Japanese crippled "Hornet" with two torpedoes and three bombs. In addition, two aircraft crashed into the American carrier and inflicted serious damage. "Enterprise" was also damaged by two bomb hits and a near miss and a destroyer was damaged when it was struck by a B5N. Attacks later in the day further damaged "Hornet", which was abandoned and later sunk by Japanese destroyers and . The Japanese lost nearly half their aircraft that participated in the battle, together with their irreplaceable experienced aircrew. On 2 November, the First Carrier Division was ordered home for repairs and training.

"Shōkaku"s repairs continued until March 1943 and "Zuikaku", together with the recently repaired "Zuihō", sailed for Truk on 17 January to support the impending evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal (<a href="Operation%20Ke">Operation Ke</a>). On 29 January, the two carriers flew off 47 Zeros to Rabaul and <a href="Kahili%20Airfield">Kahili Airfield</a>, contributing some of their own aircraft and pilots. "Zuihō" was then used to cover the evacuation, while "Zuikaku" remained at Truk, together with the two "Yamato"-class battleships, acting as a <a href="fleet%20in%20being">fleet in being</a> threatening to sortie at any time.

In May, "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" were assigned to a mission to counterattack the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">American offensive</a> in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu</a> on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were transferred to Truk in July. In response to the carrier raid on <a href="Tarawa">Tarawa</a> on 18 September, the carriers and much of the fleet sortied for <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, and on 17 October, "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk. At the beginning of November, the bulk of their air groups were transferred to Rabaul to bolster the defenses there, just in time to help defend the port against the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Rabaul%20%28November%201943%29">Allied attack</a> a few days later. They accomplished little there, for the loss of over half their number, before returning to Truk on the 13th. The sisters returned to Japan in December.

In February 1944, "Shōkaku" and "Zuikaku" were transferred to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. On 1 March the carrier divisions were reorganized with the new fleet carrier replacing "Zuihō" in the division. The First Carrier Division sailed in mid-May for <a href="Tawi-Tawi">Tawi-Tawi</a> in the Philippines. The new base was closer to the oil wells in <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> on which the IJN relied and also to the <a href="Palau">Palau</a> and western <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> where the Japanese expected the next American attack; the location lacked an airfield on which to train the inexperienced pilots and American submarine activity restricted the ships to the anchorage.

The <a href="1st%20Mobile%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Mobile Fleet</a> was en route to <a href="Guimaras%20Island">Guimaras Island</a> in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa">Jisaburō Ozawa</a> learned of the American attack on the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a> where they spotted <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a> on 18 June. At this time, the sister ships mustered 54 Zeros, 60 D4Ys and 36 <a href="Nakajima%20B6N">Nakajima B6N</a> "Jill" torpedo bombers. As the carriers were launching their first airstrike the following morning, "Taihō" was torpedoed by an American submarine and later sank. Later that morning, "Shōkaku" was torpedoed by a different submarine, . The three or four torpedoes started multiple fires in the hangar, which ignited fueling aircraft, in addition to causing heavy flooding. As the bow continued to sink, aircraft and munitions began to slide forward and a bomb in the hangar detonated. This ignited gas and oil fumes which caused a series of four explosions that gutted the ship. "Shōkaku" sank several minutes later with the loss of 1,263 of her crew. 570 men were rescued by a light cruiser and a destroyer.

The loss of "Taihō" and "Shōkaku" left "Zuikaku" to recover the Division's few remaining aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until the afternoon of the following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting "Zuikaku" with a single bomb that started a fire in the hangar.

 In October 1944, "Zuikaku" was the flagship of Admiral <a href="Jisaburo%20Ozawa">Jisaburo Ozawa</a>'s decoy Northern Force in <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Operation "Shō-Gō 1"</a>, the Japanese counterattack against the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">Allied landings on Leyte</a>. At this time, the ship had 28 A6M5 Zero fighters, 16 A6M2 Zero <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s, 7 D4Y reconnaissance aircraft and 15 B6Ns. On the morning of 24 October, she launched 10 fighters, 11 fighter-bombers, 6 torpedo bombers, and 2 reconnaissance aircraft as her contribution to the airstrike intended to attract the attention of the American carriers away from the other task groups that were to destroy the landing forces. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks and finally found the Northern Force late that afternoon, but Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>, commander of <a href="Task%20Force%2038">Task Force 38</a>, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He turned all of his ships north to position himself for an attack.
The American carriers launched an airstrike shortly after dawn; "Zuikaku" was struck by three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>, and gave her a 29.5° <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before "Zuikaku" sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.

Ancient Egyptian literature

Ancient Egyptian literature was written in the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a> from <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>'s <a href="History%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">pharaonic period</a> until the end of <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman domination</a>. It represents the oldest <a href="Text%20corpus">corpus</a> of <a href="Literature%20of%20Egypt">Egyptian literature</a>. Along with <a href="Sumerian%20literature">Sumerian literature</a>, it is considered the world's <a href="Ancient%20literature">earliest literature</a>.

<a href="Writing%20in%20ancient%20Egypt">Writing in ancient Egypt</a>—both <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic</a> and <a href="hieratic">hieratic</a>—first appeared in the late 4th millennium BC during the late phase of <a href="predynastic%20Egypt">predynastic Egypt</a>. By the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (26th century BC to 22nd century BC), literary works included <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a>, <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s and letters, <a href="hymns">hymns</a> and poems, and commemorative <a href="Autobiography">autobiographical</a> texts recounting the careers of prominent administrative officials. It was not until the early <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (21st century BC to 17th century BC) that a narrative Egyptian literature was created. This was a "media revolution" which, according to <a href="Richard%20B.%20Parkinson">Richard B. Parkinson</a>, was the result of the rise of an intellectual class of <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s, new cultural sensibilities about individuality, unprecedented levels of literacy, and mainstream access to written materials. However, it is possible that the overall <a href="literacy%20rate">literacy rate</a> was less than one percent of the entire population. The creation of literature was thus an elite exercise, monopolized by a scribal class attached to government offices and the royal court of the ruling <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>. However, there is no full consensus among modern scholars concerning the dependence of ancient Egyptian literature on the sociopolitical order of the royal courts.

<a href="Middle%20Egyptian">Middle Egyptian</a>, the <a href="spoken%20language">spoken language</a> of the Middle Kingdom, became a <a href="classical%20language">classical language</a> during the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (16th century BC to 11th century BC), when the <a href="vernacular%20language">vernacular language</a> known as <a href="Late%20Egyptian">Late Egyptian</a> first appeared in writing. Scribes of the New Kingdom and copied many literary texts written in Middle Egyptian, which remained the language used for oral readings of sacred hieroglyphic texts. Some genres of Middle Kingdom literature, such as "<a href="Sebayt">teachings</a>" and <a href="Traditional%20stories">fictional tales</a>, remained popular in the New Kingdom, although the genre of <a href="Prophecy">prophetic texts</a> was not revived until the <a href="History%20of%20Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic period</a> (4th century BC to 1st century BC). Popular tales included the "<a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>" and "<a href="The%20Eloquent%20Peasant">The Eloquent Peasant</a>", while important teaching texts include the "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Amenemhat">Instructions of Amenemhat</a>" and "<a href="The%20Loyalist%20Teaching">The Loyalist Teaching</a>". By the New Kingdom period, the writing of commemorative graffiti on sacred temple and tomb walls flourished as a unique genre of literature, yet it employed formulaic phrases similar to other genres. The acknowledgment of rightful authorship remained important only in a few genres, while texts of the "teaching" genre were <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ous and falsely attributed to prominent historical figures.

Ancient Egyptian literature has been preserved on a wide variety of media. This includes <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic <a href="ostracon">ostraca</a>, wooden writing boards, <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">monumental stone edifices</a> and <a href="Coffin%20Texts">coffins</a>. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the <a href="Flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">floodplain of the Nile</a> is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.

By the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Early Dynastic Period</a> in the late 4th millennium BC, <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> and their cursive form <a href="hieratic">hieratic</a> were well-established <a href="Writing%20system">written scripts</a>. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. For example, the hieroglyph for <a href="door%20bolt%20%28s%20hieroglyph%29">door-bolt</a>, pronounced "se", produced the "<a href="s">s</a>" sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination of sounds that could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The <a href="Narmer%20Palette">Narmer Palette</a>, dated "<a href="Circa">c</a>". 3100 BC during the last phase of <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic Egypt</a>, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and chisel to produce the name of King <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a>.

The Egyptians called their hieroglyphs "words of god" and reserved their use for exalted purposes, such as communicating with <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">divinities and spirits of the dead</a> through <a href="funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a>. Each hieroglyphic word represented both a specific object and embodied the essence of that object, recognizing it as divinely made and belonging within the greater <a href="cosmos">cosmos</a>. Through acts of priestly ritual, like burning <a href="incense">incense</a>, the priest allowed spirits and deities to read the hieroglyphs decorating the surfaces of temples. In funerary texts beginning in and following the <a href="Twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth dynasty</a>, the Egyptians believed that disfiguring, and even omitting certain hieroglyphs, brought consequences, either good or bad, for a deceased tomb occupant whose spirit relied on the texts as a source of nourishment in the afterlife. Mutilating the hieroglyph of a <a href="venomous%20snake">venomous snake</a>, or other dangerous animal, removed a potential threat. However, removing every instance of the hieroglyphs representing a deceased person's name would deprive <a href="Egyptian%20soul">his or her soul</a> of the ability to read the funerary texts and condemn that soul to an inanimate existence.

Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic was used in sacred and religious texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary papyri</a> and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for <a href="scribal">scribal</a> record-keeping. Its primary purpose was to serve as a <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a> script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, <a href="Egyptian%20medicine">medical texts</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20mathematics">mathematical treatises</a>, and <a href="Sebayt">instructional guides</a>. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.

By the mid-1st millennium BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic were still used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script was used for informal, day-to-day writing: <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a>. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the <a href="Coptic%20alphabet">Coptic alphabet</a>, a revised version of the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> became the <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a> throughout the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>; hieroglyphs were discarded as <a href="Idolatry">idolatrous images</a> of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the <a href="Biblical%20canon">Biblical canon</a>.

Egyptian literature was produced on a variety of <a href="Media%20%28communication%29">media</a>. Along with the <a href="chisel">chisel</a>, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the <a href="reed%20pen">reed pen</a>, a <a href="Phragmites">reed</a> fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red <a href="ochre">ochre</a>, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>—a thin material made from beating together strips of <a href="pith">pith</a> from the "<a href="Cyperus%20papyrus">Cyperus papyrus</a>" plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone <a href="potsherd">potsherd</a>s known as <a href="ostraca">ostraca</a>. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are <a href="palimpsest">palimpsest</a>s, manuscripts that have had their original contents <a href="Eraser">erased</a> to make room for new written works. This, along with the practice of tearing pieces off of larger papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of "Cyperus papyrus". It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.

By the <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Period of Egypt</a>, the traditional Egyptian reed pen had been replaced by the chief writing tool of the <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a <a href="Nib%20%28pen%29">cut nib</a>. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek <a href="lead">lead</a>-based <a href="ink">ink</a>s. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian <a href="handwriting">handwriting</a>, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.

Underground Egyptian tombs built in the desert provide possibly the most protective environment for the preservation of papyrus documents. For example, there are many well-preserved "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a>" funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for the souls of the deceased tomb occupants. However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.

Most settlements in ancient Egypt were situated on the <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a> of the <a href="Flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">Nile floodplain</a>. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of papyrus documents. Archaeologists have discovered a larger quantity of papyrus documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain, and in settlements that lacked irrigation works, such as <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>, <a href="El-Lahun">El-Lahun</a>, and <a href="El-Hiba">El-Hiba</a>.
Writings on more permanent media have also been lost in several ways. Stones with inscriptions were frequently re-used as building materials, and ceramic ostraca require a dry environment to ensure the preservation of the ink on their surfaces. Whereas papyrus rolls and packets were usually stored in boxes for safekeeping, ostraca were routinely discarded in waste pits; one such pit was discovered by chance at the <a href="Ramesside%20Period">Ramesside-era</a> village of <a href="Deir%20el-Medina">Deir el-Medina</a>, and has yielded the majority of known private letters on ostraca. Documents found at this site include letters, hymns, fictional narratives, recipes, business receipts, and <a href="Will%20%28law%29">wills and testaments</a>. <a href="Penelope%20Wilson">Penelope Wilson</a> describes this archaeological find as the equivalent of sifting through a modern <a href="landfill">landfill</a> or <a href="waste%20container">waste container</a>. She notes that the inhabitants of Deir el-Medina were incredibly literate by ancient Egyptian standards, and cautions that such finds only come "...in rarefied circumstances and in particular conditions."

<a href="John%20W.%20Tait">John W. Tait</a> stresses, "Egyptian material survives in a very uneven fashion ... the unevenness of survival comprises both time and space." For instance, there is a dearth of written material from all periods from the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> but an abundance at western <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, dating from its heyday. He notes that while some texts were copied numerous times, others survive from a single copy; for example, there is only one complete surviving copy of the "<a href="Tale%20of%20the%20shipwrecked%20sailor">Tale of the shipwrecked sailor</a>" from the Middle Kingdom. However, "Tale of the shipwrecked sailor" also appears in fragments of texts on ostraca from the New Kingdom. Many other literary works survive only in fragments or through incomplete copies of lost originals.

Although writing first appeared during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, at the beginning of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>: <a href="Old%20Egyptian">Old Egyptian</a>. Old Egyptian remained a <a href="spoken%20language">spoken language</a> until about 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>, it evolved into <a href="Middle%20Egyptian">Middle Egyptian</a>. While Middle Egyptian was closely related to Old Egyptian, <a href="Late%20Egyptian">Late Egyptian</a> was significantly different in <a href="grammar">grammatical</a> structure. Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a <a href="vernacular%20language">vernacular language</a> as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a <a href="written%20language">written language</a> until "c". 1300 BC during the <a href="Amarna%20Period">Amarna Period</a> of the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a>. Late Egyptian evolved into <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a> by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> beginning in the 1st century AD.

Hieratic was used alongside hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom and throughout the rest of <a href="History%20of%20Ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egyptian history</a>, Middle Egyptian became a <a href="classical%20language">classical language</a> that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs and the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.

Throughout ancient Egyptian history, reading and writing were the main requirements for serving in public office, although government officials were assisted in their day-to-day work by an elite, <a href="Literacy">literate</a> social group known as <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s. As evidenced by <a href="Papyrus%20Anastasi%20I">Papyrus Anastasi I</a> of the Ramesside Period, scribes could even be expected, according to Wilson, "...to organize the excavation of a lake and the building of a brick ramp, to establish the number of men needed to transport an <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> and to arrange the provisioning of a military mission". Besides government employment, scribal services in drafting letters, sales documents, and legal documents would have been frequently sought by illiterate people. Literate people are thought to have comprised only 1% of the population, the remainder being illiterate farmers, herdsmen, artisans, and other laborers, as well as merchants who required the assistance of scribal secretaries. The privileged status of the scribe over illiterate manual laborers was the subject of a popular Ramesside Period instructional text, "<a href="The%20Satire%20of%20the%20Trades">The Satire of the Trades</a>", where lowly, undesirable occupations, for example, potter, fisherman, laundry man, and soldier, were mocked and the scribal profession praised. A similar demeaning attitude towards the illiterate is expressed in the Middle Kingdom "Teaching of Khety", which is used to reinforce the scribes' elevated position within the social hierarchy.
The scribal class was the social group responsible for maintaining, transmitting, and canonizing literary classics, and writing new compositions. Classic works, such as the "<a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>" and "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Amenemhat">Instructions of Amenemhat</a>", were copied by schoolboys as pedagogical exercises in writing and to instill the required ethical and moral values that distinguished the scribal social class. <a href="Wisdom%20texts">Wisdom texts</a> of the "<a href="sebayt">teaching</a>" genre represent the majority of pedagogical texts written on ostraca during the Middle Kingdom; narrative tales, such as "Sinuhe" and "<a href="King%20Neferkare%20and%20General%20Sasenet">King Neferkare and General Sasenet</a>", were rarely copied for school exercises until the New Kingdom. <a href="William%20Kelly%20Simpson">William Kelly Simpson</a> describes narrative tales such as "Sinuhe" and "The shipwrecked sailor" as "...instructions or teachings in the guise of narratives", since the main <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>s of such stories embodied the accepted virtues of the day, such as love of home or self-reliance.

There are some known instances where those outside the scribal profession were literate and had access to classical literature. Menena, a draughtsman working at Deir el-Medina during the <a href="Twentieth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth dynasty of Egypt</a>, quoted passages from the Middle Kingdom narratives "<a href="Eloquent%20Peasant">Eloquent Peasant</a>" and "<a href="Tale%20of%20the%20shipwrecked%20sailor">Tale of the shipwrecked sailor</a>" in an instructional letter reprimanding his disobedient son. Menena's Ramesside contemporary Hori, the scribal author of the <a href="Satire">satirical</a> letter in Papyrus Anastasi I, admonished his addressee for quoting the "<a href="Instruction%20of%20Hardjedef">Instruction of Hardjedef</a>" in the unbecoming manner of a non-scribal, semi-educated person. <a href="Hans-Werner%20Fischer-Elfert">Hans-Werner Fischer-Elfert</a> further explains this perceived amateur affront to orthodox literature:

What may be revealed by Hori's attack on the way in which some Ramesside scribes felt obliged to demonstrate their greater or lesser acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in full and not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past. The classics of the time were to be memorized completely and comprehended thoroughly before being cited.

There is limited but solid evidence in Egyptian literature and <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">art</a> for the practice of oral reading of texts to audiences. The oral performance word "to recite" ("šdj") was usually associated with <a href="biographies">biographies</a>, letters, and spells. Singing ("ḥsj") was meant for praise songs, <a href="love%20song">love song</a>s, funerary <a href="lament">lament</a>s, and certain spells. <a href="Discourse">Discourse</a>s such as the "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Neferti">Prophecy of Neferti</a>" suggest that compositions were meant for oral reading among elite gatherings. In the 1st millennium BC Demotic <a href="short%20story%20cycle">short story cycle</a> centered on the deeds of <a href="Petiese">Petiese</a>, the stories begin with the phrase "The voice which is before Pharaoh", which indicates that an oral speaker and audience was involved in the reading of the text. A fictional audience of high government officials and members of the royal court are mentioned in some texts, but a wider, non-literate audience may have been involved. For example, a funerary stela of <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> (r. 1971–1926 BC) explicitly mentions people who will gather and listen to a scribe who "recites" the stela inscriptions out loud.

Literature also served religious purposes. Beginning with the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>" of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, and later on <a href="Coffin%20Texts">coffins</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">papyri</a> placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, <a href="incantation">incantation</a>s, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

Although the creation of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works are thought to have been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, <a href="Edward%20F.%20Wente">Edward F. Wente</a> asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.

<a href="Richard%20B.%20Parkinson">Richard B. Parkinson</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20D.%20Morenz">Ludwig D. Morenz</a> write that ancient Egyptian literature—narrowly defined as "<a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a>" ("beautiful writing")—was not recorded in written form until the early Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. Old Kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults, preserve souls in the afterlife, and document accounts for practical uses in daily life. It was not until the Middle Kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity. Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works of the Middle Kingdom were transcriptions of the <a href="oral%20literature">oral literature</a> of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers' songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.

Dating texts by methods of <a href="palaeography">palaeography</a>, the study of handwriting, is problematic because of differing styles of hieratic script. The use of <a href="orthography">orthography</a>, the study of writing systems and symbol usage, is also problematic, since some texts' authors may have copied the characteristic style of an older <a href="archetype">archetype</a>. Fictional accounts were often set in remote historical settings, the use of contemporary settings in fiction being a relatively recent phenomenon. The style of a text provides little help in determining an exact date for its composition, as genre and authorial choice might be more concerned with the mood of a text than the era in which it was written. For example, authors of the Middle Kingdom could set fictional <a href="wisdom%20texts">wisdom texts</a> in the <a href="golden%20age">golden age</a> of the Old Kingdom (e.g. "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Kagemni">Kagemni</a>", "Ptahhotep", and the prologue of "Neferti"), or they could write fictional accounts placed in a chaotic age resembling more the problematic life of the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">First Intermediate Period</a> (e.g. "<a href="Teaching%20for%20King%20Merykare">Merykare</a>" and "The Eloquent Peasant"). Other fictional texts are set (in an indeterminable era) and usually contain timeless themes.

Parkinson writes that nearly all literary texts were <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ous, and frequently falsely attributed to well-known male protagonists of earlier history, such as <a href="Pharaoh">kings</a> and <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">viziers</a>. Only the literary genres of "teaching" and "laments/discourses" contain works attributed to historical authors; texts in genres such as "narrative tales" were never attributed to a well-known historical person. Tait asserts that during the Classical Period of Egypt, "Egyptian scribes constructed their own view of the history of the role of scribes and of the 'authorship' of texts", but during the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a>, this role was instead maintained by the religious elite attached to the temples.

There are a few exceptions to the rule of pseudonymity. The real authors of some Ramesside Period teaching texts were acknowledged, but these cases are rare, localized, and do not typify mainstream works. Those who wrote private and sometimes model letters were acknowledged as the original authors. Private letters could be used in courts of law as testimony, since a person's unique handwriting could be identified as authentic. Private letters received or written by the pharaoh were sometimes inscribed in hieroglyphics on stone monuments to celebrate kingship, while kings' decrees inscribed on were often made public.

Modern Egyptologists categorize Egyptian texts into <a href="genre">genre</a>s, for example "<a href="lament">lament</a>s/<a href="discourse">discourse</a>s" and narrative tales. The only genre of literature named as such by the ancient Egyptians was the "teaching" or "<a href="sebayt">sebayt</a>" genre. Parkinson states that the titles of a work, its opening statement, or key words found in the body of text should be used as indicators of its particular genre. Only the genre of "narrative tales" employed <a href="prose">prose</a>, yet many of the works of that genre, as well as those of other genres, were written in <a href="Verse%20%28poetry%29">verse</a>. Most ancient Egyptian verses were written in <a href="couplet">couplet</a> form, but sometimes <a href="Tercet">triplets</a> and <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>s were used.

The "instructions" or "teaching" genre, as well as the genre of "reflective discourses", can be grouped in the larger corpus of <a href="wisdom%20literature">wisdom literature</a> found in the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>. The genre is <a href="didactic">didactic</a> in nature and is thought to have formed part of the Middle Kingdom scribal education <a href="syllabus">syllabus</a>. However, teaching texts often incorporate narrative elements that can instruct as well as entertain. Parkinson asserts that there is evidence that teaching texts were not created primarily for use in scribal education, but for ideological purposes. For example, <a href="Adolf%20Erman">Adolf Erman</a> (1854–1937) writes that the fictional instruction given by <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> (r. 1991–1962 BC) to his sons "...far exceeds the bounds of school philosophy, and there is nothing whatever to do with school in a great warning his children to be loyal to the king". While narrative literature, embodied in works such as "The Eloquent Peasant", emphasize the individual hero who challenges society and its accepted ideologies, the teaching texts instead stress the need to comply with society's accepted dogmas.

Key words found in teaching texts include "to know" ("rḫ") and "to teach" ("sbꜣ"). These texts usually adopt the formulaic title structure of "the instruction of X made for Y", where "X" can be represented by an authoritative figure (such as a <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a> or <a href="pharaoh">king</a>) providing moral guidance to his son(s). It is sometimes difficult to determine how many fictional addressees are involved in these teachings, since some texts switch between singular and plural when referring to their audiences.

Examples of the "teaching" genre include the "<a href="Maxims%20of%20Ptahhotep">Maxims of Ptahhotep</a>", "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Kagemni">Instructions of Kagemni</a>", "<a href="Teaching%20for%20King%20Merykare">Teaching for King Merykare</a>", "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Amenemhat">Instructions of Amenemhat</a>", "<a href="Instruction%20of%20Hardjedef">Instruction of Hardjedef</a>", "<a href="Loyalist%20Teaching">Loyalist Teaching</a>", and "<a href="Instructions%20of%20Amenemope">Instructions of Amenemope</a>". Teaching texts that have survived from the Middle Kingdom were written on papyrus manuscripts. No educational ostraca from the Middle Kingdom have survived. The earliest schoolboy's wooden writing board, with a copy of a teaching text (i.e. "Ptahhotep"), dates to the <a href="Eighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth dynasty</a>. "Ptahhotep" and "Kagemni" are both found on the <a href="Prisse%20Papyrus">Prisse Papyrus</a>, which was written during the Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. The entire "Loyalist Teaching" survives only in manuscripts from the New Kingdom, although the entire first half is preserved on a Middle Kingdom biographical stone stela commemorating the <a href="Twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth dynasty</a> official Sehetepibre. "Merykare", "Amenemhat", and "Hardjedef" are genuine Middle Kingdom works, but only survive in later New Kingdom copies. "Amenemope" is a New Kingdom compilation.

The genre of "tales and stories" is probably the least represented genre from surviving literature of the Middle Kingdom and Middle Egyptian. In Late Egyptian literature, "tales and stories" comprise the majority of surviving literary works dated from the <a href="Ramesside%20Period">Ramesside Period</a> of the New Kingdom into the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a>. Major narrative works from the Middle Kingdom include the "<a href="Westcar%20Papyrus">Tale of the Court of King Cheops</a>", "<a href="King%20Neferkare%20and%20General%20Sasenet">King Neferkare and General Sasenet</a>", "<a href="The%20Eloquent%20Peasant">The Eloquent Peasant</a>", "<a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>", and "<a href="Tale%20of%20the%20shipwrecked%20sailor">Tale of the shipwrecked sailor</a>". The New Kingdom corpus of tales includes the "Quarrel of Apepi and Seqenenre", "<a href="Taking%20of%20Joppa">Taking of Joppa</a>", "<a href="Tale%20of%20the%20doomed%20prince">Tale of the doomed prince</a>", "<a href="Tale%20of%20Two%20Brothers">Tale of Two Brothers</a>", and the "<a href="Report%20of%20Wenamun">Report of Wenamun</a>". Stories from the 1st millennium BC written in Demotic include the story of the <a href="Famine%20Stela">Famine Stela</a> (set in the Old Kingdom, although written during the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>) and <a href="short%20story%20cycle">short story cycle</a>s of the Ptolemaic and <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman</a> periods that transform well-known historical figures such as <a href="Khaemweset">Khaemweset</a> (<a href="Nineteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth Dynasty</a>) and <a href="Inaros%20II">Inaros</a> (<a href="History%20of%20Persian%20Egypt">First Persian Period</a>) into fictional, legendary heroes. This is contrasted with many stories written in Late Egyptian, whose authors frequently chose divinities as protagonists and mythological places as settings.

Parkinson defines tales as "...non-commemorative, non-functional, fictional <a href="narrative">narrative</a>s" that usually employ the key word "narrate" ("sdd"). He describes it as the most open-ended genre, since the tales often incorporate elements of other literary genres. For example, Morenz describes the opening section of the foreign adventure tale "Sinuhe" as a "...funerary self-presentation" that parodies the typical <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> found on commemorative funerary . The autobiography is for a <a href="courier">courier</a> whose service began under Amenemhat I. Simpson states that the death of Amenemhat I in the report given by his son, <a href="coregent">coregent</a>, and successor <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> (r. 1971–1926 BC) to the army in the beginning of "Sinuhe" is "...excellent propaganda". Morenz describes "The shipwrecked sailor" as an expeditionary report and a travel-narrative myth. Simpson notes the literary device of the <a href="story%20within%20a%20story">story within a story</a> in "The shipwrecked sailor" may provide "...the earliest examples of a narrative <a href="quarry">quarry</a>ing report". With the setting of a magical desert island, and a character who is a talking snake, "The shipwrecked sailor" may also be classified as a <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>. While stories like "Sinuhe", "Taking of Joppa", and the "Doomed prince" contain fictional portrayals of Egyptians abroad, the "Report of Wenamun" is most likely based on a true account of an Egyptian who traveled to <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> in <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> to obtain <a href="Cedrus%20libani">cedar</a> for <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> during the reign of <a href="Ramesses%20XI">Ramesses XI</a>.

Narrative tales and stories are most often found on papyri, but partial and sometimes complete texts are found on ostraca. For example, "Sinuhe" is found on five papyri composed during the <a href="Twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth</a> and <a href="Thirteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirteenth</a> dynasties. This text was later copied numerous times on ostraca during the <a href="Nineteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth</a> and <a href="Twentieth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth</a> dynasties, with one ostraca containing the complete text on both sides.

The Middle Kingdom genre of "<a href="Prophecy">prophetic texts</a>", also known as "<a href="lament">lament</a>s", "<a href="discourse">discourse</a>s", "<a href="dialogue">dialogue</a>s", and "apocalyptic literature", include such works as the "<a href="Admonitions%20of%20Ipuwer">Admonitions of Ipuwer</a>", "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Neferti">Prophecy of Neferti</a>", and "<a href="Dispute%20between%20a%20man%20and%20his%20Ba">Dispute between a man and his Ba</a>". This genre had no known precedent in the Old Kingdom and no known original compositions were produced in the New Kingdom. However, works like "Prophecy of Neferti" were frequently copied during the Ramesside Period of the New Kingdom, when this Middle Kingdom genre was canonized but discontinued. Egyptian prophetic literature underwent a revival during the Greek <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> and <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman period of Egypt</a> with works such as the "<a href="Demotic%20Chronicle">Demotic Chronicle</a>", "<a href="Oracle%20of%20the%20Lamb">Oracle of the Lamb</a>", "<a href="Oracle%20of%20the%20Potter">Oracle of the Potter</a>", and two prophetic texts that focus on <a href="Nectanebo%20II">Nectanebo II</a> (r. 360–343 BC) as a protagonist. Along with "teaching" texts, these reflective discourses (key word "mdt") are grouped with the wisdom literature category of the ancient Near East.

In Middle Kingdom texts, connecting themes include a pessimistic outlook, descriptions of social and religious change, and great disorder throughout the land, taking the form of a <a href="syntax">syntactic</a> "then-now" verse formula. Although these texts are usually described as laments, "Neferti" digresses from this model, providing a positive solution to a problematic world. Although it survives only in later copies from the <a href="Eighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth dynasty</a> onward, Parkinson asserts that, due to obvious political content, "Neferti" was originally written during or shortly after the reign of Amenemhat I. Simpson calls it "...a blatant political pamphlet designed to support the new regime" of the Twelfth dynasty founded by Amenemhat, who usurped the throne from the <a href="Mentuhotep%20IV">Mentuhotep</a> line of the <a href="Eleventh%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eleventh dynasty</a>. In the narrative discourse, <a href="Sneferu">Sneferu</a> (r. 2613–2589 BC) of the <a href="Fourth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth dynasty</a> summons to court the sage and lector priest Neferti. Neferti entertains the king with prophecies that the land will enter into a chaotic age, alluding to the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a>, only to be restored to its former glory by a righteous king— Ameny—whom the ancient Egyptian would readily recognize as Amenemhat I. A similar model of a tumultuous world transformed into a golden age by a savior king was adopted for the "Lamb" and "Potter", although for their audiences living under Roman domination, the savior was yet to come.

Although written during the Twelfth dynasty, "Ipuwer" only survives from a <a href="Nineteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth dynasty</a> papyrus. However, "A man and his Ba" is found on an original Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In "Ipuwer", a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either as a warning to kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In "A man and his Ba", a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his "ba" (a component of the <a href="Egyptian%20soul">Egyptian soul</a>) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.

The funerary stone <a href="slab%20stela">slab stela</a> was first produced during the early Old Kingdom. Usually found in <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> tombs, they combined <a href="raised-relief">raised-relief</a> artwork with inscriptions bearing the name of the deceased, their official titles (if any), and <a href="invocation">invocation</a>s.

Funerary poems were thought to preserve a monarch's soul in death. The <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a> are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating <a href="Poetry">poetic</a> verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of <a href="Unas">Unas</a> (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Unas">Pyramid of Unas</a> built at <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a>. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing the soul of the sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a> of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a>", "<a href="Litany%20of%20Ra">Litany of Ra</a>", and "<a href="Amduat">Amduat</a>" written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.

Poems were also written to celebrate kingship. For example, at the <a href="Precinct%20of%20Amun-Re">Precinct of Amun-Re</a> at <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a>, <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> (r. 1479–1425 BC) of the Eighteenth dynasty erected a stela commemorating his military victories in which the gods bless Thutmose in poetic verse and ensure for him victories over his enemies. In addition to stone stelas, poems have been found on wooden writing boards used by schoolboys. Besides the glorification of kings, poems were written to honor various <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">deities</a>, and even the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>.

Surviving hymns and songs from the Old Kingdom include the morning greeting hymns to the gods in their respective temples. A cycle of Middle-Kingdom songs dedicated to <a href="Senusret%20III">Senusret III</a> (r. 1878–1839 BC) have been discovered at <a href="El-Lahun">El-Lahun</a>. Erman considers these to be secular songs used to greet the pharaoh at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, while Simpson considers them to be religious in nature but affirms that the division between religious and secular songs is not very sharp. The <a href="Harper%27s%20Song">Harper's Song</a>, the lyrics found on a tombstone of the Middle Kingdom and on <a href="Papyrus%20Harris%20500">Papyrus Harris 500</a> from the New Kingdom, was to be performed for dinner guests at formal banquets.

During the reign of <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> (r. 1353–1336 BC), the <a href="Great%20Hymn%20to%20the%20Aten">Great Hymn to the Aten</a>—preserved in tombs of <a href="Amarna">Amarna</a>, including <a href="Southern%20Tomb%2025">the tomb</a> of <a href="Ay">Ay</a>—was written to the <a href="Aten">Aten</a>, the sun-disk deity given <a href="Atenism">exclusive patronage</a> during his reign. Simpson compares this composition's wording and sequence of ideas to those of <a href="Psalm%20104">Psalm 104</a>.

Only a single poetic hymn in the Demotic script has been preserved. However, there are many surviving examples of Late-Period Egyptian hymns written in hieroglyphs on temple walls.

No Egyptian <a href="love%20song">love song</a> has been dated from before the New Kingdom, these being written in Late Egyptian, although it is speculated that they existed in previous times. Erman compares the love songs to the <a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>, citing the labels "sister" and "brother" that lovers used to address each other.

The ancient Egyptian model letters and <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s are grouped into a single literary genre. Papyrus rolls sealed with mud stamps were used for long-distance letters, while ostraca were frequently used to write shorter, non-confidential letters sent to recipients located nearby. Letters of royal or official correspondence, originally written in hieratic, were sometimes given the exalted status of being inscribed on stone in hieroglyphs. The various texts written by schoolboys on wooden writing boards include model letters. Private letters could be used as epistolary model letters for schoolboys to copy, including letters written by their teachers or their families. However, these models were rarely featured in educational manuscripts; instead fictional letters found in numerous manuscripts were used. The common epistolary formula used in these model letters was "The official A. saith to the scribe B".

The oldest-known <a href="Letter%20%28message%29">private letters</a> on papyrus were found in a funerary temple dating to the reign of <a href="Djedkare-Izezi">Djedkare-Izezi</a> (r. 2414–2375 BC) of the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth dynasty</a>. More letters are dated to the <a href="Sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth dynasty</a>, when the epistle subgenre began. The educational text "Book of Kemit", dated to the <a href="Eleventh%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eleventh dynasty</a>, contains a list of epistolary greetings and a narrative with an ending in letter form and suitable terminology for use in commemorative <a href="biographies">biographies</a>. Other letters of the early Middle Kingdom have also been found to use epistolary formulas similar to the "Book of Kemit". The <a href="Heqanakht%20papyri">Heqanakht papyri</a>, written by a gentleman farmer, date to the Eleventh dynasty and represent some of the lengthiest private letters known to have been written in ancient Egypt.

During the late Middle Kingdom, greater standardization of the epistolary formula can be seen, for example in a series of model letters taken from dispatches sent to the <a href="Semna%20%28Nubia%29">Semna fortress</a> of <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> during the reign of <a href="Amenemhat%20III">Amenemhat III</a> (r. 1860–1814 BC). Epistles were also written during all three dynasties of the New Kingdom. While letters to the dead had been written since the Old Kingdom, the writing of petition letters in epistolary form to deities began in the Ramesside Period, becoming very popular during the <a href="History%20of%20Persian%20Egypt">Persian</a> and <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Ptolemaic</a> periods.

The epistolary "Satirical Letter" of <a href="Papyrus%20Anastasi%20I">Papyrus Anastasi I</a> written during the <a href="Nineteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth dynasty</a> was a pedagogical and didactic text copied on numerous ostraca by schoolboys. Wente describes the versatility of this epistle, which contained "...proper greetings with wishes for this life and the next, the rhetoric composition, interpretation of <a href="aphorism">aphorism</a>s in wisdom literature, <a href="Egyptian%20mathematics">application of mathematics</a> to <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">engineering problems</a> and the calculation of supplies for an army, and the geography of <a href="western%20Asia">western Asia</a>". Moreover, Wente calls this a "...polemical tractate" that counsels against the rote, mechanical learning of terms for places, professions, and things; for example, it is not acceptable to know just the place names of western Asia, but also important details about its <a href="topography">topography</a> and routes. To enhance the teaching, the text employs sarcasm and irony.

Catherine Parke, Professor Emerita of English and Women's Studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Missouri">University of Missouri</a> in <a href="Columbia%2C%20Missouri">Columbia, Missouri</a>, writes that the earliest "commemorative inscriptions" belong to ancient Egypt and date to the 3rd millennium BC. She writes: "In ancient Egypt the formulaic accounts of Pharaoh's lives praised the continuity of dynastic power. Although typically written in the first person, these pronouncements are public, general testimonials, not personal utterances." She adds that as in these ancient inscriptions, the human urge to "...celebrate, commemorate, and immortalize, the impulse of life against death", is the aim of <a href="biographies">biographies</a> written today.

Olivier Perdu, a professor of <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> at the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>, states that biographies did not exist in ancient Egypt, and that commemorative writing should be considered <a href="autobiographies">autobiographical</a>. Edward L. Greenstein, Professor of Bible at the <a href="Tel%20Aviv%20University">Tel Aviv University</a> and <a href="Bar-Ilan%20University">Bar-Ilan University</a>, disagrees with Perdu's terminology, stating that the ancient world produced no "autobiographies" in the modern sense, and these should be distinguished from 'autobiographical' texts of the ancient world. However, both Perdu and Greenstein assert that autobiographies of the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a> should not be equated with the modern concept of autobiography.

In her discussion of the "<a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>" of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, Jennifer Koosed, associate professor of Religion at <a href="Albright%20College">Albright College</a>, explains that there is no solid consensus among scholars as to whether true biographies or autobiographies existed in the ancient world. One of the major scholarly arguments against this theory is that the concept of <a href="individual">individual</a>ity did not exist until the European <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, prompting Koosed to write "...thus autobiography is made a product of European civilization: <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a> begat <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Rosseau</a> begat <a href="Henry%20Brooks%20Adams">Henry Adams</a>, and so on". Koosed asserts that the use of first-person "I" in ancient Egyptian commemorative funerary texts should not be taken literally since the supposed author is already dead. Funerary texts should be considered biographical instead of autobiographical. Koosed cautions that the term "biography" applied to such texts is problematic, since they also usually describe the deceased person's experiences of journeying through the <a href="Duat">afterlife</a>.

Beginning with the funerary stelas for officials of the late <a href="Third%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third dynasty</a>, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, it was not until the <a href="Sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth dynasty</a> that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a>s of ancient Greece.

Modern historians consider that some biographical—or autobiographical—texts are important historical documents. For example, the biographical stelas of military generals in tomb chapels built under Thutmose III provide much of the information known about the wars in <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. However, the <a href="annal">annal</a>s of Thutmose III, carved into the walls of several monuments built during his reign, such as those at Karnak, also preserve information about these campaigns. The annals of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> (r. 1279–1213 BC), recounting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kadesh">Battle of Kadesh</a> against the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Hittites">Hittites</a> include, for the first time in Egyptian literature, a narrative <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a>, distinguished from all earlier poetry, which served to celebrate and instruct.

Other documents useful for investigating Egyptian history are ancient found in terse <a href="chronicle">chronicle</a>s, such as the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth dynasty</a> <a href="Palermo%20stone">Palermo stone</a>. These documents legitimated the contemporary pharaoh's claim to sovereignty. Throughout ancient Egyptian history, royal <a href="decree">decree</a>s recounted the deeds of ruling pharaohs. For example, the <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>n pharaoh <a href="Piye">Piye</a> (r. 752–721 BC), founder of the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-fifth dynasty</a>, had a stela erected and written in classical Middle Egyptian that describes with unusual nuances and vivid imagery his successful military campaigns.

An Egyptian historian, known by his Greek name as <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a> ("c". 3rd century BC), was the first to compile a <a href="Historiography">comprehensive history</a> of Egypt. Manetho was active during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (r. 283–246 BC) and used "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">The Histories</a>" by the Greek <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> ("c". 484 BC–"c". 425 BC) as his main source of inspiration for a history of Egypt written in Greek. However, the primary sources for Manetho's work were the king list chronicles of previous Egyptian dynasties.

Fischer-Elfert distinguishes ancient Egyptian <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> writing as a literary genre. During the New Kingdom, scribes who traveled to ancient sites often left graffiti messages on the walls of sacred <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>s and <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a>, usually in commemoration of these structures. Modern scholars do not consider these scribes to have been mere <a href="tourist">tourist</a>s, but <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a>s visiting sacred sites where the extinct cult centers could be used for communicating with the gods. There is evidence from an educational ostracon found in the tomb of <a href="Senenmut">Senenmut</a> (<a href="TT71">TT71</a>) that formulaic graffiti writing was practiced in scribal schools. In one graffiti message, left at the mortuary temple of Thutmose III at <a href="Deir%20el-Bahri">Deir el-Bahri</a>, a modified saying from "<a href="The%20Maxims%20of%20Ptahhotep">The Maxims of Ptahhotep</a>" is incorporated into a prayer written on the temple wall. Scribes usually wrote their graffiti in separate clusters to distinguish their graffiti from others'. This led to competition among scribes, who would sometimes denigrate the quality of graffiti inscribed by others, even ancestors from the scribal profession.

After the <a href="Copt">Copt</a>s converted to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the first centuries AD, their <a href="Coptic%20Christian">Coptic Christian</a> literature became separated from the pharaonic and <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> literary traditions. Nevertheless, scholars speculate that ancient Egyptian literature, perhaps in oral form, influenced <a href="Greek%20literature">Greek</a> and <a href="Arabic%20literature">Arabic literature</a>. Parallels are drawn between the Egyptian soldiers sneaking into <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> hidden in baskets to capture the city in the story "Taking of Joppa" and the <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>an Greeks sneaking into <a href="Troy">Troy</a> inside the <a href="Trojan%20Horse">Trojan Horse</a>. The "Taking of Joppa" has also been compared to the Arabic story of <a href="Ali%20Baba">Ali Baba</a> in "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">One Thousand and One Nights</a>". It has been conjectured that "<a href="Sinbad%20the%20Sailor">Sinbad the Sailor</a>" may have been inspired by the pharaonic "Tale of the shipwrecked sailor". Some Egyptian literature was commented on by scholars of the ancient world. For example, the Jewish Roman historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> (37–"c". 100 AD) quoted and provided commentary on Manetho's historical texts.

The most recently carved hieroglyphic inscription of ancient Egypt known today is found in a temple of <a href="Philae">Philae</a>, dated precisely to 394 AD during the reign of <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> (r. 379–395 AD). In the 4th century AD, the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenized</a> Egyptian <a href="Horapollo">Horapollo</a> compiled a survey of almost two hundred Egyptian hieroglyphs and provided his interpretation of their meanings, although his understanding was limited and he was unaware of the phonetic uses of each hieroglyph. This survey was apparently lost until 1415, when the Italian <a href="Cristoforo%20Buondelmonti">Cristoforo Buondelmonti</a> acquired it at the island of <a href="Andros">Andros</a>. <a href="Athanasius%20Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a> (1601–1680) was the first in Europe to realize that <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> was a direct linguistic descendant of ancient Egyptian. In his "<a href="Oedipus%20Aegyptiacus">Oedipus Aegyptiacus</a>", he made the first concerted European effort to interpret the meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs, albeit based on symbolic inferences.

It was not until 1799, with the <a href="Napoleonic%20Campaign%20in%20Egypt">Napoleonic discovery</a> of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>, that modern scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Champollion">Jean-François Champollion</a> (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm <a href="The%20Bible%20and%20history">Biblical events</a>.

Before the 1970s, scholarly consensus was that ancient Egyptian literature—although sharing similarities with modern literary categories—was not an independent discourse, uninfluenced by the ancient sociopolitical order. However, from the 1970s onwards, a growing number of historians and literary scholars have questioned this theory. While scholars before the 1970s treated ancient Egyptian literary works as viable historical sources that accurately reflected the conditions of this ancient society, scholars now caution against this approach. Scholars are increasingly using a multifaceted <a href="hermeneutic">hermeneutic</a> approach to the study of individual literary works, in which not only the style and content, but also the cultural, social and historical context of the work are taken into account. Individual works can then be used as <a href="case%20studies">case studies</a> for reconstructing the main features of ancient Egyptian literary discourse.

Conan (2007 video game)

Conan is a <a href="2007%20in%20video%20gaming">2007</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game that puts players in control of the titular hero, <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a>, from <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>'s fantasy literature. The game was published by <a href="THQ">THQ</a> for the game consoles. Its developer, <a href="Nihilistic%20Software">Nihilistic Software</a>, was inspired by the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28video%20game%29">God of War</a>" and "<a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%282004%20video%20game%29">Ninja Gaiden</a>" video games to create an experience featuring gore and nudity.

In "Conan", the hero is on a quest to recover his lost armor and defeat an evil wizard. Conan can fight with sword and shield, two-handed weapons, or a weapon in each hand. Starting with several basic attacks, the barbarian gains <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s by killing enemies. By exchanging these points for additional attacks, players improve the hero's fighting abilities. <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">Magic powers</a> complement Conan's arsenal, including the abilities to turn enemies into stone and conjure firestorms. The game also features <a href="Quick%20Time%20Event">context-sensitive action sequences</a> in which players press a sequence of buttons displayed on the screen to complete actions such as killing powerful enemies and interacting with the environment.

Critics enjoyed "Conan"s combat system and gory kills, but said that the game failed to match the experience offered in "God of War". Reactions varied on the game's depiction of the Conan universe; several critics praised the emulation of <a href="Frank%20Frazetta">Frank Frazetta</a>'s famous artwork, but others found the game's graphics drab and of low resolution. Regarding the audio, <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a>-winning actor <a href="Ron%20Perlman">Ron Perlman</a> was both praised and criticized for his voice work as Conan. Composer <a href="Mike%20Reagan">Mike Reagan</a> received acclaim for the game's music and later gave live performances of the game's soundtrack at <a href="Video%20Games%20Live">Video Games Live</a> shows. Despite the average reviews and commercial success of the Conan franchise, "Conan" sold poorly and was a financial loss for THQ.

Players control <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> from a <a href="Third-person%20shooter">third-person</a> perspective while attempting to advance through the series of <a href="Level%20%28computer%20and%20video%20games%29">level</a>s that subdivide the game. The gameplay is the same for each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a <a href="boss%20%28video%20game%29">boss</a>. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an <a href="Quick%20Time%20Event">interactive button-pressing sequence</a> that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of <a href="Jumping%20puzzle">platforming sequences</a> in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can <a href="Saved%20game">save their progress</a> by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.
Conan starts each level with his default one-handed sword, and can pick up shields and other weapons to switch between three styles of attack: fighting with a one-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or a weapon in each hand. Each style features several attacks with names like "Cimmerian Charge" and "Black River Rage". The barbarian can change or stop his attacks at any time, creating many options in combat. When Conan lands a sequence of successive hits on his enemies, he activates his Song of Death, which increases the damage of his attacks for a short time. For defense, Conan can roll under enemy attacks or block them. If the player presses the block button just when an enemy is about to hit the barbarian, an image of a controller button appears on the screen. Pressing the button shown will make Conan execute a gory counterattack, which instantly kills the enemy. Other methods to kill enemies include grabbing and throwing them against other objects, such as spikes and other enemies, or over cliffs.

In addition to physical assaults, Conan can use <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magic powers</a> to damage enemies. Gaining these powers in later stages of the game, the barbarian can turn opponents into stone, call down fire from the heavens, and summon flocks of ravens to do his bidding. These magical attacks can quickly end fights, but their use is limited by the number of <a href="magic%20point">magic point</a>s Conan has. When an enemy is killed, colored runes—each one conferring its own special advantage—are released and gathered by the barbarian. Red runes act as <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s, which are exchanged for advanced attacks. Green and blue runes restore Conan's <a href="Health%20%28game%20mechanic%29">health</a> and magic points, respectively. The barbarian can also obtain runes by breaking containers and freeing maidens from captivity.

In "Conan", the hero is on a quest to recover his lost armor and defeat an evil wizard. The game takes place in the world of <a href="Hyborian%20Age">Hyboria</a>, a creation of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> for his stories about Conan the Barbarian. "Conan"s developer, <a href="Nihilistic%20Software">Nihilistic Software</a>, chose several Hyborian locations, such as Kush, Stygia, and the Barachan Isles, to establish a link to the literary world. Hyboria was designed to be a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> version of Earth around , and its civilizations were based on those from the <a href="Three-age%20system">Stone to Iron Ages</a>. Nihilistic portrayed the plains of Kush, a fictional <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, as <a href="savanna">savanna</a>hs with villages of straw huts. Stygia was illustrated as a land filled with structures resembling <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> tombs and the Barachan Isles as lushly jungled islands.

Conan is the protagonist in many of Howard's stories: a franchise has been built around the character, and <a href="Frank%20Frazetta">Frank Frazetta</a>'s paintings have further elevated the barbarian's profile in <a href="Popular%20culture">pop culture</a>. Howard presented his barbarian hero as a strong, shrewd, barbaric, and ambitious man in a primitive world of magic. His stories are simple and portray Conan overcoming a series of obstacles to defeat the antagonists with his physical prowess. Nihilistic originally intended to stay faithful to the literature, but the writers strayed from the <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> by showing the barbarian as willing to use magic. The literary Conan abhors magic, but Nihilistic reasoned that, in order to restore his armor to its original non-magical state, he is willing to use the magic it has been cursed with.

The developers did, however, stay true to the physical depictions of the barbarian. Reflecting how fights are described in the stories, players can kill foes in the goriest manner—dismembering and disemboweling them. Nihilistic wanted to show that the brutal killings are considered natural by Conan and not executed out of a thirst for blood. The inspiration for Conan's moves came from several sources, but mostly from Frazetta's artwork. The animators took several of Conan's poses straight from the paintings and modeled his movements after those of the characters in the feature animation "<a href="Tarzan%20%281999%20film%29">Tarzan</a>" and the action films "<a href="Troy%20%28film%29">Troy</a>" and "<a href="Ong%20Bak">Ong Bak</a>". The names of several fighting techniques such as "Gwahlur's Leap", "Bel's Gambit", and "Camel Punch" were also based on names and events from the "Conan" stories and films. To garner extra publicity, the publisher <a href="THQ">THQ</a> hired <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a>-winning actor <a href="Ron%20Perlman">Ron Perlman</a> to provide the voice for Conan.

Typical "Conan" stories by Howard featured leading females who were occasionally <a href="Damsel%20in%20distress">damsels in distress</a>. However, they were also strong and fearless women who would rescue the hero at crucial moments. Nihilistic cast the game's leading female character, A'kanna, in this mold; the warrior queen and Conan aid each other in several parts of the game. By contrast, there are <a href="Toplessness">topless</a>, chained-up women scattered across the game's levels. However, these are only in the game because of the developer's belief that nudity was integral to a "Conan" story. Showing their breasts and acting in a <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> manner, these damsels-in-distress reward players with red runes when rescued.

Howard's short story, "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Black%20Coast">Queen of the Black Coast</a>", served as the inspiration for the game's plot. In the short story, Conan has a brief romance with <a href="B%C3%AAlit%20%28Robert%20E.%20Howard%29">Bêlit</a>, a pirate queen. Near the end of the story a demonic creature kills Bêlit and Conan seeks revenge. The creature, however, is stronger than Conan, overpowers him, and is about to kill him when Bêlit's spirit startles it and inspires Conan to kill the beast. The game's story follows a similar theme with A'kanna in the role of Bêlit. Told as a campfire story, <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s—in the form of static artwork or animation <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendered</a> by the game engine—open and close each level with narratives from an elderly A'kanna.

The story starts at Parad Isle where Conan is raiding a tomb. Instead of finding treasure, he unknowingly frees Graven, a wizard who had been confined in a magical prison for his transgressions. Showing no gratitude, the wizard curses Conan's armor, scatters it across the world, and teleports the barbarian away. Vowing to retrieve his armor, Conan meets A'kanna while he is fighting through a <a href="Piracy">pirate</a> base. Teaming up with the barbarian to find his armor, the warrior queen hopes to use its magic to end the curse—the Black Death—that is causing her people to kill each other. Their quest leads players through several locations and boss creatures such as <a href="dragon">dragon</a>s, <a href="undead">undead</a> elephants, and <a href="kraken">kraken</a>s. <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">Flashback</a>s are shown when retrieving a piece of armor after killing certain bosses; these <a href="back-story">back-stories</a> tell of Graven's imprisonment of the gods, his plan to sacrifice his daughter A'kanna, and his creation of the Black Death to transform the world to his liking.

In the last level, Conan has retrieved all of his armor and returns to Parad Isle to rescue A'kanna from her father. After a long boss fight and several button-pressing sequences, Conan slays the wizard at the bottom of the ocean. Graven's defeat frees the gods he had imprisoned, and they bring him back to life for eternal punishment. The story ends with the separation of the barbarian and the warrior queen. Conan goes on to fulfill his destiny to be a king as written in Howard's stories. A'kanna, however, grows old in a village, telling stories to children and never forgetting Conan.

In 2005, THQ acquired the rights to produce a series of video games featuring Conan the Barbarian and the world of Hyboria. This news came to the attention of Nihilistic Software who had just completed the action game "". The <a href="video%20game%20developer">video game developer</a> was looking to develop an action game similar to "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28video%20game%29">God of War</a>" for its next project and saw the world of Conan as a good setting. The team quickly built a prototype to demonstrate its concept to THQ and received approval for the project. The video game publisher officially announced the game to the industry on February 26, 2007.

Nihilistic decided to use the features of other action games for "Conan". While "God of War" was its inspiration for the <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a>, "<a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%282004%20video%20game%29">Ninja Gaiden</a>" was a great influence on the combat engine. The team wanted to emulate the complexity of "Ninja Gaiden"s combat system, with many attacking options and an equal emphasis on being alert to the actions of enemies. Nihilistic also wanted the game to appeal to <a href="button%20mashing">button mashing</a> players as well as those who want to control their character with finesse. In addition, it designed the game to increase the frequency and difficulty of encounters as players advance through the levels.

"Conan" was developed to be released on the . Although the architectures of the two consoles were very different, Nihilistic designed its product to perform equally on both of them, using <a href="Haptic%20technology%23Computer%20and%20video%20games">force feedback</a> and <a href="motion%20detection">motion sensing</a> to enhance the playing experience. "Conan" was originally scheduled for an early 2008 release, but was brought forward to the second half of 2007 because of THQ's poor performance in that <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a>. After the game was released in Europe, Nihilistic made <a href="game%20demo">demos</a> of the game available for downloading over <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>.

The appearance of Howard's Conan and Hyboria in the popular imagination owes much to Frazetta's distinctive oil paintings. While Nihilistic's writers tried to tell a story in Howard's style, its artists attempted to emulate Frazetta's style on the electronic <a href="display%20device">display screen</a>. Instead of making each computer representation as realistic as possible, they created models based mainly on their perception of each object's intrinsic nature. The artists used video graphics technology such as <a href="normal%20mapping">normal mapping</a> technique to emulate brush strokes on the models' <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a>. These digital brush strokes were visible on the cliffs in the game. The character models were outlined with light colors instead of dark ones, creating the subtle blend of object and background found in oil paintings, and <a href="Distance%20fog">fog effects</a> allowed the team to recreate Frazetta's use of shadows in the middle area of the image. To complete the game's appearance, the artists used darker color palettes, motifs, and themes to present a more serious mood, in harmony with the gore and nudity in the game.

Mike Reagan, a music composer noted for his work in video games such as "<a href="Darkwatch">Darkwatch</a>" and "God of War", was hired by THQ to write the music for "Conan". To begin, he wanted to compose simple but powerful melodies, and looked to <a href="Basil%20Poledouris">Basil Poledouris</a>'s score for the 1982 film "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>" for inspiration. As Reagan played development copies of the game, he was influenced by two other works: <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s barbaric and sensual ballet music "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>", and <a href="Bernard%20Hermann">Bernard Hermann</a>'s score from the 1958 action film "<a href="The%207th%20Voyage%20of%20Sinbad">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</a>". Each week, Nihilistic and Reagan updated each other with copies of their work-in-progress, synchronizing their efforts. Reagan also studied with noted percussion artists <a href="Wings%20%28band%29">Denny Seiwell</a>, <a href="Emil%20Richards">Emil Richards</a>, and Michael Duffy to gain further insight on the use of drums to accompany the game's bloody and violent plot. After <a href="Master%20recording">mastering</a> the soundtrack, he brought the music of "Conan" to an October 2007 <a href="Video%20Games%20Live">Video Games Live</a> show, performing it live in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

"Conan" received "average" reviews on both platforms according to the <a href="Review%20aggregator">review aggregation</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Most critics agreed that the game's best selling point was its variety in combat. They had a lot of fun with its easy-to-learn controls, skill customization, and most of all, the varied brutal depictions of Conan's kills. <a href="TeamXbox">TeamXbox</a> said that the combat system "blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user (with gore) for pressing the right buttons at the right time". The pounding, militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics' experience with the game.

In Japan, "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" gave it a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40, while "Famitsu Xbox 360" gave its Xbox 360 version a score of one six, two fives, and one six for a total of 22 out of 40.

Many critics complained that "Conan" copied many ideas from "God of War". "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" referred to this imitation as "[Conan] groveling at <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos'</a> feet, begging for gameplay wisdom". A few reviewers, however, found this forgivable and stated that the game was made to be fun without any higher ambitions. "Conan"s camera system irritated several critics for failing to provide an adequate view of the situation at certain critical moments. Its puzzles were oversimple and lacked clear directions for proceeding to the next step. The <a href="Game%20artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> for the adversaries in the game was found to be predictable and <a href="Software%20bug">flawed</a> by a few critics. In addition, they found the final encounter with Graven to be overlong and frustrating. Calling the fight "as painful as a trip to the <a href="proctologist">proctologist</a>", <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "Game Informer" judged it to be one of the worst boss fights in video game history.

The critics had mixed opinions about three prominent features of the game: voice acting, artwork, and faithfulness to Howard's writings. Perlman earned acclaim for his vocal performance and gravely voice that matched the game's dialogue, but he also received criticism for not sounding like a barbarian. A few applauded Nihilistic for capturing the oil painting feel of Frazetta's art, but several others said that the graphics consisted of drab-looking environments that were jagged-edged and <a href="Pixelation">pixelated</a> when zoomed in. Although the animations were rated to be smooth and vivid, the lack of variety among enemy character models was criticized. Several critics also praised Nihilistic for recreating the atmosphere of Howard's stories. The decision to have Conan use magic was, however, called a "blasphemy" by IGN. <a href="G4%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29">G4 Canada</a> disagreed and forgave the game on the grounds that it was mostly faithful to the books. Ray Huling of "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>" said that the game's developers misunderstood Conan's appeal to the masses. In the journalist's opinion, Howard's depiction of Conan's brutal physical nature called attention to the dull nature of their lives and offered them a temporary escape. Furthermore, Huling said that Nihilistic used the characteristics of Conan for superficial purposes, and that, in copying the mechanics of another game without any groundbreaking innovations of its own, Nihilistic missed the essence of Howard's stories and created a shell of what its game could have been.

Despite the average reviews and success of Howard's franchise, "Conan" sold poorly and failed to recoup THQ's investment. The publisher publicly announced that the game's poor sales contributed to their <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>20 million <a href="write-off">write-off</a> in fiscal year 2008.

Although the game's violence was praised by the gaming industry, it was condemned by the <a href="National%20Institute%20on%20Media%20and%20the%20Family">National Institute on Media and the Family</a>, which placed "Conan" on a list of games that parents were urged to avoid buying for their children. "Conan"s Mature rating from the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>, largely due to its violent content, made the game a target for a law being pushed in <a href="California">California</a>, United States. Proposed in 2005, the law was intended to regulate sales of Mature-rated games. It was blocked by a legal challenge from the gaming industry in 2007, but California Governor <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, who played Conan in the 1982 film, appealed the judgment, seeking to ensure that "Conan" and other games with similar levels of violence would be sold only to those above the age of 17. On February 20, 2009, his appeal was rejected by the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, who ruled that such a restriction violated the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>.

No Such Thing as Vampires

"No Such Thing as Vampires" is the <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot episode</a> of the American <a href="paranormal%20romance">paranormal romance</a> <a href="television%20drama">television drama</a> "<a href="Moonlight%20%28TV%20series%29">Moonlight</a>", which premiered on <a href="CBS">CBS</a> on September 28, 2007, in the United States. It was written by series creators/<a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>s Trevor Munson and Ron Koslow, and directed by executive producer <a href="Rod%20Holcomb">Rod Holcomb</a>. The pilot introduces <a href="Characters%20of%20Moonlight%23Mick%20St.%20John">Mick St. John</a> (<a href="Alex%20O%27Loughlin">Alex O'Loughlin</a>), a private investigator who has been a <a href="vampire">vampire</a> for over fifty years; <a href="Characters%20of%20Moonlight%23Beth%20Turner">Beth Turner</a> (<a href="Sophia%20Myles">Sophia Myles</a>), St. John's love interest; <a href="Characters%20of%20Moonlight%23Josef%20Kostan">Josef Kostan</a> (<a href="Jason%20Dohring">Jason Dohring</a>), St. John's mentor and friend; and <a href="Characters%20of%20Moonlight%23Coraline%20Duvall">Coraline Duvall</a> (<a href="Shannyn%20Sossamon">Shannyn Sossamon</a>), St. John's ex-wife and <a href="Moonlight%20%28TV%20series%29%23Mythology">sire</a>.

The series, originally titled "Twilight", was commissioned by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a> as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes. Alex O'Loughlin, <a href="Shannon%20Lucio">Shannon Lucio</a>, <a href="Rade%20%C5%A0erbed%C5%BEija">Rade Šerbedžija</a> and <a href="Amber%20Valletta">Amber Valletta</a> were cast in the lead roles, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. The project was renamed "Moonlight" when picked up by CBS for the <a href="2007-08%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">2007–2008 American television season</a>. <a href="David%20Greenwalt">David Greenwalt</a> joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside <a href="Joel%20Silver">Joel Silver</a>; however, health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series. All of the original actors save for the male lead role were recast in June 2007, and Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot.

Although received poorly by critics, the pilot managed to finish first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night. Many critics criticized the acting and the writing; one said that it had the "worst writing of the new season". A few found that even though the series did not seem great, it "had potential". Jason Dohring's performance was praised, and one critic wished that he had "a bit more screen time".

Mick St. John, a private investigator, dreams of being interviewed by a woman off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has standards and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him to the scene of the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the <a href="online%20newspaper">online newspaper</a> "BuzzWire", notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the <a href="morgue">morgue</a>, where his friend Guillermo (<a href="Jacob%20Vargas">Jacob Vargas</a>) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.

Professor Ellis (<a href="Rudolf%20Martin">Rudolf Martin</a>), a lecturer of the dead woman, gives a eulogy at her funeral. Chloe, a friend of the dead woman, attacks Ellis and slashes his neck, whose blood Mick recognizes as the blood in the vial. Beth tracks down Chloe, who explains that the professor has a vampire-worshipping blood <a href="cult">cult</a>, and he believes that he is a vampire. Later, Mick finds Chloe's dead body, who was murdered by Ellis. Knowing that Beth has gone to Ellis's class, he rushes to save her. After the class, Beth talks to Ellis about vampires and the young woman's murder, but he discovers that she is wearing a wire. Ellis attacks Beth and although she escapes, she is kidnapped by the professor's teaching assistant. Mick tracks down the assistant, defeats him, and takes an unconscious Beth to his apartment. In <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> to 22 years in the past, Mick investigates the case of a missing girl. In a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline over the kidnapped girl, Mick stabs Coraline's heart with the leg of a broken chair. He lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth wakes up and remembers that Mick was stabbed by the assistant, and that he was the one who saved her as a child. Mick dismisses the claims as being caused by her head injury. Thanking him for saving her, she hugs him.

Trevor Munson conceived the character of Mick Angel in 2004 and spent two and a half years writing a novel featuring the character. The story was adapted into a feature film script, and <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a> was considered as a possibility for the lead role. The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS, who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%281987%20TV%20series%29">Beauty and the Beast</a>", to rewrite the script as a television series.
The series was titled "Twilight", and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot, which <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a> initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes in January 2007. <a href="Joel%20Silver">Joel Silver</a> and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former's production banner, <a href="Silver%20Pictures">Silver Pictures</a>, in the same month. Alex O'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast in the presentation, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director.

The project was renamed "Moonlight" when picked up by CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the <a href="upfronts">upfronts</a>. David Greenwalt, creator of "<a href="Miracles%20%28TV%20series%29">Miracles</a>" and co-creator of "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>", joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Silver. CBS hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, however health reasons forced him to leave the series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007. All of the original actors save for the lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. To promote the series, Silver, along with the rest of the main cast, attended the <a href="Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con International</a> in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> on July 27, 2007, where the show was featured.

Joel Silver approached Dohring "out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's "dark" and "sharp" personality. Dohring had to go through the normal audition process and was not sure if he would have gotten the role without Silver, who had "pushed it all the way through to the end". Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was "to lighten the show up a bit". He believed the changes granted the studio's and network's wish to "make it a little younger and hipper". O'Laughlin felt that the whole cast's becoming "a little bit younger" especially effected the character Josef, as the originally chosen actor, Šerbedžija, was twice Jason Dohring's age. The creators and the network were concerned that Josef, whose relationship with Mick was important, would appear as more of a "father figure" rather than as a friend. O'Laughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting "level of ease in that age difference".

"No Such Thing as Vampires" finished first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night. It was seen by 8.54 million American viewers, and received a 5.7 household rating and a 10% share of all televisions in use. The critical responses to the pilot were overall unfavorable. Several critics compared it detrimentally with the television series "Angel", as well as other vampire related media, including "<a href="Forever%20Knight">Forever Knight</a>", "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", "<a href="Blood%20Ties%20%28TV%20series%29">Blood Ties</a>", "<a href="Night%20Stalker%20%28TV%20series%29">The Night Stalker</a>", "<a href="Dark%20Shadows">Dark Shadows</a>" and the works of <a href="Anne%20Rice">Anne Rice</a>. Tim Goodman of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" considered it as a "flat-out awful" pilot of what "may well be the worst new fall show". Rob Owen of the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" described the pilot as "a weak, generic private-eye drama with a vampire story overlay", and Matthew Gilbert of the "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" felt that it came close to a "full-on nightmare".

The writing of the pilot was criticized as "ponderous", and having "familiar, conventional plots". One critic claimed it did not offer much "to inspire an actor", while another thought it had the "worst writing of the new season". The dialogue was described as "groan-inducing". Tom Shales of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" criticized the series creators' decision to make St. John a private investigator, and felt that they "appear eager to avoid what makes their show unique". Mary McNamara of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" saw promise in the series, but remarked it got "lost between concept and execution, and instead of suspense we get silliness, as if the creators were determined to use only the clichés of both genres". The acting of the pilot was criticized as "sub-par" and "woeful". Robert Bianco of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" felt that "Moonlight" had a "less adept cast" than "Angel". Matthew Gilbert of the "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" depreciated the chemistry between O'Loughlin and Myles as "artificial", and said that they "exchange lines of dialogue with a stilted rhythm and no natural flow". O'Loughlin was described as a "flatliner", and "passable in the lead role", while Sossamon's appearance was said to be "preposterously not-scary". Travis Fickett of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> praised the actors, however, and felt that O'Loughlin did "a decent job", and that Myles was "perhaps the most promising aspect of the show". Maureen Ryan of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" commended Myles as "reasonably good".

Not all reviews, however, were negative. Sarah Stegall of SF Scope gave the pilot a decent review, and said that if "Moonlight" could survive "the Friday night time slot" and the "thwarted expectations of [vampire] fans who were expecting "<a href="Blade%20%28film%20series%29">Blade</a>"", she thought it would "rock". Kara Howland of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" gave the pilot a positive review, and thought it was a "solid start". Several critics praised Jason Dohring's portrayal of Josef. One said that he gave the pilot "a small burst of energy", while another said that he made it "crackle with a bit of wit". Dohring was described as "a welcome presence", and one critic wished for "a bit more screen time". Travis Fickett of IGN praised the action scenes, and noted, "once the action gets started, it plays well".

Kinzua Bridge

The Kinzua Bridge or the Kinzua Viaduct (, ) was a <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20the%20United%20States">railroad</a> <a href="trestle">trestle</a> that spanned <a href="Kinzua%20Creek">Kinzua Creek</a> in <a href="McKean%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">McKean County</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The bridge was tall and long. Most of its structure collapsed during a tornado in 2003.

The bridge was originally built from <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> in 1882 and was billed as the "<a href="Eighth%20Wonder%20of%20the%20World">Eighth Wonder of the World</a>", holding the record as the tallest railroad bridge in the world for two years. In 1900, the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains. It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the <a href="Government%20of%20Pennsylvania">Government of Pennsylvania</a> in 1963, becoming the centerpiece of a state park. Restoration of the bridge began in 2002, but before it was finished, a <a href="tornado">tornado</a> struck the bridge in 2003, causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse. Corroded anchor bolts holding the bridge to its foundations failed, contributing to the collapse.

Before its collapse, the Kinzua Bridge was ranked as the fourth-tallest railway bridge in the United States. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1977 and as a <a href="Historic%20Civil%20Engineering%20Landmark">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> in 1982. The ruins of the Kinzua Bridge are in <a href="Kinzua%20Bridge%20State%20Park">Kinzua Bridge State Park</a> off <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Pennsylvania">U.S. Route 6</a> near the <a href="Borough%20%28Pennsylvania%29">borough</a> of <a href="Mount%20Jewett%2C%20Pennsylvania">Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania</a>.

In 1882, <a href="Thomas%20L.%20Kane">Thomas L. Kane</a>, president of the <a href="New%20York%2C%20Lake%20Erie%20and%20Western%20Railway">New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway</a> (NYLE&W), was faced with the challenge of building a <a href="branch%20line">branch line</a> off the <a href="main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> in Pennsylvania, from <a href="Bradford%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bradford</a> south to the coal fields in <a href="Elk%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Elk County</a>. The fastest way to do so was to build a bridge to cross the <a href="Kinzua%20Creek">Kinzua Valley</a>. The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional of track over rough terrain. When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure at the time: the Portage Bridge over the <a href="Genesee%20River">Genesee River</a> in <a href="western%20New%20York">western New York</a>.

The first Kinzua Bridge was built by a crew of 40 from of <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> in just 94 working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882. The reason for the short construction time was that <a href="scaffolding">scaffolding</a> was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a <a href="Jin-pole">gin pole</a> was used to build the first tower, then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower. The process was then repeated across all 20 towers.

The bridge was designed by the engineer <a href="Octave%20Chanute">Octave Chanute</a> and was built by the <a href="Phoenix%20Iron%20Works%20%28Phoenixville%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Phoenix Iron Works</a>, which specialized in producing patented, hollow iron tubes called "Phoenix columns". Because of the design of these columns, it was often mistakenly believed that the bridge had been built out of wooden poles. The bridge's 110 <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> masonry piers were quarried from the hillside used for the foundation of the bridge. The tallest tower had a base that was wide. The bridge was designed to support a load of , and was estimated to cost between $167,000 and $275,000.

On completion, the bridge was the tallest and longest railroad bridge in the world and was advertised as the "Eighth Wonder of the World". Six of the bridge's 20 towers were taller than the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. Excursion trains from as far away as <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, and <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> would come just to cross the Kinzua Bridge, which held the height record until the <a href="Garabit%20viaduct">Garabit viaduct</a>, tall, was completed in France in 1884. Trains crossing the bridge were restricted to a speed of because the locomotive, and sometimes the wind, caused the bridge to vibrate. People sometimes visited the bridge in hopes of finding the loot of a <a href="bank%20robbery">bank robber</a>, who supposedly hid $40,000 in gold and currency under or near it.

By 1893, the NYLE&W had gone bankrupt and was merged with the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a>, which became the owner of the bridge. By the start of the 20th century, locomotives were almost 85 percent heavier, and the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains. The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24.

The new bridge was designed by C.R. Grimm and was built by the Elmira Bridge Company out of of steel, at a cost of $275,000. Construction began on May 26, starting from both ends of the old bridge. A crew of between 100 and 150 worked 10-hour days for almost four months to complete the new steel frame. Two <a href="Truss%20bridge%23Howe%20truss">Howe Truss</a> "timber travelers", each long and deep, were used to build the towers. Each "traveler" was supported by a pair of the original wrought-iron towers, separated by the one that was to be replaced. After the middle tower was demolished and a new steel one built in its place, the traveler was moved down the line by one tower and the process was repeated. Construction of each new tower and the spans adjoining it took one week to complete. The bolts used to hold the towers to the anchor blocks were reused from the first bridge, which would eventually play a major role in the bridge's demise. Grimm, the designer of the bridge, later admitted that the bolts should have been replaced.

The Kinzua Viaduct reopened to traffic on September 25, 1900. The new bridge was able to safely accommodate one of the largest steam locomotives in the world, the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Big%20Boy">Big Boy</a>. The Erie Railroad maintained a station at the Kinzua Viaduct. Constructed between 1911 and 1916, the station was not manned by an agent. The station was closed sometime between 1923 and 1927.

Train crews would sometimes play a trick on a <a href="brakeman">brakeman</a> on his first journey on the line. When the train was a short distance from the bridge, the crew would send the brakeman over the rooftops of the cars to check on a small supposed problem. As the train crossed the bridge, the rookie "suddenly found himself terrified, staring down three hundred feet [91 m] from the roof of a rocking boxcar". Even after being reconstructed the bridge still had a speed limit of . As the bridge aged, heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so the engines could cross the bridge one at a time. <a href="Diesel%20locomotive">Diesel locomotive</a>s were lighter and did not face this limit; the bridge was last used by a steam locomotive on October 5, 1950.

The Erie Railroad obtained <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> on the nearby <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (B&O) line in the late 1950s, which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge. Regular commercial service ended on June 21, 1959, and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of <a href="Indiana%2C%20Pennsylvania">Indiana, Pennsylvania</a>, for $76,000. The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B&O line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge. According to the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>, the Kinzua Bridge "was a critical structure in facilitating the transport of coal from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region, and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth."

Nick Kovalchick, head of the Kovalchick Salvage Company, which then owned the bridge, was reluctant to dismantle it. On seeing it for the first time he is supposed to have said "There will never be another bridge like this." Kovalchick worked with local groups who wanted to save the structure, and <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania Governor</a> <a href="William%20Scranton">William Scranton</a> signed a bill into law on August 12, 1963, to purchase the bridge and nearby land for $50,000 and create Kinzua Bridge State Park. The deed for the park's was recorded on January 20, 1965, and the park was opened to the public in 1970.

An access road to the park was built in 1974, and new facilities there included a parking lot, drinking water and toilets, and installation of a fence on the bridge deck. There was an official <a href="ribbon%20cutting">ribbon cutting</a> ceremony on July 5, 1975, for the park, which "was and is unique in the park system" since "its centerpiece is a man-made structure". The bridge was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on August 29, 1977, and was named to the <a href="List%20of%20historic%20civil%20engineering%20landmarks">National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks</a> on June 26, 1982.

The <a href="Knox%20and%20Kane%20Railroad">Knox and Kane Railroad</a> (KKRR) operated <a href="tourism">sightseeing</a> trips from <a href="Kane%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kane</a> through the <a href="Allegheny%20National%20Forest">Allegheny National Forest</a> and over the Kinzua Bridge from 1987 until the bridge was closed in 2002. In 1988 it operated the longest steam train excursion in the United States, a round trip to the bridge from the village of <a href="Marienville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Marienville</a> in <a href="Forest%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forest County</a>, with a stop in Kane. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described being on the bridge as "more akin to ballooning than railroading" and noted "You stare straight out with nothing between you and an immense sea of verdure a hundred yards [91 m] below." The railroad still operated excursions through the forest and stopped at the bridge's western approach until October 2004.

As of 2009, Kinzua Bridge State Park is a <a href="List%20of%20Pennsylvania%20state%20parks">Pennsylvania state park</a> surrounding the bridge and the Kinzua Valley. The park is located off of <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Pennsylvania">U.S. Route 6</a> north of Mount Jewett in <a href="Hamlin%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hamlin</a> and <a href="Keating%20Township%2C%20McKean%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Keating</a> Townships. A scenic <a href="overlook">overlook</a> within the park allows views of the fallen bridge and of the valley, and is also a prime location to view the <a href="Autumn%20leaf%20color">fall foliage</a> during in mid-October. The park has a shaded <a href="picnic">picnic</a> area with a centrally located modern <a href="washroom">restroom</a>. Before the bridge's collapse, visitors were allowed on or under the bridge and hiking was allowed in the valley around the bridge. In September 2002 the bridge was closed even to pedestrian traffic. About of Kinzua Bridge State Park are open to hunting. Common game species are <a href="Wild%20turkey">turkey</a>, <a href="American%20black%20bear">bear</a> and <a href="White-tailed%20deer">deer</a>.

Since 2002, the Kinzua Bridge had been closed to all "recreational pedestrian and railroad usage" after it was determined that the structure was at risk to high winds. Engineers had determined that during high winds, the bridge's <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of gravity</a> could shift, putting weight onto only one side of the bridge and causing it to <a href="structural%20failure">fail</a>. An <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>-based bridge construction and repair company had already started work on restoring the Kinzua Bridge in February 2003.

On July 21, 2003, construction workers had already packed up and were starting to leave for the day when a storm arrived. A <a href="tornado">tornado</a> within the storm struck the Kinzua Bridge, snapping and uprooting nearby trees, as well as causing 11 of the 20 bridge towers to collapse. There were no human deaths or injuries. The tornado was produced by a <a href="mesoscale%20convective%20system">mesoscale convective system</a> (MCS), a complex of strong thunderstorms, that had formed over an area that included eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York, and southern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. The MCS traveled east at around . As the MCS crossed northwestern Pennsylvania, it formed into a distinctive <a href="comma">comma</a> shape. The northern portion of the MCS contained a long-lived <a href="mesocyclone">mesocyclone</a>, a thunderstorm with a rotating updraft that is often conducive to tornados.

At approximately 15:20 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a> (19:20 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>), the tornado touched down in Kinzua Bridge State Park, from the Kinzua Bridge. The tornado, classified as F1 on the <a href="Fujita%20scale">Fujita scale</a>, passed by the bridge and continued another before it lifted. It touched down again from <a href="Smethport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Smethport</a> and traveled another before finally dissipating. It was estimated to have been wide and it left a path long. The same storm also spawned an F3 tornado in nearby <a href="Potter%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Potter County</a>.

When the tornado touched down, the winds had increased to at least and were coming from the east, perpendicular to the bridge, which ran north–south. An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first, in a westerly direction. Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge. Next towers four through nine collapsed to the west, twisting clockwise, as the tornado started to move northward. As it moved north, inflow winds came in from the south and caused Towers 12, 13, and 14 to finally collapse towards the north, twisting counterclockwise.

The failures were caused by the badly rusted base bolts holding the bases of the towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into the ground. An investigation determined that the tornado had a wind speed of at least , which applied an estimated of lateral force against the bridge. The investigation also hypothesized that the whole structure oscillated laterally four to five times before <a href="fatigue%20%28material%29">fatigue</a> started to cause the base bolts to fail. The towers fell intact in sections and suffered damage upon impact with the ground. The century-old bridge was destroyed in less than 30 seconds.

The state decided not to rebuild the Kinzua Bridge, which would have cost an estimated $45 million. Instead, it was proposed that the ruins be used as a visitor attraction to show the forces of nature at work. Kinzua Bridge State Park had attracted 215,000 visitors annually before the bridge collapsed, and was chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks". The viaduct and its collapse were featured in the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a>'s "<a href="Life%20After%20People">Life After People</a>" as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to the collapse of any steel structure. The bridge was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on July 21, 2004.

The <a href="Knox%20and%20Kane%20Railroad">Knox and Kane Railroad</a> was forced to suspend operations in October 2004 after a 75 percent decline in the number of passengers, possibly brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The <a href="Kovalchick%20Corporation">Kovalchick Corporation</a> bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the <a href="East%20Broad%20Top%20Railroad">East Broad Top Railroad</a> and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for <a href="scrap%20metal">scrap</a>. The <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> would then be used to establish a <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a>.

Pennsylvania released $700,000 to design repairs on the remaining towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> (DCNR) put forward an $8 million proposal for a new <a href="observation%20deck">observation deck</a> and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a <a href="ribbon-cutting%20ceremony">ribbon-cutting ceremony</a>. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor at the end of the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3 million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5 million in tourism revenue for the region.
