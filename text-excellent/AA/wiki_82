Caloboletus calopus

Caloboletus calopus, <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the bitter beech bolete or scarlet-stemmed bolete, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> of the <a href="Boletaceae">bolete family</a>, found in Asia, Northern Europe and North America. Appearing in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous woodland</a> in summer and autumn, the stout <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are attractively coloured, with a beige to olive <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to 15 cm (6 in) across, yellow pores, and a reddish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> up to long and wide. The pale yellow <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> stains blue when broken or bruised.

<a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Persoon</a> first <a href="species%20description">described</a> "Boletus calopus" in 1801. Modern <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> showed that it was only distantly related to the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>" and required placement in a new <a href="genus">genus</a>; "<a href="Caloboletus">Caloboletus</a>" was erected in 2014, with "C. calopus" designated as the type species. Although "Caloboletus calopus" is not typically considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>".

"Caloboletus calopus" was originally published under the name "Boletus olivaceus" by <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> in 1774, but this name is unavailable for use as it was later <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> for another species. <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a>'s 1792 <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> "Boletus lapidum" is also illegitimate. <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> <a href="Species%20description">described</a> the mushroom in 1801; its <a href="botanical%20name">specific name</a> is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "καλος/kalos" ("pretty") and "πους/pous" ("foot"), referring to its brightly coloured <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. The German name, "Schönfußröhrling" or "pretty-foot bolete", is a literal translation. Alternate <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s are scarlet-stemmed bolete and bitter beech bolete.

Other synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers to "Dictyopus" by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1886, and "Tubiporus" by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Maire">René Maire</a> in 1937. "Boletus frustosus", originally published as a distinct species by <a href="Wally%20Snell">Wally Snell</a> and Esther Dick in 1941, was later described as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "B. calopus" by <a href="Orson%20K.%20Miller">Orson K. Miller</a> and <a href="Roy%20Watling">Roy Watling</a> in 1968. Estadès and Lannoy described the variety "ruforubraporus" and the <a href="form%20%28botany%29">form</a> "ereticulatus" from Europe in 2001.

In his 1986 infrageneric <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of the genus "Boletus", <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> placed "C. calopus" as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Calopodes", which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, bitter taste, and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section "Calopodes" include "<a href="Caloboletus%20radicans">C. radicans</a>", "<a href="Caloboletus%20inedulis">C. inedulis</a>", "<a href="Boletus%20peckii">B. peckii</a>", and "<a href="Boletus%20pallidus">B. pallidus</a>". <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Genetic analysis</a> published in 2013 showed that "C. calopus" and many (but not all) red-pored boletes were part of a "dupainii" <a href="clade">clade</a> (named for <a href="Rubroboletus%20dupainii">"Boletus" (now "Rubroboletus") "dupainii"</a>), well-removed from the core group of the type species "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">B. edulis</a>" and relatives within the <a href="Boletineae">Boletineae</a>. This indicated it needed placement in a new genus. This took place in 2014, "B. calopus" was transferred to (and designated the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of) the new genus "<a href="Caloboletus">Caloboletus</a>" by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini.

Up to 15 cm (6 in) or rarely 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is beige to olive and initially almost globular before opening out to a hemispherical and then convex shape. The surface of the cap is smooth or has minute hairs, and sometimes develops cracks with age. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> hangs over the cap margin. The pore surface is initially pale yellow before deepening to an olive-yellow in maturity, and quickly turns blue when it is injured. The pores, numbering one or two per millimetre, are circular when young but become more angular as the mushroom ages. The tubes are up to deep.

The attractively coloured stipe is typically yellow above to pink-red below, with a straw-coloured network (reticulation) near the top or over the upper half; occasionally the entire stipe is reddish. It measures long by thick, and is either fairly equal in width throughout, or thicker towards the base. Sometimes, the reddish stipe colour of mature mushrooms or harvested specimens that are a few days old disappears completely, and is replaced with ochre-brown tones. The pale yellow <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> stains blue when broken, the discolouration spreading out from the damaged area. Its smell can be strong, and has been likened to ink. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is olive to olive-brown. <a href="Spore">Spore</a>s are smooth and elliptical, measuring 13–19 by 5–6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–38 by 9–12 µm. The <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are club-shaped to spindle-shaped, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>, and measure 25–40 by 10–15 µm.

Variety "frustosus" is <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> similar to the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are slightly smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5 µm. In the European form "ereticulatus", the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety "ruforubraporus" has pinkish-red pores.

The overall colouration of "Caloboletus calopus", with its pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared with any other bolete. Large pale specimens resemble "<a href="Suillellus%20luridus">Suillellus luridus</a>", and the cap of "<a href="Rubroboletus%20satanas">Rubroboletus satanas</a>" is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with "<a href="Xerocomellus%20chrysenteron">Xerocomellus chrysenteron</a>" but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">B. edulis</a>" lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible "C. radicans", which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like "C. calopus", the western North American species "<a href="Caloboletus%20rubripes">C. rubripes</a>" also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, "<a href="Boletus%20coniferarum">B. coniferarum</a>" lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.

Two eastern North American species, "C. inedulis" and "<a href="Caloboletus%20roseipes">C. roseipes</a>", also have an appearance similar to "C. calopus". "C. inedulis" produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while "C. roseipes" associates solely with <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a>. "<a href="Caloboletus%20firmus">C. firmus</a>", found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike "C. calopus", has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation. "<a href="Caloboletus%20panniformis">C. panniformis</a>", a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to "C. calopus", but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>-<a href="staining">staining</a> cells in the flesh of the cap, and morphologically distinct <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the stipe.

An <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l species, "Caloboletus calopus" grows in <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland, often at higher altitudes, especially under <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a>. Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups. The species grows on chalky ground from July to December, in Northern Europe, and North America's <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. In North America, its range extends south to Mexico. Variety "frustosus" is known from <a href="California">California</a> and the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. In 1968, after comparing European and North American collections, Miller and Watling suggested that the typical form of "C. calopus" does not occur in the United States. Similar comparisons by other authors have led them to the opposite conclusion, and the species has since been included in several North American <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a>s. The bolete has been recorded from the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> region in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, from under "<a href="Populus%20ciliata">Populus ciliata</a>" and "<a href="Abies%20pindrow">Abies pindrow</a>" in <a href="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a> and <a href="Nathia%20Gali">Nathia Gali</a> in Pakistan, <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> Province in China, Korea, and Taiwan.

Although it is an attractive-looking bolete, "Caloboletus calopus" is not considered edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste is largely due to the compounds calopin and a δ-<a href="lactone">lactone</a> derivative, "O"-acetylcyclocalopin A. These compounds contains a <a href="structural%20motif">structural motif</a> known as a <a href="3-Methylcatechol">3-methylcatechol</a> unit, which is rare in <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a>s. A <a href="total%20synthesis">total synthesis</a> of calopin was reported in 2003.

The <a href="pulvinic%20acid">pulvinic acid</a> derivatives <a href="atromentic%20acid">atromentic acid</a>, <a href="variegatic%20acid">variegatic acid</a>, and <a href="xerocomic%20acid">xerocomic acid</a> are present in "B. calopus" mushrooms. These compounds <a href="enzyme%20inhibition">inhibit</a> <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a>—major <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s involved in <a href="drug%20metabolism">drug metabolism</a> and <a href="bioactivation">bioactivation</a>. Other compounds found in the fruit bodies include calopin B, and the <a href="sesquiterpenoid">sesquiterpenoid</a> compounds cyclopinol and boletunones A and B. The latter two highly oxygenated compounds have significant <a href="antioxidant">free-radical scavenging</a> activity "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>". The compounds <a href="3-Octanone">3-octanone</a> (47.0% of total <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> compounds), <a href="3-Octanol">3-octanol</a> (27.0%), <a href="1-Octen-3-ol">1-octen-3-ol</a> (15.0%), and <a href="limonene">limonene</a> (3.6%) are the predominant volatile components that give the fruit body its odour.

Ulm Campaign

The Ulm Campaign was a series of <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French</a> and <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian</a> military maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> army in 1805 during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>. It took place in the vicinity of and inside the <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n (then <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n) city of <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>. The French <a href="La%20Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">Grande Armée</a>, led by <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, comprised 210,000 troops organized into seven <a href="corps">corps</a>, and hoped to knock out the Austrian army in the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> before <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> reinforcements could arrive. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under <a href="Karl%20Freiherr%20Mack%20von%20Leiberich">General Mack</a> on 20 October at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners</a> in the campaign to 60,000. The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the <a href="Schlieffen%20Plan">Schlieffen Plan</a> in the late 19th century.

The victory at Ulm did not end the war, since a large Russian army under <a href="Mikhail%20Illarionovich%20Kutuzov">Kutuzov</a> was still near <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. The Russians withdrew to the northeast to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on 12 November. On 2 December the decisive French victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Austerlitz</a> removed Austria from the war. The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29">Treaty of Pressburg</a> in late December brought the Third Coalition to an end and left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a> with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> and Russia the following year.

Europe had been by then embroiled in the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> since 1792. After five years of war, the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a> subdued the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a> in 1797. A <a href="Second%20Coalition">Second Coalition</a> was formed in 1798 but this too was defeated by 1801. <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> remained the only opponent for the new <a href="French%20Consulate">French Consulate</a>. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amiens">Treaty of Amiens</a>. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the <a href="Haitian%20Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.

In December 1804, an Anglo-<a href="Enlightened%20Absolute%20Monarchy%20in%20Sweden">Swedish</a> agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a> spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.

Prior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the <a href="Napoleon%27s%20invasion%20of%20England">"Army of England,"</a> an invasion force meant to strike at the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, around six camps at <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Although boredom quickly set in among the troops, Napoleon paid many visits to conduct lavish parades to maintain their morale.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call "<a href="La%20Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">La Grande Armée</a>" ("The Great Army"). At the start, the French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven <a href="corps">corps</a>, which were large field units, each containing about 36 to 40 <a href="cannon">cannon</a> each and capable of independent action until other corps could arrive. On top, Napoleon created a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> reserve of 22,000 troopers organized into two <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, four mounted <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a> divisions and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry, all supported by 24 <a href="artillery">artillery</a> pieces. By 1805, La Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000, was equipped and trained. It possessed a competent officer class where almost all from sergeants to marshals had experience in the recent Revolutionary Wars.

<a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a>, brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the "<a href="Hofkriegsrat">Hofkriegsrat</a>" (<a href="Aulic%20Council">Aulic Council</a>), the military-political council responsible for decision making in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France.

<a href="Karl%20Mack">Karl Mack</a> became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry on the eve of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s of four <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training; new units were led by commanders who had not been given sufficient tactical training in using their units.

Austrian cavalry forces were regarded as the best in Europe, but the detachment of many cavalry units to various infantry formations precluded the hitting power of their massed French counterparts, who could, at the orders of Napoleon, amass a whole corps of cavalry to influence the battle.

The Ulm Campaign lasted for nearly a month and saw the French army under Napoleon deliver blow after blow to the confused Austrians. It culminated on 20 October with the loss of an entire Austrian army.

General Mack thought that Austrian security relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed that there would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.

Fatally, the Aulic Council decided to make Northern Italy the main theater of operations for the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>s. <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a> was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the <a href="Adige%20River">Adige River</a> with <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>, <a href="Peschiera%20Borromeo">Peschiera</a>, and <a href="Milan">Milan</a> as the initial objectives. The Austrians based an army of 72,000 men on Ulm. Nominally commanded by <a href="Archduke%20Ferdinand%20Karl%20Joseph%20of%20Austria-Este">Archduke Ferdinand</a>, the army's real authority was Mack. Austrian strategy required that <a href="Archduke%20Johann%20of%20Austria">Archduke John</a> with 23,000 troops secure the <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> and provide the link between his brother Charles's army and his cousin Ferdinand's army. The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in <a href="Swedish%20Pomerania">Pomerania</a> and the British in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, though these were designed to confuse the French and divert their resources.

In both the campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater as the central focus of French efforts, but in both instances the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Marshal Murat</a> would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">Masséna</a> would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the <a href="Arm%C3%A9e%20d%27Italie">Armée d'Italie</a>, <a href="Laurent%2C%20marquis%20de%20Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">St. Cyr</a> would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal <a href="Guillaume%20Marie%20Anne%20Brune">Brune</a> would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.

Murat and <a href="Henri%20Gratien%2C%20Comte%20Bertrand">Bertrand</a> conducted reconnaissance between the area bordering the Tyrol and the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> as <a href="Anne%20Jean%20Marie%20Ren%C3%A9%20Savary">Savary</a>, chief of the planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube. The left wing of the Grande Armée would move from <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> in northern Germany and <a href="Utrecht%20%28city%29">Utrecht</a> in the Netherland to fall on <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>; the right and center, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the <a href="Middle%20Rhine">Middle Rhine</a> around cities like <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> and <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, a move that was supposed to isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.

On 22 September Mack decided to hold the <a href="Iller">Iller</a> line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that <a href="Charles%20XIV%20John%20of%20Sweden">Bernadotte</a>'s I Corps had marched through Prussian <a href="Ansbach">Ansbach</a>, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that <a href="Michael%20von%20Kienmayer">Kienmayer</a>'s Corps was sent to <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a> east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered <a href="Michel%20Ney">Ney</a> to join <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Lannes</a>, <a href="Nicolas%20Jean%20de%20Dieu%20Soult">Soult</a>, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at <a href="Battle%20of%20Donauw%C3%B6rth">Donauwörth</a>. The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place – they instead deployed on a long west-east axis – and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack's escape route.

Realizing the danger of his position, Mack decided to go on the offensive. On 8 October he commanded the army to concentrate around Günzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at Günzburg would yield a large strategic advantage. To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to Günzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at <a href="Wertingen">Wertingen</a> between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes.

 
For reasons not entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg to take his division of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from <a href="G%C3%BCnzburg">Günzburg</a> to Wertingen in preparation for the main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions – <a href="Louis%20Klein">Louis Klein</a>'s 1st <a href="Dragoon">Dragoon</a> Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and <a href="Etienne%20de%20Nansouty">Nansouty's</a> 1st <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a> Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by <a href="Nicolas%20Oudinot">Nicolas Oudinot</a>'s grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Wertingen">Battle of Wertingen</a> had been an easy French victory.
The action at Wertingen convinced Mack to operate on the left (north) bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross to the north at Günzburg. On 8 October Ney was operating under <a href="Louis%20Alexandre%20Berthier">Louis Alexandre Berthier</a>'s directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Firmin%20Malher">Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher</a>'s 3rd Division to capture the Günzburg bridges over the Danube. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20G%C3%BCnzburg">Battle of Günzburg</a>, a column of this division ran into some Tyrolean jaegers and captured 200 of them, including their commander <a href="Konstantin%20Ghilian%20Karl%20d%27Aspr%C3%A9">Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré</a>, along with two cannons. The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around Günzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons. Malher's division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in <a href="Ignaz%20Gyulai">Ignaz Gyulai</a> with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment. Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right (south) bank of the Danube. While the Battle of Günzburg was being fought, Ney sent <a href="Louis%20Henri%20Loison">Louis Henri Loison</a>'s 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at <a href="Elchingen">Elchingen</a>, which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October Ney's corps had made significant progress: Malher's 3rd division had crossed to the right (south) bank, Loison's 2nd division held Elchingen, and <a href="Pierre%20Dupont%20de%20l%27%C3%89tang">Pierre Dupont de l'Étang</a>'s 1st Division was heading towards Ulm.

The demoralized Austrian army arrived at Ulm in the early hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating his course of action and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought. During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney's and Lannes's corps. The French were separated in two massive wings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes, and Murat to the west were containing Mack while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte, and <a href="Auguste%20Marmont">Auguste Marmont</a> to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, supported by one dragoon division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did not know that the entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm.

The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's division marched from <a href="Haslach%20an%20der%20M%C3%BChl">Haslach</a> towards Ulm and ran into four Austrian regiments holding Boefingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every one. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to <a href="Ulm-Jungingen">Ulm-Jungingen</a> hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed what was happening and preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen, during which he took as prisoner at least 1,000 of the Austrians. Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced to fall back on Albeck, where he joined <a href="Louis%20Baraguey%20d%27Hilliers">Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers</a>'s foot dragoons division. The effects of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Haslach-Jungingen">Battle of Haslach-Jungingen</a> on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained that the majority of the Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm. Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich. Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself. These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck.

At this point in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, charging that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under <a href="Johann%20Sigismund%20Riesch">Johann Sigismund Riesch</a> headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under <a href="Franz%20von%20Werneck">Franz von Werneck</a> went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Elchingen">Battle of Elchingen</a>, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title "Duke of Elchingen" for his impressive victory.

On 13 October Soult's IV Corps fell on <a href="Memmingen">Memmingen</a> from the east. After a minor clash that resulted in 16 French casualties, General-Major Karl Spangen von Uyternesse surrendered 4,600 soldiers, eight guns, and nine colors. The Austrians were low on ammunition, cut off from Ulm, and completely demoralized by the confusion reigning at army headquarters.
More actions took place on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of <a href="Heidenheim%2C%20Bavaria">Heidenheim</a>. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed in the vicinity of the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm. Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the <a href="Imperial%20Guard">Imperial Guard</a> were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at <a href="Treuchtlingen">Treuchtlingen</a> on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards <a href="Neustadt%20an%20der%20Donau">Neustadt an der Donau</a> and captured 12,000 Austrians.

Events at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, <a href="Philippe%20Paul%2C%20comte%20de%20S%C3%A9gur">Ségur</a>, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and <a href="Neresheim">Neresheim</a> and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, <a href="Johann%20von%20Klenau">Johann von Klenau</a>, <a href="Maximilian%20Anton%20Karl%2C%20Count%20Baillet%20de%20Latour">Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour</a>, <a href="Johann%20I%20Joseph%2C%20Prince%20of%20Liechtenstein">Prince Liechtenstein</a>, and <a href="Ignaz%20Gyulai">Ignaz Gyulai</a>.

As the Austrians were marching out of Ulm to surrender, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet was being destroyed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>. This decisive <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> victory ended the naval threat from France and ensured British naval domination until <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Despite this setback, the Ulm Campaign had been a spectacular victory and had witnessed the elimination of an entire Austrian army at very little cost for the French. The 8th bulletin of the Grande Armée described the scale of the achievement:

<a href="Pierre%20Augereau">Marshal Augereau</a>'s arrival from <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> with the newly formed <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">VII Corps</a> gave the French one more piece of good news. In the <a href="Capitulation%20of%20Dornbirn">Capitulation of Dornbirn</a> on 13 November, <a href="Franjo%20Jela%C4%8Di%C4%87">Franjo Jelačić</a>'s division was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of "la manoeuvre sur les derrières", a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. As the enemy became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.

The Ulm Campaign is considered to be one of the greatest historical examples of a strategic <a href="turning%20movement">turning movement</a>. Historians often analyze the campaign on a wide strategic level that does not include tactical confrontations, even though these were common and relevant. The decisive victory at Ulm is also believed to be a product of the long training and preparation the Grande Armée received at the camps of Boulogne. The Grande Armée carried little baggage, invaded enemy territory at harvest time, and marched far faster than the Austrians had expected. The campaign highlighted the utility of the "Corps d'Armée" system; corps went on to become the fundamental strategic building block for the major wars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A typical corps might have three infantry divisions, a light cavalry brigade for reconnaissance, and reserve artillery batteries in addition to those attached to each division; their increased size allowed them to fight without support for long periods of time, as Ney did, and their durability permitted them to spread out and subsist by requisitioning local food. The French needed about one eighth the transport used by contemporary armies, giving them a level of mobility and flexibility unseen at that time: invasions of South Germany by <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Marlborough</a> or <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Marie%20Moreau">Moreau</a> covered a narrow front, but the Grande Armée invaded in 1805 on a front that was wide, an action that took the Austrians by complete surprise and caused them to underestimate the gravity of the situation.

Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907

Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 was a <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">Boeing 737-8EH</a> on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, Brazil, to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. On the afternoon of 29 September 2006, it collided in mid-air with an <a href="Embraer%20Legacy%20600">Embraer Legacy 600</a> business jet over the Brazilian state of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>. The Boeing 737 broke up in mid-air and crashed into an area of dense jungle, killing all 154 passengers and crew on board; despite sustaining serious damage to its left wing and tail, the Embraer Legacy jet landed safely with its seven occupants uninjured. 

The accident was investigated by the Brazilian <a href="Aeronautical%20Accidents%20Investigation%20and%20Prevention%20Center">Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center</a> ( (CENIPA)) and the U.S. <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB), and a final report was issued in 2008. CENIPA concluded that the accident was caused by <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> (ATC) errors combined with mistakes made by the American pilots on the Legacy, while the NTSB determined that both flight crews acted properly and were placed on a collision course by ATC, deeming the Legacy pilots' disabling of their <a href="Traffic%20collision%20avoidance%20system">TCAS</a> system to be only a contributing factor rather than a direct cause.

The accident, which triggered a <a href="2006%E2%80%932007%20Brazilian%20aviation%20crisis">crisis in Brazilian civil aviation</a>, was the deadliest in Brazil's aviation history at the time. It remains the second worst plane crash in Brazil, after <a href="TAM%20Airlines%20Flight%203054">TAM Airlines Flight 3054</a> in 2007.

The <a href="Gol%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos">Gol Transportes Aéreos</a> twin <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> Boeing 737-8EH aircraft, registration PR-GTD, was a new Short Field Performance variant, with 186 seats (36 Economy Plus and 150 Economy seats). It made its first flight on 22 August 2006 and was delivered to Gol on 12 September 2006, less than three weeks before the accident.
There were six crew members and 148 passengers on board the Boeing airliner. The six crew members and 105 of the passengers were Brazilian; the remaining passengers were of various other nationalities. The crew consisted of Captain Decio Chaves Jr., 44, First Officer Thiago Jordão Cruso, 29, and four flight attendants. The captain, who had also been serving as a Boeing 737 flight instructor for Gol, had 15,498 total flight hours, with 13,521 in Boeing 737 aircraft. The first officer had 3,981 total flight hours, with 3,081 in Boeing 737 aircraft.

Gol Flight 1907 (<a href="ICAO">ICAO</a> code "GLO 1907") departed <a href="Eduardo%20Gomes%20International%20Airport">Eduardo Gomes International Airport</a> in <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a> on 29 September 2006, at 15:35 (BRT) (18:35 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>), en route to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%E2%80%93Gale%C3%A3o%20International%20Airport">Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport</a>, with a planned intermediate stop at <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia%20International%20Airport">Brasília International Airport</a>.

The twin turbofan Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, serial number 965 and registration N600XL, newly built by Embraer and purchased by <a href="ExcelAire">ExcelAire</a> Service Inc. of <a href="Ronkonkoma%2C%20New%20York">Ronkonkoma, New York</a>, was on a delivery flight by ExcelAire from the Embraer factory to the United States. It departed from <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jos%C3%A9%20dos%20Campos%20Airport">São José dos Campos-Professor Urbano Ernesto Stumpf Airport</a> (SJK), near <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, at 14:51 BRT (17:51 UTC), and was on its way to Eduardo Gomes International Airport (MAO) in Manaus as a planned en route stop.

The ExcelAire flight crew consisted of Captain Joseph Lepore, 42, and First Officer Jan Paul Paladino, 34, both U.S. citizens. Lepore had been a commercial pilot for more than 20 years and had logged 9,388 total flight hours, with 5.5 hours in the Legacy 600. Paladino had been a commercial pilot for a decade and had accumulated more than 6,400 flight hours, including 317 hours flying as captain of Embraer <a href="Embraer%20ERJ%20145%20family">ERJ-145 and ERJ-135</a> jet aircraft for <a href="Envoy%20Air">American Eagle Airlines</a>. (The <a href="Embraer%20ERJ%20145%20family">ERJ-145 and ERJ-135</a> aircraft are <a href="regional%20jet">regional jet</a>s of the same family as the Legacy.) Paladino had also served as first officer for <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, flying <a href="MD-82">MD-82</a>, <a href="MD-83">MD-83</a> and Boeing 737-800 aircraft between the U.S. and Canada. Both pilots were legally qualified to fly the Embraer Legacy as captain.

Two of the five passengers were Embraer employees, two were ExcelAire executives, and the fifth passenger was "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" business travel columnist <a href="Joe%20Sharkey">Joe Sharkey</a>, who was writing a special report for "<a href="Business%20Jet%20Traveler">Business Jet Traveler</a>".

At 16:56:54 (19:56:54 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>), the Boeing 737 and the Embraer Legacy jet <a href="mid-air%20collision">collided</a> almost head-on at , approximately midway between <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a> and <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, near the town of Matupá, southeast of Manaus. The left <a href="Wingtip%20device">winglet</a> of the Embraer sheared off about half of the 737's left wing, causing the 737 to nosedive and enter an uncontrollable spin, which quickly led to an in-flight breakup. When the 737 was hit, the left engine remained on the remaining wing attached to the aircraft. The Boeing 737 crashed into an area of dense rainforest, east of the municipality of <a href="Peixoto%20de%20Azevedo">Peixoto de Azevedo</a>. All 154 passengers and crew on board died and the aircraft was destroyed, with the wreckage scattered in pieces around the crash site.
The Embraer jet, despite serious damage to the left <a href="horizontal%20stabilizer">horizontal stabilizer</a> and left winglet, was able to continue flying, though its autopilot disengaged and it required an unusual amount of force on the yoke to keep the wings level.

With radio relay assistance from <a href="Polar%20Air%20Cargo">Polar Air Cargo</a> Flight 71, a <a href="Boeing%20747-400">Boeing 747</a> cargo aircraft flying in the area at the time, the Embraer's crew successfully landed the crippled jet at <a href="Cachimbo%20Airport">Cachimbo Airport</a>, part of the large military complex <a href="Campo%20de%20Provas%20Brigadeiro%20Velloso">Campo de Provas Brigadeiro Velloso</a>, at about from the collision point.

Passenger and journalist <a href="Joe%20Sharkey">Joe Sharkey</a> described his experience on board the Embraer in an article for "The New York Times", titled "Colliding With Death at 37,000 Feet, and Living", filed on 1 October 2006:

Immediately after the Embraer's emergency landing at the Cachimbo air base, <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a> and <a href="National%20Civil%20Aviation%20Agency%20of%20Brazil">Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil</a> (ANAC) officials detained and interviewed the flight crew. The two "<a href="Flight%20recorder">black boxes</a>"—the <a href="Flight%20recorder%23Cockpit%20voice%20recorder">Cockpit Voice Recorder</a> (CVR) and the <a href="Flight%20recorder%23Flight%20data%20recorder">Flight Data Recorder</a> (FDR)—were removed from the Embraer, and sent to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jos%C3%A9%20dos%20Campos">São José dos Campos</a>, São Paulo, and from there to <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, Canada, at the <a href="Transportation%20Safety%20Board">Transportation Safety Board</a> (TSB) laboratories, for analysis.

In an initial deposition, the Embraer flight crew testified that they were cleared to <a href="flight%20level">flight level</a> 370, approximately <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above mean sea level</a>, by Brasília <a href="Air%20traffic%20control">ATC</a>, and were level at that assigned altitude when the collision occurred. They also asserted that they had lost contact with Brasília ATC at the time of the collision, and their <a href="Traffic%20collision%20avoidance%20system">anti-collision system</a> did not alert them to any oncoming traffic.

On 2 October 2006, the Embraer's captain and first officer were ordered by the <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> Justice Tribunal to surrender their passports pending further investigation. The request, made by the <a href="Peixoto%20de%20Azevedo">Peixoto de Azevedo</a> prosecutor, was granted by judge Tiago Sousa Nogueira e Abreu, who stated that the possibility of pilot error on the part of the Embraer crew could not be ruled out. The Embraer crew were forced to remain in Brazil until their passports were released to them on 5 December 2006, more than two months after the accident, after federal judge Candido Ribeiro ruled there were no legal grounds for "restricting the freedom of motion of the foreigners."

Prior to their scheduled departure to the United States, the crew were formally charged by <a href="Federal%20Police%20Department">Brazilian Federal Police</a> with "endangering an aircraft", which carries a penalty of up to twelve years in prison. The two pilots had to explain why they had not switched on the transponder. They were allowed to leave the country after signing a document promising to return to Brazil for their trial or when required by Brazilian authorities. They picked up their passports and flew back to the U.S.

The <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a> (the Força Aérea Brasileira or "FAB") sent five fixed-wing aircraft and three helicopters to the region for an extensive <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported to be involved in the operation, among them a group of <a href="Kayapo%20people">Kayapo people</a> familiar with the forest. The crash site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30 September by the air force, at coordinates , east of <a href="Peixoto%20de%20Azevedo">Peixoto de Azevedo</a>, near Fazenda Jarinã, a cattle ranch. It was reported that rescue personnel were having difficulty reaching the crash site due to the dense forest. The Brazilian airport operating company, <a href="Infraero">Infraero</a>, at first indicated the possibility of five survivors, but a later statement from the Brazilian Air Force, based on data collected by their personnel who <a href="abseiling">rappelled</a> to the crash site, and local police who assisted in the SAR effort, confirmed that there were no survivors. Brazilian President <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> declared three days of national mourning.
The <a href="Flight%20recorder%23Flight%20data%20recorder">FDR</a> and a non-data part of the <a href="Flight%20recorder%23Cockpit%20voice%20recorder">CVR</a> from the Boeing 737 were found on 2 October 2006 and handed over to the investigators, who sent them to the TSB for analysis. On 25 October 2006, after nearly four weeks of intensive searching in the jungle by about 200 Brazilian Army troops equipped with metal detectors, the memory module of the Boeing's cockpit voice recorder was found. The module was discovered intact, separated from other wreckage pieces, embedded in about of soil, and was also sent for analysis by the TSB in Canada.

On 4 October, the recovery crews began moving the bodies to the temporary base established at the nearby Jarinã ranch. The <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">FAB</a> deployed a <a href="De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-5%20Buffalo">C-115 Buffalo</a> aircraft to transport the bodies to Brasília for identification.

The recovery teams worked intensively for nearly seven weeks in a dense jungle environment, searching for and identifying the victims' remains. All of the victims had been recovered and identified by <a href="Genetic%20fingerprinting">DNA testing</a> by 22 November 2006.

The accident was investigated by the <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a>'s <a href="Aeronautical%20Accidents%20Investigation%20and%20Prevention%20Center">Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center</a> (CENIPA) and the U.S. <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB). In accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 13, the NTSB participated in the investigation as representative for the state (country) of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> avionics equipment installed in both planes.

Once the black boxes and communication transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the Legacy jet's flight crew and the air traffic controllers, trying to piece together the scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on <a href="Instrument%20flight%20rules">instrument flights</a> in <a href="Controlled%20airspace">positive control airspace</a>.

The Embraer's flight plan consisted of flying at FL370 up to Brasília, on <a href="Airway%20%28aviation%29">airway</a> UW2, followed by a planned descent at Brasília to FL360, proceeding outbound from Brasília northwest-bound along airway UZ6 to the Teres fix, an aeronautical <a href="waypoint">waypoint</a> located 282 <a href="Nautical%20mile">nmi</a> (324 mi, 522 km) northwest of Brasília, where a climb to FL380 was planned. According to the filed flight plan, the Embraer was scheduled to have been level at FL380, proceeding towards Manaus, while passing the eventual collision point, which was about northwest of Teres.

The Embraer's crew asserted in their depositions and subsequent interviews that they were cleared by <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> (ATC) to FL370 for the entire trip, all the way to Manaus. The actual transcript of the clearance given to the Embraer's crew prior to takeoff at São José dos Campos at 14:41:57, as later released by CENIPA, was:
November Six Zero Zero X-ray Lima, ATC clearance to Eduardo Gomes, flight level three seven zero direct Poços de Caldas, <a href="Transponder%20%28aviation%29">squawk transponder</a> code four five seven four, after take-off perform Oren departure.

The Embraer's crew's altitude clearance to FL370 was further confirmed after their handoff to Brasília, during which they had the following radio exchange with ATC at 15:51.

This was the last two-way radio communication between the Embraer's crew and ATC prior to the collision.

The Embraer took off from São José dos Campos at 14:51, reaching FL370 at 15:33, 42 minutes later, where it remained until the collision.

ATC maintained normal two-way radio contact with the Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on <a href="VHF">VHF</a> frequency 125.05 <a href="MHz">MHz</a> with Brasília <a href="Area%20Control%20Center">Center</a>. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasília <a href="VHF%20omnidirectional%20range">VOR</a>. The Embraer overflew the Brasília VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasília VOR, <a href="secondary%20radar">secondary radar</a> contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (<a href="Aviation%20transponder%20interrogation%20modes%23Mode%20A%20and%20Mode%20C">Mode C</a>) on the controller's radar screen.

No attempt was made by either the Embraer or Brasília Center to contact each other from 15:51 until 16:26 when, 24 minutes after the loss of secondary radar contact, Brasília Center called the Embraer and received no reply.

Brasília Center then unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Embraer six more times, between 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30, the Embraer's primary radar target became intermittent, and disappeared completely from the radar screen by 16:38, eight minutes later. Brasília Center unsuccessfully attempted to effect a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the blind.
The Embraer, on the other hand, started calling Brasília Center, also unsuccessfully, from 16:48 and continued with twelve more unsuccessful attempts until 16:53. Some limited contact was made at that point, but the Embraer was unable to copy the Amazonic Center frequencies. The Embraer then continued its attempts to reach Brasília Center, seven more times until the collision.

The collision occurred at 16:56:54 (19:56:54 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>) at FL370, and it was confirmed that neither <a href="Traffic%20Collision%20Avoidance%20System">Traffic Collision Avoidance System</a> (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's <a href="transponder%20%28aviation%29">transponder</a> had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.

At 16:59:50, about three minutes after the collision, Amazonic Center started to receive the Embraer's secondary radar reply, with its correct altitude and last assigned code. At 17:00:30 Amazonic Center unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Embraer by radio.
The Embraer started calling on the emergency frequency, 121.5 MHz, immediately after the collision, but as it was later determined in the CENIPA report, the emergency <a href="transceiver">transceiver</a>s in the area were not operational and thus the crew was unable to reach ATC on that frequency.

At 17:01:06 the Embraer established contact on the emergency frequency with a <a href="Boeing%20747-400">Boeing 747</a> cargo aircraft, <a href="Polar%20Air%20Cargo">Polar</a> 71, which attempted to relay to ATC their request for an emergency landing, and continued to provide relay and translation assistance to the Embraer until its eventual landing.

At 17:18:03 the Embraer contacted the Cachimbo Airport control tower directly to coordinate its emergency landing there, and landed safely at Cachimbo at 17:23:00.

Gol 1907 took off from Manaus at 15:35, flying southeast-bound along UZ6 and reaching FL370 at 15:58, 23 minutes later, where it remained until the collision. There were no radio or radar contact problems with the flight until its handoff to Brasília Center. There were no known attempts by ATC to warn Flight 1907 of the conflicting traffic.

On 2 May 2007, the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">NTSB</a> issued a Safety Recommendation document that included an interim summary of the investigation to date, as well as some immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Authority">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a <a href="Traffic%20Collision%20Avoidance%20System">Traffic Collision Avoidance System</a> (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the <a href="Cockpit%20Voice%20Recorder">Cockpit Voice Recorder</a> (CVR):

Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning at the time of the accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.
The NTSB added that the design of the Embraer's avionics is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.

Based on its observations, the NTSB recommended to the FAA that design changes be implemented to improve the noticeability of TCAS annunciation, and that the FAA advise pilots of all aircraft types to familiarize themselves with the details of this accident, with the ways in which a pilot could inadvertently cause the loss of transponder and/or TCAS function, and how to recognize a loss of function.

On 10 December 2008, more than two years after the accident, <a href="Aeronautical%20Accidents%20Investigation%20and%20Prevention%20Center">CENIPA</a> issued its final report, describing its investigation, findings, conclusions and recommendations. The CENIPA report includes a "Conclusions" section that summarizes the known facts and lists a variety of contributing factors relating to both air traffic controllers and the Legacy jet's flight crew. According to CENIPA, the air traffic controllers contributed to the accident by originally issuing an improper clearance to the Embraer, and not catching or correcting the mistake during the subsequent handoff to Brasília Center or later on. CENIPA also found errors in the way the controllers handled the loss of radar and radio contact with the Embraer.

CENIPA concluded that the ExcelAire pilots also contributed to the accident with, among other things, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.

The <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">NTSB</a> issued its own report on the accident, which was also appended to the CENIPA report with the following Probable Cause statement:
The evidence collected during this investigation strongly supports the conclusion that this accident was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision. The loss of effective air traffic control was not the result of a single error, but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts.

The NTSB further added the following contributing factors:
Contributing to this accident was the undetected loss of functionality of the airborne collision
avoidance system technology as a result of the inadvertent inactivation of the transponder on board N600XL. Further contributing to the accident was inadequate communication between ATC and the N600XL flight crew.

<a href="Aeronautical%20Accidents%20Investigation%20and%20Prevention%20Center">CENIPA</a> and the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">NTSB</a> collaborated in the accident investigation and, while agreeing on most of the basic facts and findings, the two organizations arrived at conflicting interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concluded that the accident was caused by mistakes made both by <a href="air%20traffic%20control">ATC</a> and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB report focused on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed on a collision course by the air traffic controllers.

According to "<a href="Aviation%20Week">Aviation Week</a>", "the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) strongly disagreed with the Brazilian conclusions regarding the Legacy pilots' actions as a causal factor, noting, 'The crew flew the route precisely as cleared and complied with all ATC instructions,' as did the GOL airlines crew." "Aviation Week" adds that "the Brazilian military operates that country's air traffic control system, conducted the investigation and authored the report."

The crash of Flight 1907 precipitated a major crisis in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>'s <a href="civil%20aviation">civil aviation</a> system, which included lengthy flight delays and cancellations, ATC <a href="work-to-rule">work-to-rule</a> slowdowns and strikes, and public safety concerns about Brazil's airport and air traffic infrastructure.

Historically, Brazil was <a href="Military%20dictatorship%20%28Brazil%29">ruled by its armed forces</a> from 1964 until 1985. Since then, a <a href="History%20of%20Brazil%20since%201985">civilian government</a> has taken over, but the country's airways () continued to be controlled and operated by the <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a> ("FAB") and run by its generals, overseen by a civilian defense minister. Most of Brazil's air traffic controllers are military <a href="non-commissioned%20officers">non-commissioned officers</a>, and all <a href="Area%20Control%20Center">Area Control Center</a>s are run by the FAB.
In October 2006, as details surrounding the crash of Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed to be at least partly focused on possible ATC errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor <a href="English%20as%20a%20foreign%20or%20second%20language">English skills</a>, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in the crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.

Amid rising tensions, the air traffic controllers began staging a series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, and even a <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a>. This led to chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.

On 26 July 2007, after an even deadlier crash in Brazil (<a href="TAM%20Airlines%20Flight%203054">TAM Airlines Flight 3054</a> on 17 July 2007) claimed the lives of 199 people, President <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> fired his defense minister, <a href="Waldir%20Pires">Waldir Pires</a>, who had been in charge of the country's aviation infrastructure and safety since March 2006, and was widely criticized for their failures. On the same day, Lula appointed former <a href="Supreme%20Federal%20Tribunal">Supreme Court</a> president <a href="Nelson%20Jobim">Nelson Jobim</a> to replace Pires, and vowed to improve Brazil's ATC system.

On 6 November 2006, the families of ten of the deceased filed a lawsuit for negligence against <a href="ExcelAire">ExcelAire</a> and <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a>, alleging that the ExcelAire pilots were flying at an "incorrect altitude" and that the Honeywell transponder was not functioning at the time of the collision. Other suits were subsequently filed on behalf of other victims, with similar allegations against ExcelAire and Honeywell. The victims' families also filed suits against other U.S. based defendants, including the two Embraer pilots, as well as <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a> and Amazon Tech (manufacturers of Brazil's ATC equipment), and ACSS (manufacturer of the Embraer's <a href="TCAS">TCAS</a>).

The attorney representing the Embraer crew, Miami-based Robert Torricella, responded to the allegation that the crew was flying at an "incorrect altitude" by stating that according to international regulations, clearances and directives issued by ATC supersede a previously filed flight plan, and in this case:... the flight plan cleared by air traffic control at the time of departure required the Embraer to fly all the way to Manaus at 37,000 feet and, absent contrary directives from air traffic control, the Embraer was obligated to follow its cleared flight plan. As the findings of the investigation are made public, we are confident that ExcelAire's pilots will be exonerated.
A Honeywell spokesperson stated that "Honeywell is not aware of any evidence that indicates that its transponder on the Embraer Legacy was not functioning as designed or that Honeywell was responsible for the accident."

On 2 July 2008, <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court">U.S. District Court</a> judge <a href="Brian%20Cogan">Brian Cogan</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20New%20York">Eastern District of New York</a> dismissed the families' suits against all the U.S. based defendants under the premise of "<a href="forum%20non-conveniens">forum non-conveniens</a>". Without ruling on the merits of the cases, and while allowing <a href="Discovery%20%28law%29">discovery</a> to continue, Cogan recommended the Brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for the dispute.

On 1 June 2007, Murilo Mendes, a Brazilian federal judge in the small city of <a href="Sinop%2C%20Mato%20Grosso">Sinop, Mato Grosso</a>, near the crash site of the Boeing, indicted the two Embraer pilots and four Brasília-based air traffic controllers for "exposing an aircraft to danger." On 8 December 2008, he dismissed charges of negligence against the pilots, but left in place a charge of "imprudence". He also dismissed all charges against two of the four Brasília-based controllers and reduced the charges against the other two, but supported bringing new charges against a fifth controller, based in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jos%C3%A9%20dos%20Campos">São José dos Campos</a>, the Embraer's departure point. On 12 January 2010, his ruling was overturned by Judge Candido Ribeiro in a federal court in Brasília, reinstating the negligence charges against the pilots.

On 26 October 2010, a military court convicted air traffic controller Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, sentencing him to 14 months in jail for failing to take action when he saw that the Embraer's anti-collision system had been turned off. Santos will remain free pending the outcome of the appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.

On 16 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced the two pilots to four years and four months of prison in a "semi-open" facility for their role in the collision, but he commuted the sentences to community service to be served in the United States. Brazilian authorities accused the pilots of turning off the Legacy's transponder moments before the accident and turning it on again only after the crash, but it was denied by the crew in a deposition via videoconference. Mendes said in his sentence that pilots had failed to verify the functioning of equipment for more than an hour, a length of time he called "an eternity" in aviation. On 9 October 2012, Brazilian federal prosecutors announced that they had successfully appealed the sentence of the pilots, asking to increase their sentences by 17 months (a total of 5 years and 9 months). The new trial was scheduled for 15 October, with the pilots again facing trial in absentia. On that date, the court upheld the prior convictions, but modified the sentences to 37 months for each, requiring that the pilots "report regularly to authorities and stay home at night."

The Embraer Legacy 600, registration N600XL, remained impounded at Cachimbo air base for almost three years, but in mid-2009 American company General Aviation Services agreed to buy the aircraft. The company partnered with Gantt Aviation and Constant Aviation to check and prepare the Legacy for its transfer to the United States. Once the work was completed, the aircraft was re-registered as N965LL, and on 19 November 2010 (more than four years after the accident) it finally arrived at <a href="Cleveland%20International%20Airport">Cleveland International Airport</a> to be refurbished and put up for sale.

The Legacy was reported to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. It was sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.

In 2007 <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> Brazil aired "A Tragédia do Vôo 1907" ("The Tragedy of Flight 1907"), a documentary about the disaster.

The Mato Grosso mid-air collision was featured in "Phantom Strike", a <a href="List%20of%20Mayday%20episodes%23Season%205%20%282008%29">Season 5 (2008)</a> episode of the Canadian TV series "<a href="Mayday%20%28Canadian%20TV%20series%29">Mayday</a>" (called "Air Emergency" and "Air Disasters" in the United States and "Air Crash Investigation" in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatization was broadcast with the title "Death over the Amazon" in the U.S. and "Radio Silence" in the United Kingdom.

The flight was also included in a "Mayday" <a href="List%20of%20Mayday%20episodes%23Season%208%20%282009%29%20Special">Season 8 (2009) "Science of Disaster"</a> special titled "System Breakdown", which looked at the role of air traffic controllers in aviation disasters.

Fusō-class battleship

The were a pair of <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Both patrolled briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war's end. In 1922, became the first battleship in the IJN to successfully launch aircraft.

During the 1930s, both ships underwent a series of modernizations and reconstructions. underwent her modernization in two phases (1930–33, 1937–41), while "Yamashiro" was reconstructed from 1930 to 1935. The modernization increased their armor, replaced and upgraded their machinery, and rebuilt their <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>s into the distinctive <a href="pagoda%20mast">pagoda mast</a> style. Despite the expensive reconstructions, both vessels were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II, and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war. "Fusō" served as a troop transport in 1943, while "Yamashiro" was relegated to training duty in the Inland Sea. Both underwent upgrades to their anti-aircraft suite in 1944 before transferring to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in August 1944.

"Fusō" and "Yamashiro" were the only two Japanese battleships at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>, the southernmost action of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, and both were lost in the early hours of 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that "Fusō" broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for "Yamashiro"; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral <a href="Sh%C5%8Dji%20Nishimura">Shōji Nishimura</a> went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.

The design of the "Fusō"-class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters. The IJN's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905, the last year of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>.

In the aftermath, the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean: Britain and the United States. <a href="Sat%C5%8D%20Tetsutar%C5%8D">Satō Tetsutarō</a>, a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist, speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals. To that end, he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70% as many capital ships as the US Navy. This ratio, Satō theorized, would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict. Accordingly, the 1907 Imperial Defense Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships, each, and eight modern <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, each. This was the genesis of the <a href="Eight-Eight%20Fleet%20Program">Eight-Eight Fleet Program</a>, the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships.

The launch of in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes, and complicated Japan's plans. Displacing and armed with ten guns, "Dreadnought" rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison. The launch of the battlecruiser the following year was a further setback for Japan's quest for parity. When the two new s and two armored cruisers, launched by 1911, were outclassed by their British counterparts, the Eight-Eight Fleet Program was restarted.

The first battleships built for the renewed Eight-Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908. In 1910, the Navy put forward a request to the <a href="National%20Diet">Diet</a> (parliament) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once. Because of economic constraints, the proposal was cut first by the Navy Ministry to seven battleships and three battlecruisers, then by the cabinet to four armored cruisers and a single battleship. The Diet amended this by authorizing the construction of four battlecruisers (the ) and one battleship, later named "Fusō", in what became the Naval Emergency Expansion bill.

"Fusō" was designed to work in conjunction with the four battlecruisers. After coordination with the British on the "Kongō" class, Japanese designers had access to the latest British design studies in naval architecture and were now able to design their own capital ships. In an effort to outmatch the American , planners called for a ship armed with twelve guns and faster than the of their rivals. <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> files show that the Japanese had access to the designs for double- and triple-gun turrets, yet opted for six double turrets over four triple turrets.

The final design—designated A-64 by the IJN—called for a displacement of with twelve guns in six double turrets (two forward, two aft, two separated amidships) with a top speed of . This design was superior to its American counterparts in armament, armor and speed, thus following the doctrine the Japanese had used since the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–95 of compensating for quantitative inferiority with qualitative superiority.

The ships had a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of . They <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a>. Their crew consisted of 1,198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and 1,396 in 1935. During World War II, the crew probably totalled around 1,800–1,900 men.

During the ships' modernization during the 1930s, their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod foremasts. The rear superstructures were rebuilt to accommodate mounts for <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) guns and additional <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control directors</a>. Both ships were also given <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a>s to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor. In addition, their sterns were lengthened by . These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to and their draft to . Their displacement increased nearly to at deep load.

The "Fusō"-class ships had two sets of <a href="John%20Brown%20and%20Company">Brown-Curtis</a> direct-drive <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The medium-pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the high- and low-pressure turbines drove the inner shafts. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara-type <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ships had a stowage capacity of of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, giving them a range of at a speed of . Both ships exceeded their designed speed of during their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s; "Fusō" reached from and "Yamashiro" exceeded that with from .

During their 1930s modernization, the Miyahara boilers on each ship were replaced by six new Kanpon oil-fired boilers, fitted into the former aft boiler room, and the forward <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> was removed. The Brown-Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of . On her trials, "Fusō" reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at a speed of .

The twelve 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="Vickers%2014%20inch/45%20naval%20gun">14-inch</a> guns of the "Fusō" class were mounted in six twin-gun turrets, numbered from front to rear, each of which weighed . The turrets had an elevation capability of −5/+20 degrees. They were arranged in an uncommon 2-1-1-2 style with <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> pairs of turrets fore and aft; the middle turrets were not superfiring, and had a funnel between them. The decision to use six twin turrets rather than four triple turrets greatly affected the entire design of the class because the two extra turrets required a longer ship and increased the amount of armor required to protect the ship. The location of the third and fourth turrets proved particularly problematic to the design of the class because the amidships turrets were not superfiring as in the subsequent s. This further increased the length of the ships because the barrels of the upper turret did not protrude over the lower turret, requiring more space than a pair of superfiring turrets. Mounted amidships along the centerline of the ship, they had restricted arcs of fire, and their position forced the boiler rooms to be placed in less than ideal locations. Another complication was the need to fit extra insulation and air conditioning in the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s of the amidships turrets to protect them from the heat generated in the adjacent boiler rooms. Originally both amidship gun turrets faced to the rear, but "Fusō"s turret No. 3 was moved to face forward during her reconstruction in order to accommodate additional platforms around her funnel.

The main battery of the "Fusō" class underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first reconstruction of both vessels, the elevation of the main guns was increased to −5/+43 degrees, giving a maximum firing range of . The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.

By World War II, the guns used Type 91 <a href="Armour-piercing%20capped%23Armor-piercing">armor-piercing, capped shells</a>. Each of these shells weighed and had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . They had a maximum range of at +30 degrees of elevation and at +43 degrees after modernization. Also available was a <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29%23High-explosive">high-explosive shell</a> that had a muzzle velocity of . A special Type 3 "<a href="San%20Shiki%20%28anti-aircraft%20shell%29">Sankaidan</a>" incendiary <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel shell</a> was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use.
As built, the "Fusō" class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber <a href="15%20cm/50%2041st%20Year%20Type">six-inch guns</a> mounted in single <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s along the sides of the hull at the level of the upper deck. Eight guns were mounted per side, and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of +15 degrees. Each gun could fire a high-explosive projectile a maximum distance of at a rate of between four and six shots per minute. During their reconstruction in the 1930s, the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to +30 degrees, which increased their maximum range by approximately .

The ships also mounted five or six 40-caliber <a href="8%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcm/40%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">76 mm</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft (AA)</a> guns. The high-angle guns were in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure, both sides of the second funnel, and each side of the aft superstructure ("Fusō" lacked the starboard side aft gun). Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of . Both ships were equipped with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, three on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>.

The "Fusō" class's secondary armament changed significantly over time. During the modernizations of the 1930s, all of the 76 mm guns were replaced with eight 40-caliber <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s. These guns were fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. During reconstruction, the two foremost 152 mm guns were also removed.

The light AA armament of the "Fusō" class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944. During the first reconstruction, "Fusō" was fitted with four quadruple machine-guns, while "Yamashiro" was fitted with eight twin gun mounts. Both weapons were license-built French <a href="Hotchkiss%20et%20Cie">Hotchkiss</a> designs. The 25 mm guns were mounted on the "Fusō" class in single, double and triple mounts. This model was the standard Japanese light anti-aircraft gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. The twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast". The configuration of the anti-aircraft guns varied significantly; by the end of their final reconstruction, the "Fusō" class mounted eight twin mounts. In 1943, seventeen single and two twin-mounts were added for a total of 37. In August 1944, both were fitted with another twenty-three single, six twin and eight triple-mounts, for a total of 95 anti-aircraft guns in their final configuration.

When the "Fusō" class was completed, the ships' armor was "typical for a pre-<a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Jutland</a> battleship". As built, the armor accounted for a displacement of , approximately 29% of the class's total displacement. Their <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was thick; below it was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates. The sides of the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> were thick. Additionally, the vessels contained 737 watertight compartments (574 underneath the armor deck, 163 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

During their reconstruction, the armor of the battleships was substantially upgraded. Their deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of , and a longitudinal <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> of of high-tensile steel was added to improve the underwater protection. This brought the total armor tonnage up to , approximately 31% of the total displacement of the "Fusō" class. Even after these improvements, the armor was still incapable of withstanding 14-inch shells.

"Yamashiro" was briefly fitted with an aircraft <a href="flight%20deck">flying-off platform</a> on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched <a href="Gloster%20Sparrowhawk">Gloster Sparrowhawk</a> and <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> <a href="fighter%20%28aircraft%29">fighters</a> from it, becoming the first Japanese ship to launch aircraft. When she was modernized in the 1930s, a <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> and a collapsible <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> were fitted on the stern, and both ships were equipped to operate three <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s, although no <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was provided. The initial <a href="Nakajima%20E4N">Nakajima E4N2</a> biplanes were replaced by <a href="Nakajima%20E8N">Nakajima E8N2</a> biplanes in 1938 and then by <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a> biplanes from 1942 on.

When completed in 1915, the ships had two and two <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s in the forward superstructure, a rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5. In late 1917 a <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was installed on a platform on the <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. The 4.5-meter rangefinders were replaced by instruments in 1923. During "Fusō"s first modernization, four directors for the 12.7 cm AA guns were added, one on each side of the fore and aft superstructures, and an eight-meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast. This was replaced by a rangefinder during 1938. At the same time, the two 3.5-meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25 mm AA guns. Additional 25 mm directors were installed on platforms on each side of the funnel.

While the ships were in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in July 1943, <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20World%20War%20II%20radar%23Shipborne%20radar">Type 21</a> air search <a href="radar">radar</a> was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning radar</a> units were fitted. "Yamashiro" mounted hers on the mainmast, while "Fusō" was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.

Two advanced versions of the class were planned, but the final design differed so markedly from "Fusō" that they became the "Ise" class. When she was completed in 1915, "Fusō" was considered the first modern battleship of the Japanese Navy. She outclassed her American counterparts of the in firepower and speed, and was considered the "most powerfully armed battleship in the world". Despite extensive modernization in the 1930s, both battleships were considered obsolescent by the commencement of World War II. Following the loss of much of Japan's aircraft carrier fleet by 1943, a proposal was floated that would have converted both vessels into hybrid battleship-carriers. Work was scheduled to commence in June 1943, but the plan was cancelled and the two "Ise"-class battleships were converted instead.

"Fusō" was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 8 November 1915 and assigned to the 1st Division of the <a href="1st%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Fleet</a> on 13 December. The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in Asia by the time she was completed. She served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918, and patrolled off the coast of China during that time. The ship aided survivors of the Great Kanto Earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923. In the 1920s, "Fusō" conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve. After assignment as a training ship in 1936 and 1937, she briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939.

"Yamashiro" was completed on 31 March 1917 and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War I. Like her sister, she patrolled off the coast of China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a>, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. "Yamashiro" became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled <a href="Kawanishi%20E7K">Kawanishi E7K2</a> floatplanes.

In April and May 1941, "Fusō" and "Yamashiro" were attached to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet, but the two ships spent most of the war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from <a href="Hashirajima">Hashirajima</a> to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">1st Air Fleet</a> attacking <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, they pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>. Commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Shir%C5%8D%20Takasu">Shirō Takasu</a>, the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a> (<a href="Operation%20MI">Operation MI</a>).

Afterwards, "Yamashiro" returned to home waters, where she stayed until August 1943; the next month, she became a training ship for midshipmen. In July 1943, "Yamashiro" was at the Yokosuka drydock, then was briefly assigned as a training ship on 15 September before loading troops on 13 October bound for <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> Naval Base, arriving on the 20th. She sailed for Japan on 31 October. On 8 November, the submarine fired torpedoes at "Junyo" that missed, but hit "Yamashiro" with a torpedo that failed to detonate. Returning to Japanese waters, "Yamashiro" resumed her training duties.

During the <a href="invasion%20of%20Saipan">US invasion of Saipan</a> in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting to reinforce the defenses were sunk by submarines. <a href="Shigenori%20Kami">Shigenori Kami</a>, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command "Yamashiro" to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship before it could be sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After <a href="Ry%C5%ABnosuke%20Kusaka">Ryūnosuke Kusaka</a>, <a href="Chief%20of%20staff%20%28military%29">Chief of Staff</a> of the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, also volunteered to go, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Hideki%20T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">Hideki Tōjō</a> approved the plan, known as Operation "Y-GO", but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> on 19 and 20 June.

"Fusō" was assigned to the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Naval%20Academy">Imperial Japanese Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Etajima%2C%20Hiroshima">Etajima, Hiroshima</a>, for use as a training ship between 15 November 1942 and 15 January 1943. On 8 June, she rescued 353 survivors from "Mutsu" when that ship exploded at Hashirajima. After carrying supplies to Truk Naval Base in August, "Fusō" made for <a href="Eniwetok">Eniwetok</a> two months later to be in a position to intercept an anticipated attack, returning to Truk on October 26. She arrived on 21 February at <a href="Lingga%20Island">Lingga Island</a>, and was employed there as a training ship, before refitting at Singapore between 13 and 27 April and returning to Lingga. She was transferred to <a href="Tawi-Tawi">Tawi-Tawi</a> on 11 May, and provided cover for the abortive attempts to <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">reinforce Biak Island</a> at the end of the month. "Fusō" sailed to <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan Island</a> off <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> to refuel in early July before returning to Japan, escaping an attack by the submarine . She was refitted in early August at Kure.

Both ships were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the <a href="2nd%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">2nd Fleet</a> on 10 September. "Yamashiro" and "Fusō" alternated in the role of division <a href="flagship">flagship</a> under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura. They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga Island, carrying the Army's <a href="25th%20Independent%20Mixed%20Regiment">25th Independent Mixed Regiment</a>, and escaped an attack by the submarine the next day. They arrived on 4 October, then transferred to Brunei to offload their troops and refuel in preparation for Operation "Shō-Gō", the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the <a href="invasion%20of%20Luzon">invasion of Luzon</a>.

Nishimura's "Southern Force" left <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east into the <a href="Sulu%20Sea">Sulu Sea</a> and then to the northeast into the <a href="Mindanao%20Sea">Mindanao Sea</a>. Intending to join Vice-Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>'s force in <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a>, they passed west of <a href="Mindanao%20Island">Mindanao Island</a> into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers lying in wait. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a> would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

At 09:08 on 24 October, "Yamashiro", "Fusō" and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> spotted a group of 27 planes, including <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s and <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">Curtiss SB2C Helldiver</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s escorted by <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a> fighters, that had been launched from the carrier . Around 20 sailors on "Yamashiro" were killed by strafing and rocket attacks. "Fusō" catapult and both floatplanes were destroyed, and another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks, killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery.

Nishimura issued a telegram to Admiral <a href="Soemu%20Toyoda">Soemu Toyoda</a> at 20:13: "It is my plan to charge into Leyte Gulf to [reach] a point off Dulag at 04:00 hours on the 25th." At 22:52, his force spotted three or four <a href="Motor%20Torpedo%20Boat">Motor Torpedo Boat</a>s and opened fire, damaging and and forcing all of them to retreat before they could launch their torpedoes.

One or two torpedoes, possibly fired by the destroyer , hit "Fusō" amidships on the starboard side at 03:09 on the 25th; she listed to starboard, slowed down, and fell out of formation. Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed that "Fusō" broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but they specifically mentioned only the size of the fire on the water, and not any details of the ship. Historian <a href="John%20Toland%20%28author%29">John Toland</a> agreed in 1970 that "Fusō" had broken in two, but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009, "Fuso was torpedoed, and as a result of progressive flooding, upended and capsized within forty minutes." She sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a few dozen men survived her rapid descent and massive oil fire, and only ten reached shore.

At 03:52, "Yamashiro" was attacked by a large formation to the north commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Jesse%20Oldendorf">Jesse Oldendorf</a>. First came 6- and shells from a line of eight cruisers, then and shells from a line of six battleships. The main bombardment lasted 18 minutes, and "Yamashiro" was the only target for seven minutes. The first rounds hit the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and pagoda mast, and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze. "Yamashiro" two forward turrets targeted her assailants, and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing "Mogami" and the destroyer . There was a big explosion at 04:04, possibly from one of the middle turrets. She was hit between 04:03 and 04:09 near the starboard engine room by a torpedo, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: "We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre-arranged. Please rest assured." At the same time, Oldendorf issued a cease-fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer was taking <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>, and the Japanese ships also ceased fire.

"Yamashiro" increased speed, but she had been hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.

Tylopilus felleus

Tylopilus felleus, commonly known as the bitter bolete or the bitter tylopilus, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> of the <a href="Boletaceae">bolete family</a>. Its distribution includes east Asia, Europe, and eastern North America, extending south into Mexico and Central America. A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, it grows in <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> woodland, often fruiting under <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a>. Its <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> have convex to flat <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that are some shade of brown, <a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>, or <a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a>, and typically measure up to in diameter. The pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish with age. Like most boletes it lacks a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>, and it may be distinguished from "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" and other similar species by its unusual pink pores and the prominent dark brown netlike pattern on its <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a>.

French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> described this species as "Boletus felleus" in 1788 before it was transferred into the new genus "<a href="Tylopilus">Tylopilus</a>". It is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Tylopilus", and the only member of the genus found in Europe. "Tylopilus felleus" has been the subject of research into <a href="biological%20activity">bioactive</a> compounds that have been tested for antitumour and <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> properties. Although not <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>, it is generally considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">inedible</a> due to its overwhelming bitterness.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in the scientific literature as "le bolet chicotin" ("Boletus felleus") by French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> in 1788. As the large genus "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>" was carved up into smaller genera, <a href="Petter%20Adolf%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> transferred it in 1881 to "<a href="Tylopilus">Tylopilus</a>", a genus diagnosed by its pink spores and <a href="adnation">adnate</a> tubes. "T. felleus" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Tylopilus", and the only member of the genus found in Europe. <a href="Synonym%20%28biology%29">Synonyms</a> include "Boletus alutarius", described by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1815 and later by <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Gottlieb%20Rostkovius">Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb Rostkovius</a> in 1844, and <a href="Paul%20Christoph%20Hennings">Paul Christoph Hennings</a>'s subsequent transfer of Fries's taxon into "Tylopilus", "T. alutarius". <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> placed the taxon in "Dictyopus" in 1886 and then "Rhodoporus" in 1888, but neither of these genera are recognised today, the former having been merged into "Boletus" and the latter into "Tylopilus". <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Genetic analysis</a> published in 2013 shows that "T. felleus" and many (but not all) other members of "Tylopilus" form a "Tylopilus" <a href="clade">clade</a> within a larger group informally called anaxoboletus in the <a href="Boletineae">Boletineae</a>. Other clades in the group include the porcini and "<a href="Strobilomyces">Strobilomyces</a>" clades, as well as three other groups composed of members of various genera including "<a href="Xerocomus">Xerocomus</a>", "<a href="Xerocomellus">Xerocomellus</a>" and "<a href="Boletus%20badius">Boletus badius</a>" and relatives.

A <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> described from the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region, var. "uliginosus", was recognised by <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> and <a href="Harry%20D.%20Thiers">Harry D. Thiers</a> in 1971 on the basis of its microscopic features, a distinction supported by Professor C.B. Wolfe of Pennsylvania State University. However, "<a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a>" does not consider this an independent taxon. Similarly, "Boletus felleus" var. "minor", published originally by <a href="William%20Chambers%20Coker">William Chambers Coker</a> and A.H. Beers in 1943 (later transferred to "Tylopilus" by <a href="Albert%20Pil%C3%A1t">Albert Pilát</a> and <a href="Aurel%20Dermek">Aurel Dermek</a> in 1974), has been folded into synonymy with "T. felleus". <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> described "Boletus felleus" var. "obesus" in 1889, but no record of a <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> exists. Although some records exist of "T. felleus" in Australia, their spores are of consistently smaller dimensions and this taxon has been classified as a separate species, "<a href="Tylopilus%20brevisporus">T. brevisporus</a>".

"Tylopilus felleus" derives its <a href="botanical%20name">genus name</a> from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "tylos" "bump" and "pilos" "hat", and its specific name from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "fel" meaning "bile" referring to its bitter taste, similar to <a href="bile">bile</a>. The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "bitter bolete" or the "bitter tylopilus".

The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of this species grows up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, though some North American specimens reach 30 cm (12 in) across. Grey-yellow to pale- or walnut-brown, it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre. It is initially convex before flattening out with maturity. The cap skin does not peel away from the flesh. The pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity. They are adnate to the stalk and bulge downwards as the mushroom ages. The pores bruise <a href="carmine%20%28color%29">carmine</a> or brownish, often developing rusty-brown spots with age, and number about one or two per millimetre. The tubes are long relative to the size of the cap, measuring deep in the middle part of the cap. The <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in the upper part; the lower part of the stalk remains swollen, sometimes shrinking at the base where it attaches to the <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. It measures —rarely to —tall, and wide, and can bulge out to across at the base. It is lighter in colour than the cap, and covered with a coarse brown network of markings, which have been likened to <a href="fishnet%20stockings">fishnet stockings</a> in appearance. Described as "very appetising" in appearance, the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is white or creamy, and pink beneath the <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a>; the flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut. It has a slight smell, which has been described as pleasant, as well as faintly unpleasant. The flesh is softer than that of other boletes, and tends to become more spongy as the mushroom matures. Insects rarely infest this species.
The colour of the <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. <a href="Spore">Spore</a>s are somewhat fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2 µm. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> on the walls of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granular</a> contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0 µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0 µm. The <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> of Smith and Thiers's variety "uliginosus", when <a href="Microscope%20slide%23Mounting">mounted</a> in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>, shows reddish globules of <a href="biological%20pigment">pigment</a> measuring 2–8 µm that appear in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12 µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.

Several <a href="chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> have been documented that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> turns the tissue pinkish, <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">iron salts</a> result in a colour change to greyish-green, <a href="aniline">aniline</a> causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and <a href="phenol">phenol</a> a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> causes an orange-salmon colour, <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a> creates orange-red, <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> usually makes brown, and a <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> solution usually makes orange.

Italian cook and author <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a> reports this is one of the most common fungi brought to him to identify, having been mistaken for an edible species. Young specimens can be confused with many edible boletes, though as the pores become more pink the species becomes easier to identify. Some guidebooks advocate tasting the flesh, the smallest piece of which will be very bitter. The dark-on-light reticulation in the stalk is distinctive, and is the opposite colouration of that on the stalk of the prized "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>". "T. felleus" is found in the same habitat as "B. badius", though the latter's yellow tubes and blue-bruising flesh easily distinguish it. "<a href="Boletus%20subtomentosus">B. subtomentosus</a>" can have a similar-coloured cap, but its yellow pores and slender stalk aid identification.

"<a href="Tylopilus%20rubrobrunneus">Tylopilus rubrobrunneus</a>", found in hardwood forests of eastern North America, is similar in appearance to "T. felleus", but has a purplish to purple-brown cap. It is also inedible due to its bitter taste. Another North American species, "<a href="Tylopilus%20variobrunneus">T. variobrunneus</a>", has a cap that is reddish-brown to chestnut-brown, with olive tones in youth. It has shorter spores than "T. felleus", typically measuring 9–13 by 3–4.5  μm. In the field, it can be distinguished from the latter species by its mild to slightly bitter taste. "<a href="Tylopilus%20rhoadsiae">T. rhoadsiae</a>", found in the southeastern United States, has a lighter-coloured cap that is smaller, up to in diameter. The edible "<a href="Tylopilus%20indecisus">T. indecisus</a>" and "<a href="Tylopilus%20ferrugineus">T. ferrugineus</a>" can be confused with "T. felleus", but have less reticulated stalks. The dimensions of the spores of the Australian species "T. brevisporus" range from 9.2 to 10.5 by 3.5 to 3.9 μm. "<a href="Tylopilus%20neofelleus">T. neofelleus</a>", limited in distribution to deciduous forests of China, New Guinea, Japan, and Taiwan, can be distinguished from "T. felleus" macroscopically by its <a href="wine%20%28color%29">vinaceous</a>-brown cap and pinkish-brown to vinaceous stalk, and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 11–14 by 4–5 μm) and longer pleurocystidia (49–107 by 14–24 μm).

Like all "Tylopilus" species, "T. felleus" is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l. It is found in <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> woodland, often under <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a> in well-drained <a href="soil%20pH">acid soils</a>, which can be sandy, gravelly or <a href="peat">peat</a>y. If encountered on <a href="Calcareous%23Calcareous%20soils">calcareous</a> (chalky) soil, it will be in moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample <a href="leaf%20litter">leaf litter</a>. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined at the base of the stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> requirements from <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s derived from the breakdown of <a href="protein">protein</a>s, although a lesser amount is obtained from the <a href="amino%20sugar">amino sugar</a> <a href="glucosamine">glucosamine</a> (a breakdown product of <a href="chitin">chitin</a>, a major component of fungal <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern <a href="temperate%20zones">temperate zones</a>. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety "uliginosus", known from <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, grows among <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s and <a href="moss">moss</a>es under <a href="pine">pine</a>s.

In North America, it is known from eastern Canada, south to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and west to <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> in the United States, and into Mexico and Central America. Its European distribution is widespread; it is relatively common in many regions, but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia, it has been recorded from the vicinity of <a href="Dashkin">Dashkin</a> in the <a href="Astore%20District">Astore District</a> of northern Pakistan, and as far east as China, where it has been recorded from <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a>, <a href="Jiangsu">Jiangsu</a>, <a href="Fujian">Fujian</a>, <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> and <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> provinces, and Korea.

The strong taste of the fruit body may have some role in insects avoiding it. The small fly species "<a href="Megaselia%20pygmaeoides">Megaselia pygmaeoides</a>" feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of "T. felleus" in North America, though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be <a href="parasitism">parasitized</a> by the mould "<a href="Sepedonium%20ampullosporum">Sepedonium ampullosporum</a>". Infection results in <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a> of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled <a href="conidia">conidia</a> produced by extrusion from the <a href="conidiophore">conidiophore</a>s).

The bacterium "<a href="Paenibacillus%20tylopili">Paenibacillus tylopili</a>" has been isolated from the <a href="mycorrhizosphere">mycorrhizosphere</a> of "T. felleus"; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect the activity of the microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that allow it to break down the <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a> chitin.

Fruit bodies of "T. felleus" have a high capacity to <a href="bioaccumulation">accumulate</a> <a href="Caesium-137">radioactive caesium</a> (Cs) from <a href="Radioactive%20contamination">contaminated</a> soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium. In contrast, the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope <a href="polonium-210">Po</a>.

As its common name suggests, it is extremely bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets ("<a href="tianguis">tianguis</a>") in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in <a href="skimmed%20milk">skimmed milk</a> after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene "<a href="TAS2R38">TAS2R38</a>" (<a href="taste%20receptor">taste receptor</a> 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.

The <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> of "Tylopilus felleus" can be grown in <a href="axenic">axenic</a> culture, on <a href="agar">agar</a> containing <a href="growth%20medium">growth medium</a>. The fungus can form fruit bodies if the temperature is suitable, and the light conditions simulate a 12-hour day. The mushrooms are usually deformed, often lacking stalks so that the cap grows directly on the surface, and the caps are usually in diameter. There are few Boletaceae species known to fruit in culture, as <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> plant.

Compounds from "T. felleus" have been extracted and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a <a href="beta-glucan">beta-glucan</a> that was isolated from the fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have <a href="Cytotoxicity">cytotoxic</a> properties and to stimulate <a href="innate%20immune%20system">non-specific immunological response</a>. In particular, it enhances <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>, the process by which <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s and <a href="granulocyte">granulocyte</a>s engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of "<a href="Propionibacterium%20acnes">Propionibacterium acnes</a>" in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme <a href="pancreatic%20lipase">pancreatic lipase</a>; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, "N"-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> activity.

West Indian cricket team in England in 1988

The <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indian cricket team</a> played 16 <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a> matches in England in 1988, under the <a href="Captain%20%28cricket%29">captaincy</a> of <a href="Viv%20Richards">Viv Richards</a>. The <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> enjoyed tremendous success during the tour, while <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> endured a "disastrous summer" of continuous change.

England easily won the initial three-match <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> (ODI) series, retaining the <a href="Texaco%20Trophy">Texaco Trophy</a> and raising expectations for a successful summer in the five-match <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> series to follow. However, the West Indies comfortably retained the <a href="Wisden%20Trophy">Wisden Trophy</a> by winning the Test series 4–0. This tour has become known in cricketing circles as the "summer of four captains" as England used four different <a href="English%20national%20cricket%20captains">captains</a> in the five Test matches.

By the summer of 1988, the West Indies had experienced nearly ten years as the best Test team in world cricket, including a streak of <a href="History%20of%20the%20West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%23Dominance%2C%20rebels%20and%20blackwashes%20%281980s%29">winning 10 of 11 Test series</a> they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was beginning to show signs of ageing. The experienced <a href="Batsman%20%28cricket%29">batsmen</a> <a href="Viv%20Richards">Viv Richards</a> (the captain), <a href="Gordon%20Greenidge">Gordon Greenidge</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Dujon">Jeff Dujon</a>, and <a href="Desmond%20Haynes">Desmond Haynes</a> were all coming to the end of their careers, and <a href="Bowler%20%28cricket%29">bowlers</a> <a href="Michael%20Holding">Michael Holding</a> and <a href="Joel%20Garner">Joel Garner</a> and batsman <a href="Larry%20Gomes">Larry Gomes</a> had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of <a href="Fast%20bowling">pace bowlers</a>. Supporting <a href="Malcolm%20Marshall">Malcolm Marshall</a>, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers <a href="Courtney%20Walsh">Courtney Walsh</a> (20 Tests), <a href="Patrick%20Patterson%20%28cricketer%29">Patrick Patterson</a> (11), <a href="Winston%20Benjamin">Winston Benjamin</a> (4), <a href="Curtly%20Ambrose">Curtly Ambrose</a> (3) and <a href="Ian%20Bishop%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201967%29">Ian Bishop</a> (0).

The West Indies' most recent series had been a hard-fought 1–1 draw at home <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20from%201980%E2%80%9381%20to%201990%23Pakistan%201987%E2%80%9388">against Pakistan</a>, but their previous two Test series against England had both resulted in 5–0 victories. The first of these, <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201984">in England in 1984</a>, was the first <a href="Whitewash%20%28sport%29">whitewash</a> England had suffered since the 1920–21 season when <a href="History%20of%20Australian%20cricket%20from%201918%E2%80%9319%20to%201930%23England%201920%E2%80%9321">England toured Australia</a>, while the second occurred in the Caribbean in <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20from%201980%E2%80%9381%20to%201990%23England%201985%E2%80%9386">1985–86</a>. These two one-sided victories by the West Indies became known as "blackwashes".

By contrast, the English team had suffered a run of bad performances spanning several years, winning only seven of their previous 52 Tests. The England side had most recently toured <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201987%E2%80%9388">Australia</a>, drawing the <a href="Bicentennial%20Test">Bicentennial Test</a> and losing the only <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> played, and <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20New%20Zealand%20from%201970%E2%80%9371%20to%202000%23England%201987%E2%80%9388">New Zealand</a>, drawing all three Test matches and sharing the ODIs 2–2. Before this, they had endured a "hostile" and highly controversial <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20Pakistan%20from%201986%20to%202000%23England%201987%E2%80%9388">tour of Pakistan</a>, during which an argument between captain <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a> and <a href="umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpire</a> <a href="Shakoor%20Rana">Shakoor Rana</a> had led to a diplomatic incident. The three match series was lost 1–0, but the "teasing, taunting ... bemusing" performance of <a href="leg-spinner">leg-spinner</a> <a href="Abdul%20Qadir%20%28cricketer%29">Abdul Qadir</a>, who took 30 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s in three Tests, was unlikely to be repeated, given that the West Indies' only specialist spinner was <a href="Roger%20Harper">Roger Harper</a>, an <a href="off-break">off-break</a> bowler.

Despite having lost 5–0 to the West Indies in each of the <a href="Blackwash">two most recent series</a>, England had grounds for optimism leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a <a href="leg-spin">leg-spin</a>ner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging following good performances in the <a href="Limited%20overs%20cricket">shorter form</a> of the game: the team had reached the <a href="1987%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">World Cup Final</a> the previous year, losing to <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>, and were expected to do well in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.

As the series unfolded, England were dominated by the West Indians in "the crazy summer of 1988". "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" was moved to comment "The morale and reputation of English cricket has seldom been as severely bruised as it was during the 1988 Cornhill Insurance Test series against West Indies".

The notability of there being four captains in just five Test matches can better be understood with context. The <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captain of a cricket team</a> performs a vital role. Unlike many other team sports, the captain makes crucial decisions regarding on-field tactics, and may also have an important say in team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, between 1977 and 1988 (comprising 104 Test matches), only <a href="English%20national%20cricket%20captains">seven different men</a> captained England, yet there were four captains in just a few weeks in the summer of 1988.

The many changes of captain over the summer reflected uncertainty in the English cricketing establishment as to how to respond to the drubbing the team was receiving from the West Indies; the selectors "did not seem to know where to turn, either for a new captain or for a settled team".

The England team had not suffered such uncertainty since the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201966">West Indies tour of England in 1966</a>, where the <a href="selector%20%28sport%29">selector</a>s chose 23 different players and three different captains (<a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a>, <a href="M.%20J.%20K.%20Smith">M. J. K. Smith</a> and <a href="Brian%20Close">Brian Close</a>) and England lost the five-Test series 3–1. Notably, <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a> was on the Board of Selectors for the 1966 series, while he was chairman of the board of Selectors for the 1988 series.

Before the Test series began, the West Indian cricket team played three One Day Internationals against England in May 1988. All of the ODIs were won by England, largely thanks to disciplined, economical bowling by <a href="Gladstone%20Small">Gladstone Small</a>, <a href="Phil%20DeFreitas">Phil DeFreitas</a> and <a href="Derek%20Pringle">Derek Pringle</a> throughout and good batting performances from <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a> in the First (82<a href="Not%20out">*</a>) and Third (40*) ODIs. England retained the <a href="Texaco%20Trophy">Texaco Trophy</a>.

The ODIs were followed by five Test matches. The First Test was drawn, and the remaining four Tests were all won convincingly by the West Indies.

The West Indies played 11 <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class matches</a>, in addition to the five Tests,
defeating <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> in May and <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> in June. The other nine first-class matches, and the First Test, were all drawn:
<a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>,

<a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>,
<a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>,

<a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>,
<a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>,

<a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>,
<a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>,

<a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>,
and <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>. During the match against Gloucestershire at <a href="County%20Cricket%20Ground%2C%20Bristol">Bristol</a>, immediately after the ODI series, <a href="Phil%20Simmons">Phil Simmons</a> suffered a horrific injury, receiving a ball to the head from bowler <a href="David%20Lawrence%20%28cricketer%29">David Lawrence</a>. Not wearing a <a href="cricket%20helmet">helmet</a>, the blow caused his heart to stop and he had to be taken to hospital where he underwent emergency brain surgery. He missed the rest of the tour, but made a full recovery in time for the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201991">1991 West Indies tour of England</a>.

In addition to the One Day Internationals, there were four other non-first-class fixtures. West Indies beat <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk%27s%20XI">Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI</a> in a 40-over match, <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> in a 50-over match and a combined <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a> Universities team over three days; they also drew with <a href="Minor%20Counties">Minor Counties</a> in a two-day match.

England won the Texaco Trophy 3-0.

<a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a> was the incumbent England captain for the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. The result was a draw, with <a href="Graham%20Gooch">Graham Gooch</a> and <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a> helping England to save the game from a position of weakness, after conceding a sizeable first-innings lead to the West Indies.

England won the toss and declined from 125/0 to 245 all out, the last five wickets tumbling for just 22 runs. <a href="Malcolm%20Marshall">Malcolm Marshall</a> and <a href="Curtly%20Ambrose">Curtly Ambrose</a> took all ten wickets between them. The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England had a chance to get back into the match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.

The West Indian surge for victory was frustrated by the weather, which periodically interrupted the match throughout, and by an obdurate partnership of 161 between Gooch (146) and Gower (88*).

Before the Second Test, Gatting was sacked for an alleged off-field indiscretion with a <a href="bartender">barmaid</a>. The <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> media made allegations of "shenanigans" in his room; he "admitted taking ... [her] into his room but denied anything untoward had happened". During the previous winter, Gatting had been involved in a notorious on-field altercation with umpire <a href="Shakoor%20Rana">Shakoor Rana</a> in Pakistan that snowballed into a diplomatic disaster with the third day of the second Test in <a href="Iqbal%20Stadium">Faisalabad</a> being abandoned and accusations of cheating. His recently published autobiography "Leading From The Front" "...was banned in all shops on county grounds. Gatting was good enough to lead Middlesex and England, but spectators couldn't buy his book at Lord's". The new allegations may simply have been the <a href="last%20straw">last straw</a>.

This proved to be Gatting's last match as captain. He had captained England in 23 Test matches since taking charge against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in 1986, but won only two.

Gatting was replaced as England captain by his <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> colleague <a href="John%20Emburey">John Emburey</a>. Gatting was also dropped from the team, replaced by <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire's</a> <a href="Martyn%20Moxon">Martyn Moxon</a>. <a href="Phil%20DeFreitas">Phil DeFreitas</a> was also replaced, by <a href="Gladstone%20Small">Gladstone Small</a>, but the tourists were unchanged.

England began the Second Test with an inspired fiery burst of fast bowling by <a href="Graham%20Dilley">Graham Dilley</a>, who took four of the first five wickets to fall to reduce the West Indies to 54/5. At lunch on the first day, Dilley had figures of 4/35, and "he would have taken five had <a href="Derek%20Pringle">Pringle</a> at first <a href="slip%20%28cricket%29">slip</a> caught <a href="Gus%20Logie">Logie</a> when he was 10".

The missed chance was to prove costly. The pattern established in the first Test recurred, as England let the West Indies recover, with <a href="Gus%20Logie">Gus Logie</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Dujon">Jeff Dujon</a> scoring 81 and 53 as the team passed 200.

In England's first innings, the West Indian pace attack found little resistance after they had dismissed Gooch and Gower. Marshall was again to the fore, with six wickets, and West Indies secured a precious first-innings lead of 44 runs.

The touring batsmen then enjoyed the Lord's conditions, reaching 397 in their second innings, with sizeable contributions from Greenidge (103), Richards (72), Dujon (52) and Logie again, this time with an unbeaten 95, a match performance that secured him the award of <a href="Man%20of%20the%20match">Man of the match</a>.

England never seriously threatened to reach the victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the <a href="List%20of%20Test%20cricket%20records%23Innings">world record</a> for a fourth-innings run chase. <a href="Allan%20Lamb">Allan Lamb</a> added to his reputation for mastering fast bowling with a defiant 113, but it was sizeable contributions from the <a href="Tail-end">tail</a> and <a href="Extra%20%28cricket%29">extras</a> that took England to a respectable total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.

The third Test changed the pattern of the summer. England were "unable to cope for any length of time with the West Indian fast bowlers" and never gave even a sign of competing in a one-sided affair.

The England team had a different look, with four changes to the team. 36-year-old <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> <a href="off-spin">off-spin</a>ner <a href="John%20Childs%20%28cricketer%29">John Childs</a> made his debut, the oldest England debutant for 40 years. Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer <a href="David%20Capel">David Capel</a>. Small and <a href="Paul%20Jarvis">Paul Jarvis</a> were both left out due to injury, and <a href="Derek%20Pringle">Derek Pringle</a> was dropped, but the most media attention focused on <a href="Chris%20Broad">Chris Broad</a>, who was also dropped, "ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, but there was always a suspicion that he was being disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision".

For West Indies, <a href="Desmond%20Haynes">Desmond Haynes</a> was unfit, ending a run of 72 consecutive caps. He was replaced by the spinner <a href="Roger%20Harper">Roger Harper</a>, and <a href="Patrick%20Patterson%20%28cricketer%29">Patrick Patterson</a> was replaced by <a href="Winston%20Benjamin">Winston Benjamin</a>.

No batsman scored more than 33 in England's first innings, as the four quick bowlers shared cheap wickets. In reply, West Indies piled up 384/7, again without a century, in a team effort down to and including man-of-the-match Marshall, who scored 43* batting at number eight.

Needing 249 to make West Indies bat again, England were dismissed for just 93, Marshall finishing with magnificent figures of 15.4–5–22–7, the best of his Test career. <a href="extra%20%28cricket%29">Extras</a> were the third highest scorer, with 12.

With such a huge margin of victory and such a poor performance, England (and Emburey) were strongly criticised. After being bowled out for just 93 runs, and a personally very unsuccessful match (no wickets as a bowler, and scoring just 1 and 8 runs as a batsman), Emburey was sacked as England captain and dropped from the team.

The England selectors surprised the cricket public with their new appointment as captain, selecting a player who many believed owed his appointment more to his father than his own ability. <a href="Chris%20Cowdrey">Chris Cowdrey</a> was the son of <a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a>, an England captain in the 1960s and later given a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> and then <a href="life%20peer">life peer</a>age for his services to the sport; Chris Cowdrey was also <a href="godson">godson</a> of the chairman of selectors, <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a>. Cowdrey was a successful captain of <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> in <a href="county%20cricket">county cricket</a>, but had played just five Tests previously, during the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20India%20and%20Sri%20Lanka%20in%201984%E2%80%9385">1984–85 tour to India</a>, captained by <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a>. He became only the second son to follow his father as captain of the England cricket team, after <a href="George%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">George Mann</a> in the 1940s followed <a href="Frank%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Mann</a> in the 1920s.

The England side was thoroughly shaken-up following the debacle in the Third Test at Old Trafford. The selectors tried to turn things around with seven new faces in the team, the most extensive change of an England XI during a Test series since seven players were changed for the 1921 <a href="the%20Ashes">Ashes</a> Tests against Australia at Lord's and Headingley (when only <a href="JWHT%20Douglas">JWHT Douglas</a>, <a href="Ciss%20Parkin">Ciss Parkin</a>, <a href="Lionel%20Tennyson">Lionel Tennyson</a> and <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a> were retained, and Tennyson replaced Douglas as captain). As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, the selectors also dropped <a href="Paul%20Downton">Paul Downton</a>, Martyn Moxon, Mike Gatting, David Capel, Phil Defreitas and John Childs in favour of Derek Pringle, <a href="Neil%20Foster">Neil Foster</a>, <a href="Bill%20Athey">Bill Athey</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Richards">Jack Richards</a>, with <a href="Tim%20Curtis">Tim Curtis</a> and <a href="Robin%20Smith%20%28cricketer%29">Robin Smith</a> making their Test debuts. For the West Indies, both Greenidge and Richardson sat the match out, injured: Haynes returned, and a debut was handed to Keith Arthurton. Jeff Dujon was promoted up the batting order as a makeshift opener.

Apart from Pringle, who played in the First and Second Tests, none of the six new selections had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance. The side fell to a relatively facile defeat against a West Indies team whose own batsmen failed to dominate; they had no need. Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets at a cost of 98 runs - despite being hampered early on in the match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being waterlogged and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation to the attention of the umpires so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.

An <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a> with a moderate first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as captain in the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium%23Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.

In desperation, the England selectors turned to 35-year-old <a href="Graham%20Gooch">Graham Gooch</a>, stalwart <a href="opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a>, as their fourth captain of the series, for the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. England also replaced Cowdrey with DeFreitas, dropped Gower for <a href="Matthew%20Maynard">Matthew Maynard</a>, and replaced the injured <a href="Allan%20Lamb">Allan Lamb</a> with <a href="Rob%20Bailey%20%28cricketer%29">Rob Bailey</a>, a recall and two Test debuts respectively. The tourists replaced the youngster <a href="Keith%20Arthurton">Keith Arthurton</a> with Greenidge, who had recovered from an injury.

England won the toss and the new captain received the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising than the fact that off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.

In England's second innings, Gooch played a lone hand. With the exception of Foster (34), promoted as <a href="Nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a> at the end of day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.

Gooch had enjoyed a successful series against West Indies as a batsman, and remained in charge for <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201988">England's next match</a>, against <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> at Lord's later in 1988, in which he achieved his first victory as captain. England did not tour that winter - in large part due to India's objection to Gooch as England captain thanks to his participation in the 1981 rebel tour of South Africa (for which he had served a three-year ban), and due to other English players having played club cricket in South Africa. Exceptions might have been made for the rank and file players (as indeed they had been for Gooch, when India raised no objection to his representing England in the 1987 World Cup), but for the Indian government, Gooch's appointment as captain of a representative tour party was a step too far. As a result, England's planned tour to India was cancelled, Gooch was dropped from the captaincy, and <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a> returned to the captaincy for the six-match <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes series</a> at home against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> in the summer of <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201989">1989</a>. England lost 4–0, bringing Gower's long captaincy career to a close. A second "rebel" tour of South Africa, under Gatting - whom some had previously supported for a return to the captaincy, rather than Gower - removed a number of players from the England reckoning halfway through the summer, some of them regulars and most with at least occasional England experience, as no less than 30 players were tried in the six-match series - beating the record of 28, set only the previous summer: the players involved (including John Emburey, the only player to go on both 1981 and 1989 rebel tours) received the same three-year international ban as the 1981 party.

Gooch thus took over again as England captain for the tour to West Indies in the winter of <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20in%201989%E2%80%9390">1989–90</a> (he had not played well in the 1989 Ashes, but there was really no other credible candidate as captain, and the West Indies made no objection, having officially ended the "life" bans of their own rebel South Africa tourists after six years) with only a couple of veterans in an otherwise almost new-look team: surprising everybody by winning one Test (their first victory over the Windies since 1974) and drawing another before injury forced him out of the team, his hand being broken by fast bowler Ezra Moseley - ironically, Moseley was the only one of West Indies' rebel tourists to play international cricket after their ban was lifted. Gooch was replaced as captain for the remainder of the series by <a href="Allan%20Lamb">Allan Lamb</a> (himself South African-born), who lost both of his matches in charge. Gooch went on to captain England the following summer against <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201990">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201990">India</a> at home, remaining in that position almost exclusively until 1993 and bringing England a degree of success that they had not experienced for almost a decade, at least at home: the 1991 home series against the West Indies, in fact, was a hard-fought 2-2 draw, and England reached the World Cup final for the second successive time the following winter (which was much less of a surprise - even when their Test record was at its worst, England were one of the leading one-day sides of the time, often winning the one-day series even when a Test series was lost, including both the otherwise disastrous 1988 and 1989 summers.) For much of this period, he was also rated as one of the world's leading batsmen. Away from home, though, England were not so strong, losing heavily to Australia in 1990-1 and to India and Sri Lanka in 1992-3, though these were either side of a series victory in New Zealand.

The West Indies team's next opposition was <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> where the team enjoyed a 3–1 <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201988%E2%80%9389">Test series win</a> on foreign soil, their only defeat in that series coming on a pitch friendly to spin bowling in which 11 wickets were taken by the occasional left-arm spin of Allan Border. "The West Indians made a slow start to their tour, losing twice to <a href="Western%20Warriors">Western Australia</a> before running into form ... So effectively, at times irresistibly, did Vivian Richards's West Indian side play in the first three Test matches in Australia that by the New Year they had already retained the <a href="Frank%20Worrell%20Trophy">Frank Worrell Trophy</a>."

The West Indies went on to record further Test series victories in the next two years, defeating <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> 3–0 in a four-Test series <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20in%201988%E2%80%9389">in the Caribbean in 1988–89</a>, and narrowly beating England once again <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20in%201989%E2%80%9390">in the Caribbean in 1989–90</a>. However, the team's long period of pre-eminence was coming to an end. For several of their senior players, the 1991 tour of England was a swansong: Richards, Marshall and Dujon all retired from Tests after the final match, while Greenidge had announced his intention to do likewise but was forced out of the tour by injury before the Tests began, and Logie also played his last Test on the tour. Nevertheless, the West Indies were to remain unbeaten in a Test series for a few more years yet, but never as dominant as they had been: and their <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20from%201990%E2%80%9391%20to%202000%23Australia%201994%E2%80%9395">2–1 home defeat</a> by Australia in 1994–95 saw the West Indies <a href="History%20of%20the%20West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%23Fall%20from%20grace%20%281990s%29">relinquish the mantle</a> as the World's best Test cricket side to their visitors, and by the time that the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a> launched the official Test rankings in 2001, the West Indies were rated as the sixth best team in the world.

The following players represented England in at least one Test or One-day International during the 1988 tour:

Paxillus involutus

Paxillus involutus, commonly known as the brown roll-rim, common roll-rim, or poison pax, is a <a href="basidiomycete">basidiomycete</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> that is widely distributed across the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. It has been inadvertently <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and South America, probably transported in soil with European trees. Various shades of brown in colour, the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> grows up to 6 cm (2.4 in) high and has a funnel-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to 12 cm (5 in) wide with a distinctive inrolled rim and <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> gills that may be pore-like close to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. Although it has <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, it is more closely related to the pored <a href="bolete">bolete</a>s than to typical gilled <a href="mushrooms">mushrooms</a>. It was first described by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> in 1785, and was given its current <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1838. Genetic testing suggests that "Paxillus involutus" may be a <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> rather than a single species.

A common mushroom of <a href="temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous</a> and <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> woods and grassy areas in late summer and autumn, "Paxillus involutus" forms <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l relationships with a broad range of tree species. These benefit from the <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> as the fungus reduces their intake of <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> and increases resistance to pathogens such as "<a href="Fusarium%20oxysporum">Fusarium oxysporum</a>". Previously considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> and eaten widely in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern</a> and <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, it has since been found to be dangerously <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>, after being responsible for the death of German mycologist <a href="Julius%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Julius Schäffer</a> in 1944. It had been recognised as causing gastric upsets when eaten raw, but was more recently found to cause potentially fatal <a href="autoimmune">autoimmune</a> <a href="hemolysis">hemolysis</a>, even in those who had consumed the mushroom for years without any other ill effects. An <a href="antigen">antigen</a> in the mushroom triggers the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to attack red blood cells. Serious and commonly fatal <a href="Complication%20%28medicine%29">complications</a> include <a href="Renal%20failure%23Acute%20renal%20failure">acute renal failure</a>, <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>, acute <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>, and <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>.

The brown roll-rim was described by French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> in 1785 as "Agaricus contiguus", although the 1786 combination "Agaricus involutus" of <a href="August%20Batsch">August Batsch</a> is taken as the first <a href="valid%20name%20%28botany%29">valid description</a>. <a href="James%20Bolton">James Bolton</a> published a description of what he called "Agaricus adscendibus" in 1788; the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> authority <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a> considers this to be <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonymous</a> with "P. involutus". Additional synonyms include "Omphalia involuta" described by <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> in 1821, and "Rhymovis involuta", published by <a href="Gottlob%20Ludwig%20Rabenhorst">Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst</a> in 1844. The species gained its current <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> erected the genus "<a href="Paxillus">Paxillus</a>", and set it as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. The starting date of fungal <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanction</a> by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered <a href="correct%20name%20%28botany%29">valid</a>. It was thus written "Paxillus involutus" (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. A 1987 revision of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>' seminal work, the "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>". Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.

The genus was later placed in a new family, <a href="Paxillaceae">Paxillaceae</a>, by French mycologist <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Maire">René Maire</a> who held it to be related to both <a href="agaric">agaric</a>s and boletes. Although it has gills rather than pores, it has long been recognised as belonging to the pored mushrooms of the order <a href="Boletales">Boletales</a> rather than the traditional agarics. The generic name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for 'peg' or 'plug', and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "involutus", 'inrolled', refers to the cap margin. <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include the naked brimcap, poison paxillus, inrolled pax, poison pax, common roll-rim, brown roll-rim, and brown chanterelle. Gray called it the "involved navel-stool" in his 1821 compendium of British flora.

Studies of the ecology and genetics of "Paxillus involutus" indicate that it may form a <a href="species%20complex">complex</a> of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries found that there were three populations of "P. involutus" unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. There were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study comparing the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s of specimens of "Paxillus involutus" collected from various habitats in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species "<a href="Paxillus%20vernalis">P. vernalis</a>", while those from forests were allied with "<a href="Paxillus%20filamentosus">P. filamentosus</a>". The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that "P. involutus" "<a href="sensu%20lato">sensu lato</a>" (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to "<a href="Paxillus%20obscurosporus">P. obscurosporus</a>", "P. involutus" "sensu stricto" (in the strict sense), "<a href="Paxillus%20validus">P. validus</a>", and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.

Resembling a brown wooden <a href="top">top</a>, the <a href="epigeous">epigeous</a> (aboveground) <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> may be up to 6 cm (2.4 in) high. The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, initially convex then more funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) with a depressed centre and rolled rim (hence the common name), may be reddish-, yellowish- or olive-brown in colour and typically 4–12 cm (1.6–5 in) wide; the cap diameter does not get larger than . The cap surface is initially downy and later smooth, becoming sticky when wet. The cap and cap margin initially serve to protect the <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> of young fruit bodies: this is termed pilangiocarpic development. The narrow brownish yellow gills are decurrent and forked, and can be peeled easily from the flesh (as is the case with the pores of boletes). Gills further down toward the stipe become more irregular and <a href="Anastomosis">anastomose</a>, and can even resemble the pores of bolete-type fungi. The fungus darkens when bruised and older specimens may have darkish patches. The juicy yellowish <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> has a mild to faintly sour or sharp odor and taste, and has been described as well-flavored upon cooking. Of similar colour to the cap, the short <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> can be crooked and tapers toward the base.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is brown, and the dimensions of the ellipsoid (oval-shaped) spores are 7.5–9 by 5–6 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>.
The <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> has <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> both on the gill edge and face (cheilo- and pleurocystidia respectively), which are slender and filament-like, typically measuring 40–65 by 8–10.5 μm.

The brownish colour and funnel-like shape of "P. involutus" can lead to its confusion with several species of "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>", many of which have some degree of toxicity themselves. The lack of a milky exudate distinguishes it from any milk cap. One of the more similar is "<a href="Lactarius%20turpis">L. turpis</a>", which presents a darker olive colouration. The related North American "Paxillus vernalis" has a darker spore print, thicker stipe and is found under aspen, whereas the closer relative "P. filamentosus" is more similar in appearance to "P. involutus". A rare species that grows only in association with <a href="alder">alder</a>, "P. filamentosus" can be distinguished from it by the pressed-down scales on the cap surface that point towards the cap margin, a light yellow flesh that bruises only slightly brown, and deep yellow-ochre gills that do not change colour upon injury

The most similar species are two once thought to be part of "P. involutus" in Europe. "Paxillus obscurosporus" has larger fruit bodies than "P. involutus", with caps up to wide whose margins tend to unroll and flatten with age, and a layer of cream-coloured mycelia covering the base of its tapered stipe. "P. validus", also known only from Europe, has caps up to wide with a stipe that is more or less equal in width throughout its length. Found under broadleaved trees in parks, it can be reliably distinguished from "P. involutus" (and other "Paxillus" species) by the presence of crystals up to 2.5 μm long in the <a href="Mycelial%20cord">rhizomorphs</a>, as the crystals found in rhizomorphs of other "Paxillus" species do not exceed 0.5 μm long.

"Paxillus involutus" forms <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l relationships with a number of <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialised nutrient requirements and a relatively broad <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where "P. involutus" was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine ("<a href="Pinus%20resinosa">Pinus resinosa</a>"), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus "<a href="Fusarium%20oxysporum">Fusarium oxysporum</a>". Seedlings inoculated with "P. involutus" also showed increased resistance to "Fusarium". Thus "P. involutus" may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. "Paxillus involutus" also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a> toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> to Scots pine ("<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">Pinus sylvestris</a>") seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with "P. involutus" decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s, as well as accumulating in the <a href="vacuole">vacuolar compartments</a>. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to <a href="copper">copper</a> or cadmium drastically increase production of a <a href="metallothionein">metallothionein</a>—a low <a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a> protein that binds metals.

The presence of "Paxillus involutus" is related to much reduced numbers of bacteria associated with the roots of "Pinus sylvestris". Instead bacteria are found on the external mycelium. The types of bacteria change as well; a Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under "P. sylvestris" without mycorrhizae metabolised <a href="organic%20acid">organic</a> and <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, while communities among "P. involutus" metabolised the sugar <a href="fructose">fructose</a>. "Paxillus involutus" benefits from the presence of some species of bacteria in the soil it grows in. As the fungus grows it excretes <a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s, waste products that are toxic to itself and impede its growth, but these compounds are metabolised by some bacteria, resulting in increased fungal growth. Bacteria also produce certain compounds such as <a href="citric%20acid">citric</a> and <a href="malic%20acid">malic acid</a>, which stimulate "P. involutus".
Highly abundant, the brown roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. It is equally widely distributed across northern North America, extending north to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where it has been collected from <a href="tundra">tundra</a> near <a href="Coldfoot%2C%20Alaska">Coldfoot</a> in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, "P. involutus" has been recorded under the birch species "<a href="Betula%20nana">Betula nana</a>", "<a href="Betula%20pubescens">B. pubescens</a>" and "<a href="Betula%20glandulosa">B. glandulosa</a>". The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch ("<a href="Betula%20pendula">Betula pendula</a>"). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside "<a href="Boletus%20badius">Boletus badius</a>" in Europe, and "<a href="Leccinum%20scabrum">Leccinum scabrum</a>" and "<a href="Lactarius%20plumbeus">Lactarius plumbeus</a>" in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch ("<a href="Betula%20papyrifera">Betula papyrifera</a>") in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>" plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around <a href="Oulu">Oulu</a> in northern Finland found that "P. involutus" became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.

"Paxillus involutus" can be found growing on <a href="lawn">lawn</a>s and old <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s throughout its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, though they may be found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by "<a href="Hypomyces%20chrysospermus">Hypomyces chrysospermus</a>", or bolete eater, a <a href="mould">mould</a> species that parasitises <a href="Boletales">Boletales</a> members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.

Australian mycologist <a href="John%20Burton%20Cleland">John Burton Cleland</a> noted it occurring under <a href="larch">larch</a> ("Larix"), oak, pine, birch and other <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> trees in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> in 1934, and it has subsequently been recorded in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> (where it was found near "Betula" and "Populus") and <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It has been recorded under introduced <a href="birch">birch</a> ("Betula") and <a href="hazel">hazel</a> ("Corylus") in New Zealand. Mycologist <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. It is likely to have been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.

"Paxillus involutus" was widely eaten in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> until World War II, although English guidebooks did not recommend it. In Poland, the mushroom was often eaten after pickling or salting. It was known to be a gastrointestinal irritant when ingested raw but had been presumed edible after cooking. Questions were first raised about its toxicity after German mycologist <a href="Julius%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Julius Schäffer</a> died after eating it in October 1944. About an hour after he and his wife ate a meal prepared with the mushrooms, Schäffer developed vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. His condition worsened to the point where he was admitted to hospital the following day and developed <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a>, perishing after 17 days.

In the mid-1980s, Swiss physician René Flammer discovered an <a href="antigen">antigen</a> within the mushroom that stimulates an <a href="autoimmune">autoimmune</a> reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own <a href="red%20blood%20cells">red blood cells</a> as foreign and attack them. Despite this, it was not until 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating "P. involutus", and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of "Paxillus" mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom for a long period of time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptom</a>s on previous occasions. The "Paxillus" syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of <a href="IgG">IgG</a> <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> in the <a href="blood%20serum">blood serum</a>. In the course of subsequent meals, <a href="immune%20complex">antigen-antibody complexes</a> are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their <a href="lysis">breakdown</a>.

Poisoning symptoms are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated <a href="hypovolemia">decreased blood volume</a>. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, <a href="hemolysis">hemolysis</a> develops, resulting in <a href="oliguria">reduced urine output</a>, <a href="hemoglobinuria">hemoglobin in the urine</a> or outright <a href="anuria">absence of urine formation</a>, and <a href="anemia">anemia</a>. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing for the presence of increasing <a href="bilirubin">bilirubin</a> and free hemoglobin, and falling <a href="haptoglobin">haptoglobin</a>s. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>, acute <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>, and <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>. These complications can cause significant <a href="disease%23Morbidity">morbidity</a> with fatalities having been reported.

There is no antidote for poisoning, only <a href="supportive%20treatment">supportive treatment</a> consisting of monitoring <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a>, renal function, blood pressure, and fluid and electrolyte balance and correcting abnormalities. The use of <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a>s may be a useful adjunct in treatment, as they protect blood cells against hemolysis, thereby reducing complications. <a href="Plasmapheresis">Plasmapheresis</a> reduces the circulating immune complexes in the blood which cause the hemolysis, and may be beneficial in improving the outcome. Additionally, <a href="hemodialysis">hemodialysis</a> can be used for patients with compromised renal function or renal failure.

"Paxillus involutus" also contains agents which appear to damage <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s; it is unclear whether these have <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>ic or <a href="mutagen">mutagen</a>ic potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the <a href="natural%20phenol">phenols</a> <a href="involutone">involutone</a> and <a href="involutin">involutin</a>; the latter is responsible for the brownish discolouration upon bruising.

Nico Ditch

Nico Ditch is a six-mile (9.7 km) long linear <a href="Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">earthwork</a> between <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a> and <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a> in Greater Manchester, England. It was dug as a defensive fortification, or possibly a boundary marker, between the 5th and 11th centuries.

The ditch is still visible in short sections, such as a stretch in <a href="Denton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Denton</a> Golf Course. In the parts which survive, the ditch is wide and up to deep. Part of the earthwork is protected as a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>.

The earliest documented reference to the ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in <a href="Audenshaw">Audenshaw</a> to the monks of the <a href="Kersal">Kersal Cell</a>. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as "Mykelldiche", and a "magnum fossatum", Latin for "large ditch".

The name Nico (sometimes Nikker) for the ditch became established in the 19th and 20th centuries. It may have been derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a> "<a href="Nickar">Hnickar</a>", a water spirit who seized and drowned unwary travellers, but the modern name is most likely a corruption of the name Mykelldiche and its variations, as the Anglo-Saxon word "micel" meant "big" or "great", harking back to the early 13th century description of the ditch as "magnum fossatum". An alternative derivation is that Nico comes from "nǽcan", an Anglo-Saxon verb meaning "kill".

Nico Ditch stretches between Ashton Moss () in Ashton-under-Lyne and Hough Moss (), just east of <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>. It passes through <a href="Denton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Denton</a>, <a href="Reddish">Reddish</a>, <a href="Gorton">Gorton</a>, <a href="Levenshulme">Levenshulme</a>, <a href="Burnage">Burnage</a>, <a href="Rusholme">Rusholme</a>, <a href="Platt%20Fields%20Park">Platt Fields Park</a> in <a href="Fallowfield">Fallowfield</a>, <a href="Withington">Withington</a> and <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy">Chorlton-cum-Hardy</a>, crossing four <a href="metropolitan%20borough">metropolitan borough</a>s of present-day <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. The ditch coincides with the boundaries between the boroughs of <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Stockport">Stockport</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and between Tameside and Manchester as far as Denton golf course. A section is now beneath the <a href="Audenshaw%20Reservoirs">Audenshaw Reservoirs</a>, which were built towards the end of the 19th century. The ditch may have extended west beyond Stretford, to <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a> ().

The earthwork was constructed some time between the <a href="end%20of%20Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain">end of Roman rule in Britain</a> in the early 5th century and the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a> in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, or it may have been a late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> and <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. In the <a href="early%20medieval">early medieval</a> period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> struggled for control over <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>, along with the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a> and the <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

Legend has it that Nico Ditch was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869–870; Manchester may have been <a href="looting">sacked</a> by the Danes in 870. It was said that each man had an allocated area to construct, and was required to dig his section of the ditch and build a bank equal to his own height. According to 19th century folklore, the ditch was the site of a battle between <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a> and Danes; the battle was supposed to have given the nearby towns of Gorton and Reddish their names, from "Gore Town" and "Red-Ditch", but the idea has been dismissed by historians as a "popular fancy". The names derive from "dirty farmstead" and "reedy ditch" respectively.

<a href="Antiquarian">Antiquarian</a>s and historians have been interested in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank to the north of the ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.

Despite heavy weathering, the ditch is still visible in short sections, which can be wide and up to deep. A stretch through <a href="Denton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Denton</a> Golf Course, and a section running through <a href="Platt%20Fields%20Park">Platt Fields Park</a>, are considered the best preserved remains. In 1997, a segment of the ditch in Platt Fields was protected as a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.

Maurice Wilder-Neligan

<a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Maurice Wilder-Neligan, (4 October 1882 – 10 January 1923), born Maurice Neligan, was an Australian soldier who commanded the <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n-raised <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a> during the latter stages of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a>. Raised and educated in the United Kingdom, he was briefly a soldier with the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a> in London, after which he travelled to Australia where he worked in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. He enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 20 August 1914 at Townsville, under the name Maurice Wilder, giving <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand, as his place of birth. A <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> in the <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th Battalion</a> by the time of the <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac">Gallipoli landings</a> of April 1915, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>, the second highest award for acts of gallantry by other ranks. He was quickly <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a>, reaching the rank of temporary <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> before the end of the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a>. During his time at Gallipoli he was wounded once, and formally changed his name to Wilder-Neligan.

Arriving on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with the <a href="substantive%20rank">substantive rank</a> of captain, he led a "most brilliant" raid on German trenches near <a href="Fleurbaix">Fleurbaix</a>, and although severely wounded in the head, stuck to his command until the operation was successfully completed. For his actions he was appointed a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO), the second highest award for gallantry by officers. When he returned from hospital, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a>, and was in temporary command of his battalion during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bullecourt">Second Battle of Bullecourt</a> in May 1917. In July, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed to command the 10th Battalion. He led that unit during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Menin%20Road%20Ridge">Battle of the Menin Road Ridge</a> in September and was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> in June 1918. Perhaps his greatest achievement was the capture of <a href="Merris">Merris</a> in July, for which he was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DSO, again for gallantry. He continued to skilfully lead his battalion throughout the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a> and up to the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice of 11 November</a>. During the war, in addition to decorations already mentioned, he was awarded the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a> and was <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> five times.

After the war, he worked as a <a href="district%20officer">district officer</a> in the Australian-administered <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">Territory of New Guinea</a>, where he died at the age of 40, probably of complications from his war wounds. He was buried on Garua Island, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. Considered by many to be rather eccentric, he was also a successful tactician, a skilful organiser, and highly regarded for his treatment of the soldiers under his command.

Born Maurice Neligan in <a href="Tavistock%2C%20Devon">Tavistock, Devon</a>, England, on 4 October 1882, he was a son of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">Canon</a> John West Neligan and his wife Charlotte, Putland. His elder brother, the <a href="Right%20Reverend">Right Reverend</a> <a href="Moore%20Neligan">Moore Neligan</a>, was the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Auckland">Anglican Bishop of Auckland</a>, New Zealand, from 1903 to 1910. Maurice attended <a href="Ipswich%20School">Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Ipswich</a>, and <a href="Bedford%20School">Bedford Grammar School</a>.

On 18 February 1905, he was married to a <a href="divorce">divorce</a>e, Frances Jane Wyatt, in <a href="London">London</a>. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in bankruptcy proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. He and his wife had one daughter.

He was enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a> in September 1910, having lowered his age and given <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their <a href="Park%20Lane">Park Lane</a> home in London and travelling to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Australia. In the remaining years before the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> he worked as a clerk at a <a href="Sugar%20cane%20mill">sugar mill</a> <a href="Truck%20scale">weighbridge</a> in <a href="Proserpine%2C%20Queensland">Proserpine, Queensland</a>, and also lived at Kelly's Club Hotel in <a href="Brandon%2C%20Queensland">Brandon</a>, where he formed a close connection to the publican's family.

Neligan was enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 20 August 1914 at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, under the name Maurice Wilder, again giving Auckland as his place of birth. The AIF was established as Australia's <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> to fight in the war, as the Citizens' Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). He had first attempted to enlist under his true name and age, and had told the clerk he was married with a child. When told that younger unmarried men were volunteering in great numbers, and that his services would not be required, he merely joined a queue in front of a different clerk, gave the name Wilder and claimed he was a bachelor. With the rank of <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> he was allotted to the Queensland-raised <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th Battalion</a> of the <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>, which was part of the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a>, and was given the regimental number 974. 

Within three weeks he had been promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a>, and by late September was a <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. The <a href="battalion">battalion</a> embarked for overseas the following month and sailed via <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>, to Egypt on the "Themistocles", arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, Wilder was promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>, and he was posted as the battalion <a href="orderly%20room%20sergeant">orderly room sergeant</a>.

After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the <a href="covering%20force">covering force</a> for the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April 1915, and so was the first brigade ashore about 4:30am. By 9:00am, Wilder was performing the role of battalion <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, assisting the acting <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> to organise and direct the unit. The day after the landing, Wilder's actions resulted in the award of the <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>, the second highest award for acts of <a href="courage">gallantry</a> by <a href="Other%20ranks%20%28UK%29">other ranks</a>. The citation read: 

Owing to officer casualties, he was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> three days after the landing. Along with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, the 9th Battalion was closely engaged in establishing and defending the Anzac beachhead during the ensuing months, rotating between the various posts and trenches. 

During the heavy Turkish <a href="counter-attack">counter-attack</a> of 19 May, Wilder showed "capacity to command at a difficult moment". On the night of 27 May, he commanded a raid by 63 soldiers of the battalion on a Turkish position south of the Anzac perimeter near <a href="Kabatepe">Gaba Tepe</a>. The <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> used its <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> to pinpoint the trench to be attacked, then pounded it with twenty rounds of <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosive</a> and <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">shrapnel</a> from its guns. Wilder then led his force quickly up the hill towards the Turkish position, and using only the <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>, they killed six, captured one, and returned to the Australian lines without suffering casualties. According to his biographer, <a href="Alec%20Hill">Alec Hill</a>, the success of the raid was ensured by his meticulous planning. He was wounded in early June and evacuated to Egypt, but discharged himself from hospital and returned to his unit by early August, when he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. In the same month, he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for the first time.

In mid-September he was formally appointed as unit adjutant, swiftly followed by a temporary promotion to <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>. He formally changed his name to Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period on the front line in the desert near the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to be allowed to take out a patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but no contact with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> for France and the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> at the end of the month.

Soon after his unit reached the trenches in France, he planned a major raid near <a href="Fleurbaix">Fleurbaix</a>, carefully preparing his men before launching it on the night of 1/2 July. This was a "silent" raid, being undertaken without a preparatory bombardment of the targeted German trenches. Wilder-Neligan split his 148 troops into three groups, and directed them to enter the German trenches about apart to avoid German <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfilading</a> fire. He trained his raiding party and conducted rehearsals in the days leading up to the operation. On the night of the raid, Wilder-Neligan used machine gun fire to cover the sound of his troops advancing across <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>. When they were close, he called down a protective barrage behind the German trenches, with machine guns sweeping the enemy flanks. The raiders then rushed forward, entered the enemy trenches and engaging in heavy fighting. During the final rush, Wilder-Neligan came across a German observation post in advance of the enemy trenches. He killed two of the three enemy soldiers occupying it, but the third threw a <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a> that wounded him severely in the shoulder and in the head, fracturing his skull. Despite his wounds, he continued to direct his men until they had all returned safely. During the raid, the Queenslanders killed 14 Germans, wounded 40, and captured 25 more along with a machine gun, for the loss of seven dead and 26 wounded. The Australian Official War Historian, <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, described this action as "perhaps the most brilliant raid that Australians undertook" at the time. The success of the operation was recognised by Wilder-Neligan's appointment as a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a>, the second highest award for acts of gallantry by officers. The citation read: 

Evacuated to the United Kingdom for treatment, he did not return to his unit until October, when he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a>. In November he was again mentioned in despatches for "distinguished and gallant services and devotion to duty in the field". The 9th Battalion continued to take its turn at the front line through the worst European winter in 40 years. On 24 February, Wilder-Neligan was training his troops for another raid in force, this time on the German position known as "The Maze", south of the village of Le Barque, when it was discovered that the Germans were withdrawing from the front line. Along with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, the 9th Battalion was soon advancing towards the village, striking isolated pockets of resistance. After this, the battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> of fortifications. In mid-April, parts of the 9th Battalion were in the thick of the fighting against a major German counter-attack at <a href="Lagnicourt-Marcel">Lagnicourt</a>.

Wilder-Neligan was in temporary command of his battalion during the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May 1917, part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>. For the attack on the German trenches known as O.G. 1 and O.G. 2, the 9th Battalion was placed under the command of the <a href="1st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Brigade</a>. Before the attack, he arranged for his men to create dumps of <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>, stakes, hand grenades and other equipment and tools near to the battalion assembly point for the attack. He ensured that telephone lines were laid as far forward as possible, then briefed his company commanders and supporting units. Fierce bomb fights occurred in both objective trenches as soon as the 9th Battalion attacked, but the Queenslanders gradually pushed the Germans back. A heavy German barrage then fell on the captured trenches. During the battle, the unit suffered 160 casualties, mainly from bombs. For his actions at Bullecourt, Wilder-Neligan was recommended for the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Belgian Order of the Crown</a>, although there is no record of an appointment to the order. For other brief periods in the first half of 1917 he was acting commanding officer of the 9th Battalion.

On 23 June 1917, he was temporarily placed in command of his battalion's <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n-raised sister unit of the 3rd Brigade, the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>. After briefly returning to his old unit on 6 July, he took command of the 10th Battalion with the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 15 July. This was considered a surprising promotion, as at the time he was junior to forty majors then in the AIF.

Wilder-Neligan's first fight with his new battalion was the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Menin%20Road%20Ridge">Battle of the Menin Road Ridge</a>, which commenced on 20 September as part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>. In the initial planning for this offensive, the 10th Battalion was committed to the third phase of the attack by the 3rd Brigade. For this attack, Wilder-Neligan had split his command into two. The assault would be carried out by two specially trained "storm" companies, with his other two companies responsible for carrying forward ammunition and equipment and "mopping-up" pockets of resistance. During the move to the start line, the two carrying and "mopping-up" companies of the battalion were caught in a heavy and persistent German barrage, suffered significant casualties and became disorganised. Wilder-Neligan sent back his adjutant to re-organise them, and they came through the German shell fire to their assembly positions. 

Although initially intended as the third wave of the brigade attack, the second wave <a href="12th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">12th Battalion</a> had moved to the left as a result of the German barrage, and the 10th effectively joined the second wave on its right. The 10th had also moved forward to avoid the heavy barrage, and had become intermingled with the first wave formed by the <a href="11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">11th Battalion</a>. When a machine gun in a <a href="pillbox%20%28military%29">pillbox</a> held up the leading troops, Wilder-Neligan sent one of his "storm" platoons to outflank the German position. When the platoon commander was killed, the South Australians "went mad" according to Wilder-Neligan, killing rather than capturing most of the German garrison. When the first objective was reached, Wilder-Neligan had his battalion fill the gap in the line to the right of the 12th Battalion. As soon as the two carrying and "mopping-up" companies reached the second objective, Wilder-Neligan left them there to dig in. During a pause in the battle while his two "storm" companies were waiting to go forward to the third objective, Wilder-Neligan had specially procured copies of the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" and "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" newspapers distributed for his men to read. With the help of the heavy creeping barrage, the third objective was quickly taken. During the battle, the unit suffered 207 casualties. On the day following the battle, he was billed by a London newspaper as "The Eccentric Colonel", due to his distribution of newspapers to his waiting troops.

Wilder-Neligan was on leave from 25 September to 8 October. The day after he returned, the battalion conducted a raid in force of German positions in Celtic Wood near <a href="Passendale">Passchendaele</a>, part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poelcappelle">Battle of Poelcappelle</a>. The operation was a disaster, largely due to the poor artillery support provided. Of the 85 troops involved, most were killed or wounded. Wilder-Neligan was mentioned in despatches for the third time in November. The recommendation cited his "clever organisation, untiring energy, zeal and exemplary bravery" between February and September 1917, and highlighted his leadership at Bullecourt. The 10th Battalion rotated through front line, reserve and rest areas throughout the winter of 1917/1918. 

Wilder-Neligan sprained his ankle on 11 January, and was away from his unit for a week. He was away for another week in late January. On 11 February he went on leave, but did not return until 20 May, as he was temporarily commanding his old battalion from 30 March until that date. Wilder-Neligan was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time on 7 April. While he was commanding the 9th Battalion, it participated in the 3rd Brigade's abortive attempt to capture <a href="M%C3%A9teren">Méteren</a> on 24 April. On 30 May, the 10th Battalion conducted a successful operation to capture several German posts forward of the line near <a href="Merris">Merris</a>, suffering 64 casualties. After achieving its objectives, the battalion fought off two German counter-attacks. An innovation employed by Wilder-Neligan during this operation was a battery of <a href="rifle%20grenade">rifle grenadiers</a> formed from cooks and other headquarters staff, who provided close support to the assaulting troops. The battalion was congratulated by the army corps, division and brigade commanders for its work.

In June, Wilder-Neligan was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> for his work as commanding officer of the 10th Battalion from September 1917 to February 1918. On 28 June, he was sick with <a href="influenza">influenza</a> but still on duty when an opportunity for "<a href="peaceful%20penetration">peaceful penetration</a>" of the German trenches arose. Directed to conduct a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a> in front of Merris, where the 10th Battalion held the front line, Wilder-Neligan took advantage of the accompanying barrage to encourage his two line companies to capture advanced German posts. He reinforced their initial success by ordering that both companies continue their advance, and simultaneously brought up most of his support and reserve companies to assist. The advance was covered by a smoke barrage laid down by <a href="Stokes%20mortar">trench mortars</a> and rifle grenades. Wilder-Neligan's close coordination of an artillery barrage behind the German posts helped the battalion push even further forward. By the end of the day, the 10th Battalion had captured of German line, along with 35 prisoners, six machine guns and two trench mortars, for the loss of about 50 casualties. His job done, Wilder-Neligan then reported sick. This time, the battalion received congratulations from the army and army corps commanders.

Wilder-Neligan returned to duty on 7 July. On 22–23 July, the 10th Battalion was back in the line opposite Merris. Characteristically, on his own initiative, Wilder-Neligan pushed strong patrols forward on his flanks in an effort to envelop the village. He had achieved some success, and believed that the capture of the village was imminent when a heavy German barrage descended on the battalion outpost line. The new divisional commander, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="William%20Glasgow%20%28general%29">William Glasgow</a>, now became aware of Wilder-Neligan's operation, and, as Wilder-Neligan could not guarantee communication with his flanking patrols due to the barrage, Glasgow ordered the 10th Battalion to withdraw. In his report on the operation, Wilder-Neligan noted that between 60 and 70 Germans had been killed and four prisoners taken, for the loss of two killed and seven wounded. Regarding this operation, he reported that, "the ultimate withdrawal in obedience to the order of the Divisional Commander in no way mitigated its success".

A week later, he was given the opportunity to prove the wisdom of his plan to capture Merris. On the night of 29 July, under cover of a precisely planned creeping barrage that worked its way through Merris and beyond it, he sent two companies, totalling about 180 men, on converging lines of attack from the northeast and southwest of the village. After an hour of carefully coordinated artillery, machine gun and trench mortar support, he sent his headquarters platoon into the shattered village to "mop-up" any remaining resistance. At its conclusion, the operation had captured the village, surrounding it with a series of strongly held posts, and had captured 188 Germans for the loss of 35 casualties, only four of whom were killed. Hill states that the capture of Merris was "perhaps [Wilder-Neligan's] greatest achievement". 

The inspector general of training for the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> described the capture of Merris as "the best show ever done by a battalion in France". Wilder-Neligan was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his Distinguished Service Order for this "innovative and daring operation". The citation read: 

In August, Wilder-Neligan led his battalion during the early fighting of the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, which began on 8 August 1918 with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a>. During the fighting for <a href="Lihons">Lihons</a> on 10 August, he brought his battalion up into close support using an unconventional method. He moved forward of his unit, carrying a <a href="Signal%20lamp">signalling lamp</a> on his back, using it to transmit orders to his unit to halt or advance. By this method he brought his battalion into a position from which it could support his old unit, the 9th, with only one casualty. From his advanced position, he could see that the flank of the 9th had been held up, and he sent his strongest company to assist in the capture of Crépey Wood.

On the following day, 9 August, Wilder-Neligan was placed in command of a force consisting of his own battalion and the 12th Battalion for the capture of Lihons itself. Despite heavy mist, he showed his clear grasp of the tactical situation when he realised that German counter-attacks were taking advantage of a gap between the forward troops, and quickly cleared it using supporting troops. During 10–14 August, the 10th Battalion suffered 123 casualties.

The 10th Battalion was back in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance continued north of <a href="Proyart">Proyart</a>. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Wilder-Neligan visited the neighbouring battalion, and upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in a wood, immediately deployed two companies to clear the area, and due to his initiative the advance was able to continue. The 10th Battalion continued in the advance towards the Hindenburg outpost line over the next few days before being relieved for a short period of training and rest. On 18 September, the battalion saw its last fighting of the war during the capture of the Hindenburg outpost line south of the village of <a href="Villeret%2C%20Aisne">Villeret</a>. In heavy fighting, the unit captured the second and third objectives, and were then relieved and went into a period of training and rest. By this point, the battalion had been reduced to a strength of 517 men. On 10 October, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a>. He was mentioned in despatches for the fifth and final time on 8 November. After the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice of 11 November</a>, Wilder-Neligan remained with his battalion until 1 January 1919. He returned to Australia in July, arriving in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in September. For his service during the war, in addition to the decorations already mentioned, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Star">1914–15 Star</a>, <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a> and <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a>.

Wilder-Neligan's clear tactical acumen was accompanied by relentless striving to ensure the needs of his men were met. According to Hill, "above all he was an organiser, some said the best in the AIF". Bean noted that he was "a restless and adventurous spirit", "an impetuous, daredevil officer, but free of the carelessness with which those qualities are often associated", "a gay, wild young Englishman, clever soldier, and inevitably a leader wherever he was", and a "mercurial commander".

He had many eccentric habits, and often embarrassed his officers through his actions. He would supervise <a href="Military%20parade">battalion drill</a> from horseback, armed with a megaphone, with which he would berate the officers incessantly, causing much confusion. On one occasion he even chased the officers off the parade square to show his displeasure with their efforts. He was known by the nicknames "Mad Wilder", "Wily Wilder", and "Mad Neligan". Nevertheless, he was admired and trusted by his men. He was the most highly decorated officer to command the 10th Battalion during the war.

In accordance with normal repatriation procedures, Wilder-Neligan's commission in the AIF was terminated following his return to Australia in October 1919. He was involved in the formation of a soldiers' political party in Queensland, travelling the country and delivering speeches from the back of a truck. On 1 January 1920 he was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the part-time army, the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizens' Forces</a>. In late March the following year he transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force</a>, which was then occupying <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a>. This appointment was at the rank of lieutenant. He did not immediately travel to New Guinea, living on the north coast of Queensland for two months, and visiting Brisbane in early May to receive his French Croix de guerre from the former AIF commander <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="William%20Birdwood">Sir William Birdwood</a> during the latter's first visit to Australia. Wilder-Neligan travelled to New Guinea later that year to take up his appointment.

Wilder-Neligan's initial role was as a deputy <a href="district%20officer">district officer</a> for the garrison of <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on the island of <a href="New%20Britain">Neupommern</a> (later renamed New Britain). In May 1921, when the military administration of the former German colony was handed over to an Australian civil one mandated by the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, he was transferred to the administration of the newly created <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">Territory of New Guinea</a> as district officer for <a href="Talasea%20District">Talasea</a> in west New Britain. Early in January 1923, the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20administrators%20of%20New%20Guinea">Administrator</a>, <a href="Evan%20Wisdom">Evan Wisdom</a>, summoned him to Rabaul to answer allegations of financial malpractice that had been made against him by a former German planter. It appears that he resigned and sailed for Rabaul. Going ashore to rest for a few days at the village of Ekerapi before continuing his journey, he died during the night of 9/10 January. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died <a href="Intestacy">intestate</a> and with debts.

A coronial inquiry was conducted by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the <a href="West%20Terrace%20Cemetery%23AIF%20Cemetery">AIF Cemetery</a>, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published on the front page of the Adelaide newspaper, <a href="The%20Mail%20%28Adelaide%29">"The Mail"</a>, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.

The Orb

The Orb are an English <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> group founded in 1988 by <a href="Alex%20Paterson">Alex Paterson</a> and <a href="The%20KLF">The KLF</a> member <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a>. Beginning as <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> and <a href="dub%20music">dub</a> <a href="disc%20jockey">DJs</a> in London, their early performances were inspired by electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>. Because of their <a href="Psychedelic%20experience">psychedelic</a> sound, the Orb developed a cult following among <a href="nightclub">clubbers</a> "coming down" from drug-induced highs. The Orb have maintained their drug-related <a href="List%20of%20science%20fiction%20themes">science fiction themes</a> despite personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members <a href="Kris%20Weston">Kris Weston</a>, Andy Falconer, <a href="Simon%20Phillips%20%28producer%29">Simon Phillips</a>, Nick Burton, and <a href="Andy%20Hughes">Andy Hughes</a>. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer <a href="Thomas%20Fehlmann">Thomas Fehlmann</a> and, later, with <a href="Martin%20%26quot%3BYouth%26quot%3B%20Glover">Martin "Youth" Glover</a>, bassist of Killing Joke. Beyond recognition on their albums and concerts, his unauthorised use of other artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with <a href="Rickie%20Lee%20Jones">Rickie Lee Jones</a>.

During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>.

They released their fifteenth studio album, "<a href="No%20Sounds%20Are%20Out%20of%20Bounds">No Sounds Are Out of Bounds</a>", on 22 June 2018 via <a href="Cooking%20Vinyl">Cooking Vinyl</a>.

<a href="Alex%20Paterson">Alex Paterson</a> began his music career in the early 1980s as a <a href="roadie">roadie</a> for the <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> rock band <a href="Killing%20Joke">Killing Joke</a>, for whom his childhood friend <a href="Martin%20Glover">Martin "Youth" Glover</a> played bass. After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future <a href="The%20KLF">KLF</a> member <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a> and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name "The Orb". Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine", released on the German record compilation "<a href="Eternity%20Project%20One">Eternity Project One</a>". The following year, the Orb released the "<a href="Kiss%20%28The%20Orb%20EP%29">Kiss EP</a>", a four-track <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> based on samples from New York City's <a href="WRKS">KISS FM</a>. It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label <a href="WAU%21%20Mr.%20Modo%20Records">WAU! Mr. Modo Records</a>, which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the <a href="Chill%20out%20music">chill out</a> room at London nightclub <a href="Heaven%20%28nightclub%29">Heaven</a>. Resident DJ <a href="Paul%20Oakenfold">Paul Oakenfold</a> brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his "The Land of Oz" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack recording</a>s linked to multiple <a href="record%20deck">record deck</a>s and a <a href="mixing%20console">mixer</a>. The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and <a href="BBC%20Radiophonic%20Workshop">BBC sound effects</a> into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as "<a href="Sue%C3%B1o%20Latino">Sueño Latino</a>". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played <a href="Dub%20music">dub</a> and other <a href="chill-out%20music">chill-out music</a>, which it described as ambient house for the E generation.

Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Martin Glover, developed a <a href="music%20production">music production</a> style that incorporated <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> with a diverse array of <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music <a href="ambient%20house">ambient house</a>. The culmination of the group's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>. The track, then known as "Loving You," was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> radio plays, nature sounds, and <a href="Minnie%20Riperton">Minnie Riperton</a>'s "<a href="Lovin%27%20You%20%28Minnie%20Riperton%20song%29">Lovin' You</a>". For its release as a single on the record label <a href="Big%20Life">Big Life</a>, the Orb changed the title to "<a href="A%20Huge%20Ever%20Growing%20Pulsating%20Brain%20That%20Rules%20from%20the%20Centre%20of%20the%20Ultraworld">A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld</a>". Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the <a href="UK%20singles%20chart">British singles charts</a>. Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by <a href="David%20A.%20Stewart">Dave Stewart</a> to remix his top-20 single "<a href="Lily%20Was%20Here">Lily Was Here</a>". The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including <a href="Erasure">Erasure</a> and <a href="System%207%20%28band%29">System 7</a>.

In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty's studio, <a href="Trancentral">Trancentral</a>. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release their music through his <a href="KLF%20Communications">KLF Communications</a> label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure that the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as "<a href="Space%20%28Jimmy%20Cauty%20album%29">Space</a>" on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came <a href="the%20KLF">the KLF</a> album "<a href="Chill%20Out">Chill Out</a>", on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.

Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track "<a href="Little%20Fluffy%20Clouds">Little Fluffy Clouds</a>". The group incorporated samples from <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a>'s "<a href="Electric%20Counterpoint">Electric Counterpoint</a>". The signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter Rickie Lee Jones, her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional CD released by Geffen records for her 1989 Flying Cowboys CD. In it she muses on the picturesque images of clouds from her Arizona childhood.

In 1991, Paterson invited freelance studio engineer Andy Falconer to join the Orb. He was closely followed by studio engineer <a href="Kris%20Weston">Kris "Thrash" Weston</a>. <a href="Steve%20Hillage">Steve Hillage</a>, who Paterson had met while DJ-ing in London, also joined as a guitarist. Along with producer <a href="Thomas%20Fehlmann">Thomas Fehlmann</a>, the Orb completed several additional tracks for their first album, "<a href="The%20Orb%27s%20Adventures%20Beyond%20The%20Ultraworld">The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld</a>". At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during the three weeks of recording. Falconer's and Weston's technical abilities and Hillage's guitar work allowed the group to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, including the launch of "<a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>". "Adventures" sold well in the United Kingdom and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling. Retrospectively, "Adventures" is considered ground-breaking for changing the way musicians view sampling and as a vital work for the genres of ambient and dance music. The completion of "Adventures" saw the departure of Andy Falconer, whose last contribution was to one of the Orb's Peel Sessions. To promote the release of an edited single-disc version for an American release on <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a>, the Orb embarked on their first tour of the United States beginning in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, in October 1991.

In late 1991 and early 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, "<a href="Blue%20Room%20%28single%29">Blue Room</a>". Assisting with the recording was bassist <a href="Jah%20Wobble">Jah Wobble</a>, keyboardist <a href="Miquette%20Giraudy">Miquette Giraudy</a>, and guitarist Hillage. Despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes, "Blue Room" entered the British charts at #12 and peaked at #8, making it the longest track to reach the charts. The Orb promoted this single with a "legendary avant-garde" performance on "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" where Patterson and Weston played a game of <a href="chess">chess</a> in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of "Blue Room" ran in the background. In July 1992, "<a href="U.F.Orb">U.F.Orb</a>" was released featuring "Blue Room" and, in the US release, the Orb's next single, "<a href="Assassin%20%28The%20Orb%20song%29">Assassin</a>". Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's <a href="Brian%20Eno">Eno</a>-influenced ambience on "U.F.Orb", combining "drum and bass rhythms" with "velvet keyboards" and "rippling synth lines". "U.F.Orb" reached #1 on the British album charts to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>. Despite the Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music to be the focus of attention. Because of this partial anonymity and the Orb's rotating membership, they are often recognised as more of a musical collective than a "band".

Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce "new" material. This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and the Orb soon left the label to sign a deal with <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>. Their first release on Island Records was the live album "<a href="Live%2093">Live 93</a>", which gathered highlights from their recent performances in Europe and Asia. It featured the live crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and <a href="Simon%20Phillips%20%28producer%29">Simon Phillips</a>, as well as audio engineer <a href="Andy%20Hughes">Andy Hughes</a>, who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring. The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was "<a href="Pomme%20Fritz">Pomme Fritz</a>", a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies. Though "Pomme Fritz" reached #6 on the British charts, critics panned it as "doodling". Island Records "hated it" and "didn't understand it at all", according to Paterson. Soon after production finished on "Pomme Fritz", Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a> to form the group <a href="FFWD">FFWD</a> as a side project. FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's <a href="Inter-Modo">Inter-Modo</a> label, which Fehlmann later described as "an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!". Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release. Soon after the release of "FFWD" in August 1994, Weston suddenly left the Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to his desire to have more control in the Orb. In an interview with "<a href="i-D">i-D</a>", Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson "didn't do his 50 per cent of the work". Paterson reaffirmed the status of the Orb saying, "The Orb is the Orb, and nothing can change that", and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.

Following Weston's departure from the Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, but did not always participate in live performances. Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album "<a href="Orbus%20Terrarum">Orbus Terrarum</a>", on which Paterson and Weston had been working. "Orbus Terrarum", released in 1995, featured more "earthbound" and "organic" sounds than their previous trippy science-fiction-themed music. "Orbus Terrarum" suffered, as Paterson described it, "a good kicking" at the hands of the British press, who described it as "generic" and a low point for Paterson's creativity. "Orbus Terrarum" alienated many of the group's fans, and only reached #20 on the British charts. American critics gave it great acclaim, including "Rolling Stone" who made it their album of the month, citing its symphonic flow coupled with the Orb's "uniquely British wit". After a long world tour, the Orb, with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, settled down to produce their next album, "<a href="Orblivion">Orblivion</a>"—the process of which saw a return to their spacey sounds. Though "Orblivion" was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow up to <a href="U2">U2</a>'s techno-rock album "<a href="Pop%20%28U2%20album%29">Pop</a>". "Orblivion" sold well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the <a href="Billboard%20Top%20200">Billboard Top 200</a>. The first "Orblivion" single, "<a href="Toxygene">Toxygene</a>", was the highest charting single by the Orb, reaching #4 in the United Kingdom on 8 February 1997. Despite high sales, "Orblivion" received a lukewarm reception from the British press. As with "Orbus Terrarum", "Orblivion" was better received by American critics, including "Rolling Stone", who praised its "contrast of chaos and euphony". Meanwhile, the stresses of touring sat heavily on Paterson; he considered retiring the Orb, but continued touring and producing. In 1997 the band sold their studio "Joe's Garage" to the Godfrey brothers of <a href="Morcheeba">Morcheeba</a>.

Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Nick Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced "<a href="Cydonia%20%28album%29">Cydonia</a>" for a planned 1999 release. Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, <a href="John%20Roome">John Roome</a> (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of the Orb's live performers. Singers Nina Walsh and Aki Omori appeared on two tracks each, providing vocals and co-writing lyrics with Paterson. Paterson felt that this new direction of songwriting for the Orb was more similar to the experimental work of "Orbus Terrarum" than to the techno-pop of "Orblivion". Island Records was in a period of restructuring due to its recent purchase by <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a>, and "Cydonia" was not released until 2001. Upon release, critics noted that "Cydonia" merged pop, trance, and ambient-dub music, which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked the appeal of the Orb's earlier work. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" harshly described it as "a stillborn relic, flawed throughout by chronically stunted ambitions" and describing its only appropriate audience to be "old ravers" seeking nostalgia. The Orb were generally regarded by the British press as past their prime and an "ambient dinosaur" out of place in the current dance music environment. After the release of "Cydonia", Hughes left the group for undisclosed reasons, becoming "another acrimonious departure from the Orb" according to "The Guardian".

In 2001, Alex Paterson formed the record label <a href="Badorb.com">Badorb.com</a> as an outlet for Orb members' side projects. To promote both Badorb.com and "Cydonia", the Orb toured internationally, including their first visit to the United States in four years. "NME" described the Orb's tour as "charming" and that they were "freed from the <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Floydian</a> pretensions that dogged the band throughout the mid-'90s".

The Orb, now composed of Paterson, Phillips, and Fehlmann, with guest John Roome, accepted an invitation to join the concert tour with <a href="Moby">Moby</a>, <a href="Paul%20Oakenfold">Paul Oakenfold</a>, <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a> and other alternative and electronic artists. Though the Orb were paired with more mainstream artists during the tour such as <a href="Incubus%20%28band%29">Incubus</a>, Paterson and Fehlmann made their next releases a series of several low-key EPs for German label <a href="Kompakt">Kompakt</a> in 2002. The Orb found critical success on Kompakt; but Badorb.com collapsed soon after releasing the compilation "Bless You". Badorb.com had released fourteen records over the course of fourteen months from artists including <a href="Guy%20Pratt">Guy Pratt</a> (Conduit), <a href="Ayumi%20Hamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>, and <a href="Takayuki%20Shiraishi">Takayuki Shiraishi</a>, as well as the Orb's three-track "<a href="Daleth%20of%20Elphame%20EP">Daleth of Elphame EP</a>". Though Badorb.com was an internet-based record label, they only sold vinyl releases (with one exception, the Orb EP), which Paterson later remarked was a poor idea because "not many people... have record players".

Though their musical style had changed somewhat since the 1990s, the Orb continued to use their odd synthetic sounds on 2004's "<a href="Bicycles%20%26amp%3B%20Tricycles">Bicycles & Tricycles</a>", to mixed reviews. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" praised "Bicycles & Tricycles" as being "inclusive, exploratory, and an enjoyable journey"; other publications dismissed it as "stoner dub" and irrelevant to current electronic music. Like "Cydonia", "Bicycles & Tricycles" featured vocals, including rapper MC Soom-T who added a hip hop contribution to the album. The Orb left Island Records and released the album on <a href="Cooking%20Vinyl">Cooking Vinyl</a> and <a href="Sanctuary%20Records">Sanctuary Records</a>. To promote the album, the band began a UK tour with dub artist <a href="Mad%20Professor">Mad Professor</a>. Though the Orb still pulled in large crowds, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" noted that they lacked the intensity found in their earlier performances.

After two more EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now composed of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released "<a href="Okie%20Dokie%20It%27s%20The%20Orb%20on%20Kompakt">Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt</a>", which featured new material in addition to tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, "<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>" observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, "inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses". Because of this, "Okie Dokie" was considerably more focused and less "goofy" than "Cydonia" and "Bicycles & Tricycles". Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic <a href="music%20loop">loops</a> and <a href="delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delays</a> made him the centre of "Okie Dokie" production and, according to "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>", made it "difficult to say where [Paterson] is in the picture". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could "age gracefully".

In August 2006, the founders of the Orb - Paterson and Cauty - released "<a href="Living%20in%20a%20Giant%20Candle%20Winking%20at%20God">Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God</a>", their debut album as the <a href="Transit%20Kings">Transit Kings</a> with <a href="Guy%20Pratt">Guy Pratt</a> and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from <a href="The%20Smiths">Smiths'</a> guitarist <a href="Johnny%20Marr">Johnny Marr</a> and comedian <a href="Simon%20Day">Simon Day</a>. Beken described "Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God" as "self-consciously musically written and less sample-based" compared to the members' previous work. "Living" had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions, with reviewers such as "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" comparing the album favourably to the music of <a href="DJ%20Shadow">DJ Shadow</a> and <a href="R%C3%B6yksopp">Röyksopp</a> while other publications, such as "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", called it "Orb-lite" and proclaimed it to be "<a href="Deep%20Forest">Deep Forest</a>-style sludge". Soon after the album's release, Cauty left the Transit Kings on "extended leave", leaving the project in indefinite limbo. Paterson and Beken reunited in 2008 as High Frequency Bandwidth, an ambient hip hop group on the <a href="Malicious%20Damage">Malicious Damage</a> label.

The Orb's next studio album, "<a href="The%20Dream%20%28The%20Orb%20album%29">The Dream</a>", was released in Japan in 2007 and the following year in the United States and United Kingdom. Fehlmann is absent on "The Dream" and Paterson was instead reunited with Martin Glover and joined by Tim Bran of <a href="Dreadzone">Dreadzone</a>. The album saw a return to the Orb's sounds of the early 1990s, with peculiar vocals and playful samples. The Orb also brought in jazz and house music singer <a href="Juliet%20Roberts">Juliet Roberts</a> and guitarist <a href="Steve%20Hillage">Steve Hillage</a>.

After July 2006 re-release of "The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld" 3-CD Deluxe Edition, 2007 and 2008 saw releases of expanded 2-CD editions of the band's subsequent regular studio records: "U.F.Orb", "Pomme Fritz" EP, "Orbus Terrarum", "Orblivion" and "Cydonia". In late 2008 a double-cd compilation of <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> <a href="List%20of%20Peel%20sessions">sessions</a> called "The Orb: Complete BBC Sessions 1989-2001" was released.

In May 2009, the British Malicious Damage Records (run by the members of <a href="Killing%20Joke">Killing Joke</a>) announced the release of the Orb's ninth regular studio album "<a href="Baghdad%20Batteries%20%28Orbsessions%20Volume%20III%29">Baghdad Batteries (Orbsessions Volume III)</a>" on 11 September 2009. A reunification of Paterson and long-term collaborator Thomas Fehlmann who last worked together on "Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt", the album was promoted with a launch party with Paterson and Fehlmann performing the whole album live at The-Situation Modern in <a href="Clapham">Clapham</a>, England on 10 September. A track "Chocolate Fingers" was uploaded onto the label's <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a> profile. The 11-track album is said to be the third in the "Orbsessions" series, although unlike the first two outtakes parts composed of brand new material, recorded at Fehlmann's Berlin studio.

In March 2010 Internet station <a href="Dandelion%20Radio">Dandelion Radio</a> broadcast a seventeen and a half minute long Orb session track by Patterson and Fehlmann on the Andrew Morrison show. This new track was titled "Battersea Bunches" and was a remixed version of the soundtrack to a short movie of the same title by Mike Coles and Alex Patterson - a film installation to be seen at London's Battersea Power Station on 1 June 2010 as part of an evening of art and music. The film and its soundtrack (together with remixes) were later released as the CD/DVD album "<a href="C%20Batter%20C">C Batter C</a>" on 11 November 2011.

In mid-2010 <a href="Alex%20Paterson">Alex Paterson</a> teamed up with Youth aka <a href="Martin%20Glover">Martin Glover</a> to compile a retrospective compilation album of tracks from the WAU! Mr Modo label. The album titled "Impossible Oddities" is set to be released on CD and double Vinyl on 25 October 2010 via Year Zero records.

The Orb released the "<a href="Metallic%20Spheres">Metallic Spheres</a>" album in October 2010, featuring <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> of <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. It was released by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>.

In 2011 Alex Paterson teamed up with electronic producer <a href="Gaudi%20%28musician%29">Gaudi</a> and vocalist Chester for the creation of their experimental and ongoing collaborative project SCREEN, releasing the album "We are Screen" by Malicious Damage Records.

In 2012 the Orb worked with dub musician <a href="Lee%20%26quot%3BScratch%26quot%3B%20Perry">Lee "Scratch" Perry</a> to produce a reggae-infused album titled "The Orbserver In The Star House", which was recorded in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> over a period of several months and features the single "Golden Clouds". The title song was based on an earlier version of <a href="Little%20Fluffy%20Clouds">Little Fluffy Clouds</a>, with the lyrics rewritten by Perry reflecting his childhood in Jamaica and the property <a href="Golden%20Clouds">Golden Clouds</a> near his home.

In 2013 the Orb performed with the Kakatsisi drummers of Ghana on the West Holts stage at <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a>.

On 22 June 2018, The Orb release their fifteenth studio album "<a href="No%20Sounds%20Are%20Out%20of%20Bounds">No Sounds Are Out of Bounds</a>".

The Orb's members have drawn from an assortment of influences in their music. The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences that included <a href="King%20Tubby">King Tubby</a>, <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>, <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>, and <a href="T.Rex%20%28band%29">T.Rex</a>. Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built. While in <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a> with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as <a href="The%20Mighty%20Diamonds">The Mighty Diamonds</a>, <a href="The%20Abyssinians">The Abyssinians</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>. The reggae influence on Paterson and the Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single "Perpetual Dawn" and "U.F.Orb"'s "Towers of Dub". The earliest ambient influences of the Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke. While with the band in <a href="Neuss">Neuss</a>, Paterson listened to Brian Eno's "<a href="Music%20for%20Films">Music for Films</a>" while on <a href="LSD">LSD</a> and watched "the <a href="Ruhr%20Area">Ruhr</a> steel works explode in the distance", noting that "[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well". The same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to <a href="Cluster%20%28band%29">Cluster</a>'s "<a href="Grosses%20Wasser">Grosses Wasser</a>" and found that the steel works' "huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music", which was something he'd "never seen, or heard, anything like it before". Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from <a href="Can%20%28band%29">Can</a> and composer <a href="Karlheinz%20Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>. "<a href="Modulations%20A%20History%20of%20Electronic%20Music">Modulations</a>" calls Paterson's music a "maximal" version of Brian Eno's "minimal" ambience, though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.

The Orb have often been described as "The Pink Floyd of the Nineties", but Paterson has stated that their music is more influenced by experimental electronic music than progressive rock of the 1970s. He has noted though that the Pink Floyd album "<a href="Meddle">Meddle</a>" was influential to him as a child in the 1970s. The psychedelic prog-rock similarities have led critics to describe the Orb as <a href="hippie">hippie</a> revivalists; Paterson has strongly rejected the tag, claiming that even as a youth, he was "one of those punks who hated hippies".

During production of "Cydonia" and "Bicycles & Tricycles", Paterson's biggest influences were <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a> and <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> music, as seen on the tracks "Ghostdancing", "Thursday's Keeper", and "Aftermath". The Orb's more recent influences consist largely of German techno producers, such as <a href="Triola%20%28producer%29">Triola</a>, who were inspired by the Orb's earlier work. Paterson cites the music of Kompakt as one of his primary modern influences and claims it to be among the best modern ambient music.

Imagery has always been an important part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites <a href="Godfrey%20Reggio">Godfrey Reggio</a>'s and <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>'s film <a href="Koyaanisqatsi">Koyaanisqatsi</a> as a primary influence to their concert imagery.

The Orb's album art features much of the same imagery as their live act. Graphic design group <a href="The%20Designers%20Republic">The Designers Republic</a> created the cover art for the earlier work, including "Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld", "U.F.Orb", and the singles from those two albums. For their next album, the Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of "Live 93" featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the <a href="Battersea%20Power%20Station">Battersea Power Station</a>, which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's "<a href="Animals%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Animals</a>". The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to the Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing. Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of "Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt".

Some of the more prominent motifs in the Orb's work are outer space and science fiction, including alien visitations, <a href="space%20flight">space flight</a>, and <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a>. These have included the use of samples from serious sources such as <a href="NASA">NASA</a> transmissions to comedic clips from films like <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s "<a href="Sleeper%20%281973%20film%29">Sleeper</a>". "U.F.Orb" especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself. The title of its most popular single, "Blue Room", is a reference to the supposed Blue Room of <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>, which was investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room. Their 2001 album is named after the <a href="Cydonia%20Mensae">Cydonia Mensae</a> region of Mars. Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, "The Guardian" described Paterson as "pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens".

In the Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an <a href="Akai">Akai</a> 12-track <a href="mixing%20console">mixer</a>. They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an "endless sound continuum" for audiences of worn out dancers. Even after the Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for "Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld" and "U.F.Orb", they performed using a <a href="digital%20audio%20tape">digital audio tape</a> machine and experimented with other media sources such as <a href="dubplate">dubplate</a>s. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing. Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect <a href="amp%20rack">racks</a>. Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.

The Orb began performing regularly at the <a href="Brixton%20Academy">Brixton Academy</a> in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their "well-suited amorphous sound", frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there. Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for the Orb's concert at the rainy <a href="Woodstock%20%2794">Woodstock '94</a>. The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including <a href="Aphex%20Twin">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href="Orbital%20%28band%29">Orbital</a>, and <a href="Deee-Lite">Deee-Lite</a>. The next year, the Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on drums, and Simon Phillips on bass. This live setup created a "cacophony" of "gigantic, swarming sounds". Though the Orb's performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present them as "a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage".

The Orb used <a href="ADAT">ADAT</a> recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as being a "studio onstage". They hooked synthesisers, such as the <a href="ARP%202600">ARP 2600</a>, to <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums. The Orb's methods of studio music creation changed as well. For more recent albums such as "Cydonia", they used inexpensive equipment such as <a href="Korg">Korg</a>'s <a href="Electribe">Electribe</a> products, which Paterson described as employing more of a "bedroom techno" approach. Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.

One of the Orb's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing. Albums such as "Pomme Fritz", though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single "Toxygene". "Toxygene" was originally commissioned as a remix of <a href="Jean%20Michel%20Jarre">Jean Michel Jarre</a>'s "Oxygene 8" from "<a href="Oxygene%207-13">Oxygene 7-13</a>". The Orb "obliterated it" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it; The Orb released the track themselves under the name "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted "The French are always five years behind us, anyway." In statements made after the release of "Toxygene", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.

Other artists have become agitated due to the Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that "[t]hey don't know the half of it." Paterson says that he finds a "beauty" and a "cleverness" with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it. Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of the samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would "die" if they discovered, for example, where the drums on "Little Fluffy Clouds" originated from. He has said that record labels have cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!".

The Orb have used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from <a href="McCarthy%20era">McCarthy era</a> speeches to prank phone calls by <a href="Victor%20Lewis-Smith">Victor Lewis-Smith</a> to <a href="David%20Thewlis">David Thewlis</a>' apocalypse-driven rant from the film "<a href="Naked%20%281993%20film%29">Naked</a>". Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favourite clips. He and other members of the Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, especially "FFWD" and "Orbus Terrarum". The Orb's combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a "fuzzy texture" in the sound quality, depersonalising the Orb's music. The Orb are lauded for their "Monty Python-esque levity" in their use of audio samples, though "NME" asserts that Paterson "sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes" with "irritatingly zany" sounds.

The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989. Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, the Orb found steady work remixing for artists including <a href="Depeche%20Mode">Depeche Mode</a>, <a href="Lisa%20Stansfield">Lisa Stansfield</a>, and <a href="Front%20242">Front 242</a>. The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature a large number of comical samples, "<a href="Progressive-Sounds">Progressive-Sounds</a>" describe them as "ahead of their time" and "NME" notes them as "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling". Some pieces, such as their <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a> cover collaboration with <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>, received criticism for being "beyond a joke" for their use of strange noises. The Orb's remix of <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>' "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Drug">The Perfect Drug</a>", too, was described as "silly", as they made it sound like <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> was "drowning in his bathtub". Though Paterson maintains that much of the Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that they could "pay the bills".

<a href="John%20Hart%20%28classicist%29">John Hart</a> and nine others were teachers at <a href="Malvern%20College">Malvern College</a> who benefited from a "concessionary fee" scheme that allowed their children to be educated at the college for one fifth of the normal fees of a pupil. The <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a> attempted to tax this benefit based on the <a href="Finance%20Act%201976">Finance Act 1976</a>. There was a dispute over the correct interpretation of the Act. The Special Commissioners charged with assessing the tax found in favour of Hart, but both the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">High Court of Justice</a> and <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a> of <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> found in favour of the Inland Revenue. The case then went to the House of Lords, which, making use of statements in Parliament as recorded in "<a href="Hansard">Hansard</a>", found in favour of Hart. <a href="James%20Mackay%2C%20Baron%20Mackay%20of%20Clashfern">Lord Mackay</a>, dissenting, argued that "Hansard" should not be considered admissible evidence because of the time and expense involved in a lawyer having to look up every debate and discussion on a particular statute when giving legal advice or preparing a case.

The decision met with a mixed reception. While judges cautiously accepted the judgment, some legal academics argued that it violated rules of evidence, damaged the <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a> between the <a href="HM%20Government">executive</a> and Parliament and caused additional expense in cases. The decision was subjected to an assault by <a href="Lord%20Steyn">Lord Steyn</a> in his Hart Lecture, delivered on 16 May 2000 and titled ""Pepper v Hart": A Re-examination", in which he disputed exactly what the House of Lords had meant by their decision and also attacked the logic and legal theory behind it. Since Lord Steyn's lecture, several judicial decisions have limited the use of "Pepper" by the courts; the result of these changes, according to <a href="Stefan%20Vogenauer">Stefan Vogenauer</a>, is that "the scope of "Pepper v Hart" has been reduced to such an extent that the ruling has almost become meaningless".

Hart and nine others were teachers at <a href="Malvern%20College">Malvern College</a>, where from 1983 to 1986 they took advantage of a "concessionary fee" scheme, which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils. They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 <a href="Finance%20Act">Finance Act</a>, Section 63 of which said that: The <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a>, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the "cost" of the benefit meant an <a href="average%20cost">average of the cost</a> of providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the "cost" per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead <a href="marginal%20cost">marginal cost</a>, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would not be there already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the "concessionary fee" covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils. It was found, however, that during debate on the Finance Act, ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such "benefits" should be excluded from tax.

Following the report of the Special Commissioners, the case was appealed to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a>'s Chancery Division, where it was heard by <a href="John%20Vinelott">Vinelott J</a>. In his judgment (issued 24 November 1989), Vinelott decided, based on the act, that "any expense incurred" referred to the average cost of keeping pupils, not the costs of keeping the teachers' children as pupils, reversing the Special Commissioners' decision. The case was then heard by the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a>, which issued its judgment on 13 November 1990. The three judges confirmed Vinelott's decision, ignoring the "Hansard" element of the case and confirming that, based on the Act's text, "any expense incurred" referred to the average cost.

Again appealed, the case came before a 5-judge panel of the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. They initially agreed with the Court of Appeal by a 4–1 majority. At the end of the preliminary hearing, the judges became aware that, during the Finance Act's committee stage, <a href="Financial%20Secretary%20to%20the%20Treasury">Financial Secretary to the Treasury</a> <a href="Robert%20Sheldon%2C%20Baron%20Sheldon">Robert Sheldon</a> remarked (in response to a question about places for the children of teachers at fee-paying schools) "The removal of clause 54(4) will affect the position of a child of one of the teachers at the child's school because now the benefit will be assessed on the cost to the employer, which would be very small indeed in this case", implying that the "expense" is meant to be the cost to the school, not the average cost of having a pupil there. As a result of this discovery, the House of Lords chose to reconvene as a 7-judge panel, consisting of <a href="James%20Mackay%2C%20Baron%20Mackay%20of%20Clashfern">Lord Mackay</a>, <a href="Henry%20Keith%2C%20Baron%20Keith%20of%20Kinkel">Lord Keith</a>, <a href="Nigel%20Bridge%2C%20Baron%20Bridge%20of%20Harwich">Lord Bridge</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Griffiths%2C%20Baron%20Griffiths">Lord Griffiths</a>, <a href="Desmond%20Ackner%2C%20Baron%20Ackner">Lord Ackner</a>, <a href="Peter%20Oliver%2C%20Baron%20Oliver%20of%20Aylmerton">Lord Oliver</a> and <a href="Nicolas%20Browne-Wilkinson%2C%20Baron%20Browne-Wilkinson">Lord Browne-Wilkinson</a>.

The court reconvened and issued its judgment on 26 November 1992, read by Browne-Wilkinson. Browne-Wilkinson found in favour of Hart, and on the subject of "Hansard" wrote that:
My Lords, I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter of law, there are sound reasons for making a limited modification to the existing rule [that Hansard may not be used] unless there are constitutional or practical reasons which outweigh them. In my judgment, subject to the questions of the privileges of the House
of Commons, reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity. Even in such cases references in court to Parliamentary material should only be permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words. In the case of statements made in Parliament, as at present advised I cannot foresee that any statement other than the statement of the Minister or other promoter of the Bill is likely to meet these criteria.

In prior cases, the fear had been expressed that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate <a href="parliamentary%20privilege">parliamentary privilege</a>, under Article 9 of the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201688">Bill of Rights 1688</a> (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing what went on in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.

Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, in regards to legislative interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give effect to the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.

Mackay, in his dissenting judgment, came to the same conclusion as the rest of the House on the interpretation of the Finance Act, but without the use of "Hansard". Although he agreed that such a use would not violate Article 9, he argued that it was not appropriate: 
For several judges, the use of Sheldon's statement in Parliament was a deciding factor. In the initial hearing, Lords Bridge, Browne-Wilkinson and Oliver were all in favour of dismissing Hart's case, later changing their mind with the new evidence available to them. Lord Griffiths, on the other hand, was not swayed by the use of Sheldon's statement; he wrote that "I should myself have construed the section in favour of the taxpayer without recourse to Hansard".

Before "Pepper", it was impossible to use Parliamentary discussions as evidence in court cases; <a href="William%20Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> wrote in the 18th century that to allow judicial review of "unreasonable" legislation was to "set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Historically, the courts had been more lenient; while this suggestion first appears in the 14th century, with the intention that legislation was best interpreted by those who had written it, the principle was not strongly followed. In the 1678 case of "Ash v Abdy", <a href="Heneage%20Finch%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Nottingham">Lord Nottingham</a> chose to refer to the parliamentary history of the <a href="Statute%20of%20Frauds">Statute of Frauds</a>, and in "Millar v Taylor", in 1769, the first case to explicitly state this principle (as "The sense and meaning of an Act of Parliament must be collected from what it says when passed into law, and not from the history of changes it underwent in the House where it took its rise"), the court chose to depart from it. The principle was most used during the 19th and 20th centuries, with a noted example being "<a href="Beswick%20v%20Beswick">Beswick v Beswick</a>", where <a href="James%20Reid%2C%20Baron%20Reid">Lord Reid</a> maintained that it would be inconvenient and expensive for lawyers to have to refer to "<a href="Hansard">Hansard</a>" when preparing cases. Both the <a href="Law%20Commission%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">English</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Law%20Commission">Scottish Law Commission</a>s agreed with the rule in their 1969 "Report on the Interpretation of Statutes".

During the late 20th century there was a gradual "retreat" from this rule; in "Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation", the courts allowed "Hansard" material to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in "Pickstone v Freemans plc", it was allowed to assist in the understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by <a href="Lord%20Denning">Lord Denning</a> in "Davis v Johnson", where he said that asserting that the courts could not use "Hansard" was similar to saying that the judges "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should be able to look at the proceedings." Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of "Pepper" was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".

The decision in "Pepper" has been linked to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding since the end of the Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the <a href="literal%20rule">literal rule</a>, supplemented by the <a href="Golden%20rule%20%28law%29">golden</a> and <a href="mischief%20rule">mischief rule</a>s (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 <a href="Law%20Commission%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Law Commission</a> report "The Interpretation of Statutes", British courts began to use a more <a href="Purposive%20rule">purposive approach</a>, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>s. The impact of "Pepper" was to include "<a href="Hansard">Hansard</a>" in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.

In other <a href="common%20law">common law</a> jurisdictions, interpretation for similar situations is significantly different. In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, for example, four different interpretative doctrines are used in understanding taxation laws; "strict construction, purposive interpretation, the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total-context approach". In "<a href="Stubart%20Investments%20Limited%20v%20The%20Queen">Stubart Investments Limited v The Queen</a>", the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> decided to reject a strict approach and instead use the rule that "the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament". Since then, however, both the <a href="Purposive%20rule">purposive</a> and <a href="Plain%20meaning%20rule">plain meaning</a> approaches have been used. Academics have rejected the idea that legislative history should be an aid to statutory interpretation, arguing, "It would introduce intolerable uncertainty ... if clear language in a detailed provision of [an] Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court's view of the object and purpose
of the provision", and that it violates the rule of law, which requires that laws be performable. The average citizen does not have access to the legislative history of an Act, which under the "Pepper" approach could very well change the meaning of the statute completely.

<a href="United%20States">United States</a> courts regularly use such interpretation, partially because there are significant differences between the British and American legislative systems. In the United States, legislation is regularly subject to negotiation and alteration after being introduced to Congress, and so it is in the courts' interest to look at the particular Act's history when interpreting it. The range of sources accepted is "richer and more diverse", with individual Senators and Representatives and members of the Executive called to give evidence all valid. In the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, 145 decisions (approximately 20 percent of the decisions given) between 1996 and 2005 reference <a href="legislative%20history">legislative history</a>. In the House of Lords and <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</a>, only 9.8 percent of decisions use legislative history as a tool. It is noted, however, that the House of Lords and Supreme Court rely on statutes less often than the United States equivalent. Michael Healy, writing in the "Stanford Journal of International Law", notes that the use of statutory interpretation in the US Supreme Court combined with the uncertainty over what approach the court will take means lawyers have to write extremely broad arguments, increasing the cost of litigation — a concern raised in "Pepper".

J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Parliamentary%20Counsel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Office of the Parliamentary Counsel</a>, has expressed some approval at the decision. Firstly, he claims that it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to "Pepper", draftsmanship was a "time consuming" and "frustrating rather than enlightening" business. There are risks of "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the <a href="Renton%20Committee">Renton Committee</a> to ensure that "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed that no one would take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that "Pepper" may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called "Pepper" a "long overdue" decision from "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where <a href="parliamentary%20sovereignty">parliamentary sovereignty</a> is confirmed.

The House of Lords' statement on parliamentary privilege was assessed by the <a href="Joint%20committee%20%28legislative%29">Joint Committee</a> on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in "Pepper v Hart", but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic <a href="Aileen%20Kavanagh">Aileen Kavanagh</a> questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement can be used as evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; in the case of the <a href="Finance%20Act">Finance Act</a>, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28UK%29">Members of Parliament</a> may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the <a href="separation%20of%20powers%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">separation of powers in the United Kingdom</a>; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the <a href="HM%20Government">executive</a>, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.

With these issues, Kavanagh argues that there are likely to be consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single minister in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under "Pepper", every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of "Hansard" as a source; "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law".

The decision also contradicted previous precedent as to the nature of evidence. <a href="John%20Baker%20%28legal%20historian%29">John Baker</a> notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document, unless the evidence was found in said document. Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant; "no individual member of Parliament is in a position to state what that intention is or to speak for the silent majority. Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent. What passes in one House is not formally known to the other". An individual MP's statements, minister or not, may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply because they like the proposal itself.

J. C. Jenkins, who interprets "Pepper" as making the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier in some ways, also foresees it as making the job more difficult. Because of the added resources courts can draw on, there is now increased pressure to produce statutes which will not be interpreted in the wrong way. Departments sponsoring legislation normally prepare briefings for their ministers when talking in Parliament; draftsmen may now be expected to vet these, a time-consuming process. The draftsmen may also have to look at material produced by these departments other than the statutes, as it may be discussed in court; in "Pepper", <a href="Nicolas%20Browne-Wilkinson%2C%20Baron%20Browne-Wilkinson">Lord Browne-Wilkinson</a> considered a press release produced by the <a href="HM%20Revenue%20%26amp%3B%20Customs">Inland Revenue</a>. The decision also changes parliamentary practice. Under previous practice, if a minister was asked a question publicly and could not immediately reply with an answer, or publicly made a statement that later turned out to be incorrect, he would privately write a letter explaining or correcting himself. As a result of "Pepper", such private replies may have to be made publicly. In addition, Members of Parliament are more aware that their statements, and those statements they induct Ministers to make, may be looked at by the courts. As a result, these statements and inducements may be structured differently, and MPs may be more concerned that their issues be dealt with "at length and on the record", making parliamentary proceedings "more formal, more cluttered, and more protracted".

There has been a dispute over the interpretation of the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>' intent in regards to the use of "<a href="Hansard">Hansard</a>" in court, sparked by <a href="Johan%20Steyn%2C%20Baron%20Steyn">Lord Steyn</a>'s Hart Lecture on 16 May 2000, titled ""Pepper v Hart": A Re-examination". Steyn suggested that "Pepper v Hart" was limited to "an <a href="estoppel">estoppel</a> argument", and "Hansard"s use in court should "be confined to the admission against the executive of categorical assurances given by ministers to Parliament"; essentially, that "Hansard" should only be used if the purpose is to establish that ministers made certain assurances to Parliament, with the intent being to prevent the executive going back on its promises. <a href="Stefan%20Vogenauer">Stefan Vogenauer</a> disagrees that this was the House of Lords' intent in "Pepper", pointing out that Hart's counsel had, during proceedings, made an argument along the lines of estoppel — one the Lords had completely ignored when making their decision.

The courts' cautiously optimistic acceptance of "Pepper", which included an attempt to include it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, soon began to wane. Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of "Hansard", and the Lords itself initially followed it in "<a href="R%20v%20Warwickshire%20County%20Council%2C%20ex%20parte%20Johnson">R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson</a>", several objections and limits were expressed in later "<a href="obiter%20dicta">obiter dicta</a>" and "<a href="ratio%20decidendi">ratio decidendi</a>". The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by <a href="Leonard%20Hoffmann%2C%20Baron%20Hoffmann">Lord Hoffmann</a> in "The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings", where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created. In a speech to the Chancery Bar <a href="Peter%20Millett%2C%20Baron%20Millett">Lord Millett</a> calling the judgment "a regrettable decision" that "was not only misguided in practical terms, it was in my view contrary to principle", saying that: The courts immediately began to "whittle down" the precedent set by "Pepper". The first direct attack came through "Massey v Boulden", where the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a> held that "Hansard" could not be used in criminal law cases, because of "the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard".

In " Robinson v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland", Lords <a href="John%20Hobhouse%2C%20Baron%20Hobhouse%20of%20Woodborough">Hobhouse</a>, Hoffmann and Millett said that Mackay, with his dissenting judgment, had "turned out to be the better prophet", with large amounts of inefficiency and expense associated with "Pepper". In the "<a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Environment%2C%20Transport%20and%20the%20Regions%20v%20Spath%20Holme">Spath Holme</a>" judicial review case, Lords Bingham, Hope and Hutton held that "Hansard" could only be used in pursuit of "ascertaining the meaning of a particular word or phrase", rather than simply where a piece of legislation is "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity". In "<a href="McDonnell%20v%20Congregation%20of%20Christian%20Brothers%20Trustees">McDonnell</a>", the Lords further limited the use of "Hansard", saying it could not be used to overrule precedent set before courts were able to reference it, except in exceptional circumstances. "<a href="Wilson%20and%20others%20v%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Trade%20and%20Industry">Wilson and others v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</a>", the first case involving "Hansard" after the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Act%201998">Human Rights Act 1998</a> put further limits on its use; ministerial statements made in Parliament can not be treated as sources of law, only as supporting evidence. This "retreat" from "Pepper" was resisted in the Court of Appeal, primarily by Lord Phillips, who praised the decision following Steyn's lecture in 2000, but has been repeatedly emphasised in the House of Lords and <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</a>. As a result of these changes, <a href="Stefan%20Vogenauer">Stefan Vogenauer</a> has said that "the scope of Pepper v Hart has been reduced to such an extent that the ruling has almost become meaningless".

Despite the judicial criticism and limits placed on "Pepper", references to "Hansard" have apparently increased since the beginning of the 21st century. It is also noted that the most recent generation of House of Lords and Supreme Court judges have been willing to regularly reference legislative history in their arguments. In "<a href="Harding%20v%20Wealands">Harding v Wealands</a>", for example, three Law Lords were willing to apply "Pepper", even Lord Hoffmann who had previously voiced concerns. Lord Carswell noted that "Pepper" had been "out of judicial favour in recent years", but added that legislative history was "perhaps especially [useful] as a confirmatory aid".

Fall of Kampala

The Fall of Kampala, also known as the Liberation of Kampala (<a href="Kiswahili">Kiswahili</a>: "Kukombolewa kwa Kampala"), was a battle during the <a href="Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania%20War">Uganda–Tanzania War</a> in 1979, in which the combined forces of Tanzania and the <a href="Uganda%20National%20Liberation%20Front">Uganda National Liberation Front</a> (UNLF) attacked and captured the Ugandan capital, <a href="Kampala">Kampala</a>. As a result, Ugandan President <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a> was deposed, his forces were scattered, and a UNLF government was installed.

Amin had seized power in Uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship. Seven years later he attempted to invade Tanzania to the south. Tanzania repulsed the assault and launched a counter-attack into Ugandan territory. After <a href="Battle%20of%20Entebbe">routing</a> the Ugandans and their Libyan allies in <a href="Entebbe">Entebbe</a>, the Tanzanians revised their existing offensive designs for Kampala. The plans called for the 208th Brigade to advance from the south, spearheaded by Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya's 800-strong 19th Battalion, which was to secure the centre of the city. The 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion were to attack from the west, while the 201st Brigade was to establish roadblocks in the north to prevent Ugandan units from withdrawing. An eastern corridor was left open to allow the Libyans to evacuate to <a href="Jinja%2C%20Uganda">Jinja</a> and fly out of the country. Amin prepared for the defence of Kampala but fled through the gap.

The Tanzanians began their assault on the city on the morning of 10 April. The 19th Battalion moved cautiously down the Entebbe–Kampala road. Other battalions of the 208th advanced on <a href="Port%20Bell">Port Bell</a>. The 201st Brigade established its roadblocks north of Kampala and intercepted both forces attempting to reinforce Kampala from <a href="Bombo%2C%20Uganda">Bombo</a> and those attempting to effect a breakout. The 207th Brigade advanced from the west in tandem with the UNLF battalion, which secured <a href="Nateete">Nateete</a> and passed through <a href="Rubaga">Rubaga</a>. One of the 207th's battalions seized <a href="Kasubi%20hill">Kasubi hill</a> and the <a href="Kasubi%20Tombs">royal tomb</a> of the <a href="Kabaka%20of%20Buganda">Kabakas</a>. The 19th Battalion encountered only sporadic resistance and was greeted by crowds of rejoicing civilians. Upon reaching Kampala's city centre, the unit, lacking maps, had trouble navigating the streets. The Tanzanians secured the radio station and set up a command post on <a href="Kololo">Kololo</a> hill. The UNLF battalion occupied Republic House—the Ugandan army's headquarters at the edge of the city—unopposed, but was unable to take the State Research Bureau at <a href="Nakasero">Nakasero</a>. Men of the 207th and 208th Brigades seized the southern and western portions of the city. The few Libyan units in the area put up little resistance, most having retreated to Jinja.

By dawn on 11 April, Tanzanian troops had cut off all routes leaving Kampala, including the road to Jinja, and began eliminating remaining pockets of resistance. Some UNLF forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with the Amin regime, while others attacked <a href="Kakwa%20people">Kakwa</a> and <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a>, both ethnic groups that had benefited from the dictatorship. Later in the morning Tanzanian artillery bombarded parts of the city. The remaining Ugandan soldiers in the city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles. Casualty statistics are not exact, though Tanzanian losses are estimated to be light and dozens of Ugandan soldiers and civilians are believed to have died. The battle marked the first time in the history of the continent that an African state seized the capital of another African country and deposed its government. In the immediate aftermath civilians engaged in rampant looting, despite the attempts of Tanzanian and UNLF troops to maintain order. A new Ugandan government was established by the UNLF. Though pro-Amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital, combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the Sudanese border and eliminated the last resistance.

In 1971 <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a> launched <a href="1971%20Ugandan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a military coup</a> that overthrew the President of <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="Milton%20Obote">Milton Obote</a>, precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. Tanzanian President <a href="Julius%20Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a> had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation. Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a brutal dictatorship. Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. He tacitly supported a failed attempt by Obote to overthrow Amin in 1972, and after a brief border conflict he and Amin signed a peace accord. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania.

Uganda's economy languished under Amin's corrupt rule and instability fermented in the armed forces. Following a failed mutiny in late October 1978, Ugandan troops crossed over the Tanzanian border in pursuit of rebellious soldiers. On 1 November Amin announced that he was annexing the <a href="Kagera%20Region">Kagera Salient</a> in northern Tanzania. Tanzania halted the sudden invasion, mobilised anti-Amin opposition groups, and launched a counter-offensive. Nyerere told foreign diplomats that he did not intend to depose Amin, but only "teach him a lesson". The claim was not believed; Nyerere despised Amin, and he made statements to some of his colleagues about overthrowing him. The Tanzanian Government also felt that the northern border would not be secure unless the threat presented by Amin was eliminated. After initial advances into Ugandan territory, Major General <a href="David%20Msuguri">David Msuguri</a> was appointed commander of the <a href="Tanzania%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force">Tanzania People's Defence Force</a> (TPDF)'s 20th Division and ordered to push further into the country.

On 24 February 1979 the TPDF <a href="Battle%20of%20Masaka">seized</a> <a href="Masaka">Masaka</a>. Nyerere originally planned to halt his forces there and allow Ugandan exiles to attack <a href="Kampala">Kampala</a>, the Ugandan capital, and overthrow Amin. He feared that scenes of Tanzanian troops occupying the city would reflect poorly on the country's image abroad. The fall of Masaka surprised and deeply troubled Ugandan commanders, who felt that the defeat made Kampala vulnerable to attack. They mobilised additional forces and began planning for a defence of the city. Some troops were sent to <a href="Lukaya%2C%20Uganda">Lukaya</a>, where they <a href="Battle%20of%20Lukaya">vainly attempted</a> to halt the Tanzanian advance.

In late March Ugandan opposition groups met in <a href="Moshi%2C%20Tanzania">Moshi</a>. They elected <a href="Yusuf%20Lule">Yusuf Lule</a> chairman of the <a href="Uganda%20National%20Liberation%20Front">Uganda National Liberation Front</a> (UNLF) and established a cabinet. The next day President <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> of <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, an ally of Amin, attempted to stem the advance by sending an ultimatum to Nyerere, demanding that he withdraw his forces in 24 hours or face the opposition of Libyan troops (which were already operating in Uganda). Nyerere rejected the threat in a radio broadcast, announcing that Libya's entry into the war did not change the Tanzanian government's view of Amin. Ugandan rebel forces did not have the strength to defeat Libyan units, so Nyerere decided to use the TPDF to take Kampala. Tanzanian leaders were also inclined to capture the city after Ugandan planes bombed <a href="Kagera%20Region">Kagera</a> and following Amin's announcement that the inhabitants of Masaka and <a href="Mbarara">Mbarara</a> would face retaliation for welcoming the Tanzanian invasion. The successful formation of the UNLF government eased Tanzanian concerns about the aftermath of a seizure of the capital. On 25 March Amin imposed a curfew in Kampala, which was home to 400,000 residents. Four days later the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> announced that it would evacuate the approximately 140 dependents of its Kampala staff to Kenya. On 31 March the Tanzanians drew up their plans of attack.

In early April Tanzanian forces began to concentrate their efforts on weakening the Ugandan position in Kampala. Tanzanian commanders had originally assumed that Amin would station the bulk of his forces in the capital, and their initial plans called for a direct attack on the city. But from the high ground in <a href="Mpigi">Mpigi</a> they could see the <a href="Entebbe">Entebbe</a> peninsula, where there was heavy Libyan air traffic and a large contingent of Ugandan and Libyan soldiers. If the TPDF seized Kampala before securing the town of Entebbe, it would be susceptible to a flanking attack. Taking Entebbe would cut off Uganda's Libyan reinforcements and permit an assault on the capital from the south. Msuguri made the decision to attack the peninsula first, and ordered the 208th Brigade to secure it. A preliminary bombardment frightened Amin in his official residence, the Entebbe State House, and he fled via helicopter to Kampala. On 7 April the brigade <a href="Battle%20of%20Entebbe">advanced into the town</a>. Many Libyan soldiers attempted to evacuate to Kampala but were intercepted and killed. Following the seizure of Entebbe, hundreds of Ugandan soldiers garrisoning Kampala fled. The remnants of the Libyan force joined the remaining Ugandan troops and took up positions around the capital. Their morale was extremely low.
On the morning of 8 April Tanzanian officers held a final meeting in the Entebbe State House before the attack on Kampala. Brigadier Mwita Marwa, commander of the 208th Brigade, conducted the briefing. Nyerere requested that his commanders leave the eastern road from the city leading to <a href="Jinja%2C%20Uganda">Jinja</a> be left clear so Libyan troops and foreign diplomats could evacuate. He thought that by letting the Libyans escape, Libya could avoid humiliation and quietly withdraw from the war. Nyerere also feared that further conflict with Libyan troops would incite Afro-Arab tensions and invite the armed belligerence of other Arab states. He sent a message to Gaddafi explaining his decision, saying that the Libyans could be airlifted out of Uganda unopposed from the airstrip in Jinja. He further requested that his forces avoid damaging key buildings in Kampala, including <a href="Mulago%20Hospital">Mulago Hospital</a>, <a href="Makerere%20University">Makerere University</a>, and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Uganda">Parliament of Uganda</a>. The Tanzanian plan of attack called for an advance by the 207th Brigade and a UNLF battalion from the west along the road from Masaka with a simultaneous assault from Entebbe in the south by the 208th Brigade. The latter's 19th Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya was earmarked for the seizure of the city centre, while other units were to cover their flanks in the bush. The 201st Brigade was to maintain a "blocking action" north of Kampala to prevent Ugandan forces from escaping. The entire operation was supposed to take three days to complete.

Amin made final preparations for the defence of the capital, and General <a href="Dusman%20Sabuni">Dusman Sabuni</a> was left in charge of the defences. According to the "<a href="Africa%20Research%20Bulletin">Africa Research Bulletin</a>", there were approximately 1,000 soldiers garrisoning the city, while journalist John Darnton reported on 9 April an estimate that Amin had 2,000 to 3,000 men just south of the capital as "a last line of defence". Many civilians fled in anticipation of a battle, though Minister of Commerce Muhammad Bakhit declared that they had to return within two days or have their property "reallocated". (Kampala District Commissioner Wahib Muhammed claimed that a week before the Tanzanian attack Amin ordered all soldiers in the Kampala garrison to evacuate their families, and that most of the army subsequently withdrew "with a lot of discipline".) On 8 April the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s diplomats evacuated to Kenya in a convoy, accompanied by the personnel of other <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a> legations.

The 800-strong 19th Battalion entrenched itself on a hill 21 kilometres away from Kampala overlooking the road from Entebbe. Throughout the night of 8 April the battalion command post faced harassing fire from a tank. Ugandan reconnaissance patrols engaged in sporadic fighting with Tanzanian defences while artillery bombarded Kampala's suburbs. At 03:30 on 9 April the 19th Battalion descended from its position. Shortly afterwards, Tanzanian artillery began a 15-minute bombardment of Ugandan positions around Kampala. The battalion reassembled on the Entebbe–Kampala road and began its advance. Two companies advanced parallel through the bush on both sides of the road to screen for ambushes. The rest of the battalion split into companies that walked on the dirt shoulders of the road, the units staggered on alternating sides. They occasionally paused to ensure the advance units stayed ahead. At 09:00, having covered the distance necessitated by the battle plan, the battalion re-encamped itself around a residence along the side of the road. The 207th Brigade occupied <a href="Mutundwe">Mutundwe</a>.

On the morning of 10 April TPDF reconnaissance forces reported that the Ugandan defences around Kampala were weak. Though most units were not yet in position, Tanzanian forces were ordered to seize the capital. The 19th Battalion vacated its position and assembled on the Entebbe–Kampala road. Other battalions of the 208th secured Cape Town View (Amin's villa on <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>) and advanced on <a href="Port%20Bell">Port Bell</a>. The 201st Brigade led by Brigadier Imran Kombe established roadblocks north of Kampala and intercepted both forces attempting to reinforce Kampala from <a href="Bombo%2C%20Uganda">Bombo</a> and those attempting to effect a breakout. Over the course of the day they destroyed seven vehicles and killed 80 Ugandan soldiers. The 207th Brigade under Brigadier <a href="John%20Butler%20Walden">John Walden</a> advanced from the west in tandem with a UNLF battalion under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="David%20Oyite-Ojok">David Oyite-Ojok</a>. Ojok's men secured <a href="Nateete">Nateete</a> and passed through <a href="Rubaga">Rubaga</a>. One of the 207th's battalions seized <a href="Kasubi%20hill">Kasubi hill</a> and the <a href="Kasubi%20Tombs">royal tomb</a> of the <a href="Kabaka%20of%20Buganda">Kabakas</a>, the kings of <a href="Buganda">Buganda</a>.
The 19th Battalion began its advance at 03:36, accompanied by freelance journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey. The TPDF initiated a heavy 90-minute-long artillery bombardment of the Kampala at dawn, and another barrage later in the morning. Windows were shattered by the explosions, and several buildings and roads were struck. Only a few civilian casualties were reported, as most of the city's residents left the streets and sought shelter indoors. As the 19th Battalion moved down the Entebbe–Kampala road with its three tanks (a <a href="Type%2059%20tank">T-59</a> and two <a href="T-62">T-62</a>s), it was joined by an increasing number of celebratory civilians, eager for the removal of the Amin regime. The column did not encounter resistance until it came under small-arms fire near the <a href="Makindye">Makindye</a> roundabout from a marketplace by the left side of the road, about two kilometres from the centre of the city. The Tanzanian troops took cover in a drainage ditch and returned fire while the civilians scattered. Fire was exchanged for 10 minutes until the source of the opposition, a limousine occupied by five Ugandan soldiers armed with semi-automatic weapons, emerged from cover and drove towards the Tanzanian column. It was quickly destroyed with small-arms fire, a <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a>, and a 75 mm tank shell. The Tanzanians searched the market but found no more Ugandans, and subsequently resumed their march into the capital, joined by the cheering civilians. The battalion received some harassing fire but took no casualties and at 17:00 reached the clock tower in Kampala where the Entebbe road entered the downtown.

Msuya was eager to complete his battalion's objectives in the two hours remaining before nightfall. His decisions were complicated by the fact that he had no map of Kampala and had to rely upon a Ugandan guide for directions. He resolved to secure the radio station first. Leaving a guard behind to prevent the civilians from following, the battalion moved out into in city streets but with only the guide's confused and limited directions, its progress was slow. The Bank of Uganda, Post Office, Parliament, and the <a href="Kampala%20Serena%20Hotel">Nile Mansion Hotel</a> were secured with only minimal resistance. The Tanzanians faced stiffer opposition at the Ministry of Internal Affairs building. Most of the Ugandan leadership had fled, leaving their defences confused and uncoordinated. Aside from a brief firefight with Ugandan soldiers positioned in a balcony, the 19th Battalion located the Radio Uganda station without incident. Though its equipment was intact, Msuya was under orders not to make any broadcasts (he told a junior officer, "This is almost worth getting court-martialed for.").

The Tanzanians repulsed a brief ambush from an adjacent skyscraper before considering their next move. They were supposed to secure <a href="Nakasero">Nakasero</a> hill, the location of the State Research Bureau (Amin's secret police) and the presidential residence, and <a href="Kololo">Kololo</a> hill, home to Amin's personal "Command Post", before nightfall. Msuya determined that only one area could be seized in the time frame, and of the two choices Kololo presented a safer location for an overnight encampment. Meanwhile the UNLF battalion occupied Republic House, the Ugandan army's headquarters at the edge of the city. They were unopposed, but five men were killed by friendly fire when Tanzanian artillery bombarded the site, the gunners unaware that it had been taken. At around nightfall the UNLF force approached the State Research Bureau at Nakasero in the belief that it had been abandoned. When the unit was close, Ugandan soldiers opened fire, destroying a <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a> and forcing the UNLF to retreat. The Ugandans later abandoned the Bureau, but threw grenades into the holding cells in an attempt to kill the last prisoners.
While the bulk of the 19th Battalion set out for Kololo, a detached company set up an ambush position in a park overlooking a street that led towards the Jinja road. The Tanzanians attacked two passing Ugandan Land Rovers, killing their three occupants. In one of the vehicles the soldiers recovered a detailed plan for Kampala's defence which specified the battalions and commanders responsible for each sector; most had already dispersed. By nightfall the 19th Battalion had not located the Command Post. Kampala was quiet and there was no electricity in the entire city, with the exception of a single traffic light. Eventually the Ugandan guide directed the unit to a golf course which the troops cut across to the base of Kololo. By 21:00 the Tanzanians were following residential streets up the hill. Frustrated by his guide's inability to locate the Command Post, Msuya decided to forgo the location and establish his own command post in an abandoned home whilst his battalion dug trenches and established roadblocks. According to him, by 22:00 Kampala was under Tanzanian control. At 23:00 he held a <a href="Toast%20%28honor%29">toast</a> with his officers to celebrate the capture of the city.

Overnight several other battalions of the 208th moved into the southern portion of Kampala, while the 207th occupied the west. Brigadier Walden oversaw the capture of Amin's residence. The few Libyan units in the city put up little resistance. Most retreated to Jinja and then to Ethiopia and Kenya to await repatriation. Amin also fled to Jinja, though how and precisely when are not agreed upon. The UNLF battalion established its camp in the golf course. As the troops were settling down a small white car drove by and an occupant opened fire, mortally wounding an officer. The UNLF subsequently erected roadblocks around the location. The men maintaining them grew drunk throughout the night on pillaged beer and whisky.

By dawn of 11 April Tanzanian troops had cut off all routes leaving Kampala, including the road to Jinja, and began eliminating the remaining pockets of resistance. Some UNLF forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with the Amin regime, while others attacked <a href="Kakwa%20people">Kakwa</a> and <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a>, both ethnic groups that had benefited from the dictatorship. At 04:00 the East German ambassador, <a href="Gottfried%20Lessing">Gottfried Lessing</a>, and his wife left their residence in a small white car with another vehicle following in an attempt to escape the city. When they drove by the golf course the UNLF fired two rocket-propelled grenades, destroying the cars and killing the four occupants. As the morning progressed the UNLF soldiers manning the roadblocks drunkenly harassed passing civilians and Tanzanian soldiers.

Ojok proceeded to Radio Uganda to announce the fall of Amin's regime. According to Honey and Avirgan, Ojok had long desired to inform the Ugandan people that they were free of the dictatorship, but Lule had sent a message to the UNLF forces, prohibiting Ojok from making any broadcasts. Lule feared that Ojok would declare the restoration of Obote's presidential regime (Ojok and Obote had been long-time allies in the resistance against Amin). Honey and Avirgan stated that upon reaching the station Ojok placed two phone calls to Dar es Salaam. The first was to Nyerere, who was not present, though a message was recorded by a security officer. The second was to Obote. Ojok reportedly told Obote that he intended to announce the capture of Kampala in the name of the UNLF, to which Obote expressed his approval. According to historian Kenneth Ingham, Ojok asked Obote for direction on what to say, and he was instructed to appeal for support of a new national government without mentioning Obote or his party, the <a href="Uganda%20People%27s%20Congress">Uganda People's Congress</a>. Journalist Timothy Kalyegira wrote that Obote dictated an announcement which Ojok wrote on an envelope. Msuya asserted that Ojok had initially refused to make any declaration, saying "If our friends in Moshi and Dar es Salaam hear me reading this, they will think I have taken over." Msuya told the "<a href="Daily%20Monitor">Daily Monitor</a>", "I literally held a gun on Oyite-Ojok's head to read the communiqué...I told him someone has got to say something and that person has got to be a Ugandan." Despite the persistence of gunfire, several technicians arrived for their scheduled workday and assisted Ojok in making the broadcast. His declaration was straightforward; he stated that Amin's government was deposed and that Kampala was under the control of the UNLF, and appealed to residents to remain calm and for Ugandan soldiers to surrender. Lule was infuriated by the broadcast and a prerecorded speech by him was not played on Radio Uganda until later that evening.
Later in the morning Tanzanian artillery bombarded parts of the city. Most Ugandan soldiers quickly broke and fled upon being subjected to shelling. More civilians, seeing that the troops on their streets were Tanzanian, came out from their dwellings to celebrate and loot. Some pointed out remaining pockets of resistance to the TPDF. Meanwhile, the diplomatic staff resident on Kololo hill felt it was safe enough to begin visiting Msuya's command post to pay their respects to him. Civilians raided the files of the State Research Bureau in search of records that contained the whereabouts of missing family members. The Tanzanians found among the documents a copy of their top-secret plan of attack for Kampala. Lieutenant Colonel Salim Hassan Boma led a detachment on a sweep of the capital, and on the edge of the city they discovered <a href="Luzira%20Maximum%20Security%20Prison">Luzira Prison</a>, where over 1,700 prisoners were held; Boma ordered them all to be set free.

The remaining Ugandan soldiers in the city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles. They robbed residents at gunpoint and in some cases murdered them to secure the items. As Tanzanian patrols secured Kampala's neighbourhoods, some of them stumbled across the Ugandan soldiers and exchanged fire with them. Three of the latter attempted to rob the residence of the First Secretary of the French Embassy, but were driven away by gunfire from the secretary's wife. Withdrawing troops also looted properties on <a href="Mulago">Mulago hill</a>. At least 10 Ugandan soldiers were beaten to death by enraged civilians armed with furniture and pieces of wood. Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Juma%20Butabika">Juma Butabika</a>, one of Amin's top commanders, was killed in a firefight with soldiers of the 205th and 208th Brigades in the <a href="Bwaise">Bwaise</a>–<a href="Kawempe">Kawempe</a> area as they moved in from <a href="Mityana">Mityana</a> to secure the northern section of the city. Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Kisule, the commander of an artillery unit based in <a href="Masindi">Masindi</a>, surrendered in the capital, as did the Ugandan Army's chief medical officer, Brigadier G. D. Bogere.

Meanwhile, Kampala's residents engaged in rampant looting, despite the attempts of Tanzanian and UNLF troops to maintain order. A few looters were active in the morning and only targeted the homes of Amin's lieutenants but, by the afternoon, many were crowding the streets and pillaging property indiscriminately. Stores had their windows smashed and were cleared of furniture, documents were destroyed, and new cars were pushed out of show rooms and onto the streets. Some buildings were set on fire. The Ministry of Health's offices were raided by its own employees. In what most observers described as the boldest incident of looting in the entire war, the six-foot-thick door to the vault of the <a href="Barclays%20Bank%20of%20Uganda">Barclays Bank of Uganda</a> main branch building was breached with plastic explosives and 2.25 million shillings stolen. Msuya felt that the only way to stop the pillaging would be to open fire on the crowds, which would generate a highly negative response from the population. Instead, he ordered his men to quietly assist the looters in breaking into the warehouses and try to keep the situation calm. This strategy failed, as two civilians were accidentally killed in the pandemonium. Eventually the Tanzanians were authorised to seize a radio and a watch each from abandoned homes. According to a "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" report, the evening of 11 April "came to be called the 'Night of the Wheel-barrows,'" in allusion to civilians carting away property.

On 11 April following the reception of news of the fall of Kampala, Sudanese guards were placed on alert at the Ugandan frontier. Shortly thereafter Ugandan refugees began steadily fleeing over the border. On 12 April Amin delivered a rambling radio broadcast in which he denounced Ojok's speech and declared that his forces still held Kampala. He then boarded an aircraft in <a href="Arua">Arua</a> and flew to Libya. He eventually settled in exile in Saudi Arabia and never returned to Uganda. The next day a band of lingering Ugandan soldiers in Kampala shot a Tanzanian sentry in front of the Bank of Uganda. Tanzanian sappers promptly razed the building the group was hiding in. Looting decreased over the following days, but random shootings occurred throughout the city. A small number of Ugandan and Libyan troops remained in hiding, and on 15 April three Libyans were killed while attempting to steal a car. In the days following the city's capture Tanzanian soldiers maintained roadblocks and checkpoints.

Kampala was left damaged by the Tanzanian artillery bombardment and the looting. Electricity and water services were restored to a portion of the population a few days after the battle. In early May civilians and municipal officials cleaned up most of the debris and boarded up the smashed windows. When petrol became available, tow trucks recovered the vehicles abandoned across Kampala. Makerere University students created a campaign to return looted office equipment to government buildings. Reconstruction efforts were slow and the city displayed signs of dilapidation several years after the battle. As late as 2000, ruins from the conflict remained along Kampala Road in the city centre.

Casualty statistics were unclear in the immediate aftermath of the battle. According to Honey, fewer than 100 Ugandan soldiers were killed. The Tanzanians estimated that 25 to 30 Ugandan soldiers had died in the city. The Superintendent of Mortuaries supervised the collection of bodies, and by 15 April he had recovered over 200 dead Ugandan soldiers and civilians. He estimated that the total count could be as high as 500. Journalist Baldwin Mzirai stated that 300 corpses were found. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" reported the deaths of "dozens of soldiers and civilians". According to the "Daily Monitor", potentially several dozen Ugandan civilians were killed. Over 500 Ugandan soldiers were captured by the TPDF. They were temporarily housed on Kololo before being deported to prisoner-of-war camps in Tanzania. Kisule was attached to a battalion of the TPDF's 205th Brigade to act as its guide and assist it in the capture of Masindi. Sabuni was arrested by the UNLF and charged with murder. He later died in custody from undernourishment. The Libyans' few casualties during the battle included some deaths. The TPDF casualties were also deemed to be light; only three members of the 19th Battalion were wounded in the fighting. Large stocks of Libyan munitions were seized, as were significant caches of Ugandan weapons imported from the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, Israel, and Spain.

The Tanzanians recovered the body of Hans Poppe, a biracial Tanzanian police officer who had been killed by the Ugandans in a 1971 border clash. His corpse had been put on display by Amin as evidence that foreign mercenaries were being deployed against him. The body was repatriated and buried. Searches of Amin's residence at Nakasero uncovered a basement occupied by starving prisoners and rotting corpses. Immediately after the seizure of Kampala the TPDF began establishing a new Ugandan government. Msuya was tasked with running errands on behalf of the UNLF ministers, while Walden's 207th Brigade was ordered to assume occupation duties throughout the entirety of Kampala. The 201st Brigade proceeded from its position in the north to take Bombo and the 208th moved out to capture Jinja.

Amin's forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital. Discipline in the Ugandan Army faltered and the command hierarchy collapsed. According to Ugandan Major <a href="Bernard%20Rwehururu">Bernard Rwehururu</a>, news of the defeat provoked desertions among the Ugandan ranks, and many officers withdrew to the <a href="West%20Nile%20sub-region">West Nile sub-region</a> or fled the country. Many northern soldiers, feeling the conflict was primarily a southern affair, had little motivation to continue fighting away from their home territories, while some men began accusing the units which had fought in the south of performing poorly and losing the war. The 250-strong garrison of <a href="Mbale">Mbale</a> defected and established roadblocks around the town to protect it from Amin's forces while awaiting the arrival of the TPDF. A handful of forces rallied in Masindi to plan a counterattack to retake Kampala. Further Tanzanian advances prompted the Ugandans to abandon the town. After Kampala's capture, little further damage was caused by the fighting in Uganda. Combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the Sudanese border and eliminated the last resistance. 

Caught unprepared by the fall of Kampala, Lule hurriedly compiled a list of ministers meant to represent the ethnic balances of the country. On 13 April he was flown into the city and installed as President of Uganda. The UNLF government's operations were greatly hampered by the looting of equipment from state offices. It did not pursue legal action against the looters, and an appeal for the return of state property was modestly successful. Nyerere's decision to use his army to drive far into Ugandan territory and depose Amin resulted in Tanzania becoming deeply involved in Ugandan affairs in the aftermath of the war, against his intentions. After a three year-long occupation, the TPDF withdrew from Uganda in 1981.

The fall of Kampala marked the first time in the history of the continent that an African state seized the capital of another African country. The overthrow of a sovereign head of state by a foreign military had never occurred in Africa and had been strongly discouraged by the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a> (OAU). At an OAU conference in July 1979, President <a href="Gaafar%20Nimeiry">Gaafar Nimeiry</a> of Sudan said that the war had set a "serious precedent" and noted that the organisation's charter "prohibits interference in other people's internal affairs and invasion of their territory by armed force." Nigerian Head of State <a href="Olusegun%20Obasanjo">Olusegun Obasanjo</a> shared similar concerns. Some observers dissented from this line of thought and argued that the situation demonstrated that the OAU charter needed reform. Nyerere accused the OAU of shielding black African leaders from criticism, noting that Amin's regime had killed more people than the white minority governments in southern Africa. President <a href="Godfrey%20Binaisa">Godfrey Binaisa</a>, Lule's successor, praised the Tanzanian intervention.

Despite the controversy, most Western and African states tacitly accepted the action. According to Roy May and <a href="Oliver%20Furley">Oliver Furley</a>, Amin's removal "marked a mile-post in the history of Africa." On the fifth anniversary of the fall of Kampala, Obote delivered a speech to commemorate the liberation of Uganda from the Amin regime. Footage from the event was included in the 1980 Tanzania Film Company and Audio Visual Institute colour documentary chronicling the war, "Vita vya Kagera". Avirgan and Honey included an account of the battle in their 1983 book on the Uganda–Tanzania War, "War in Uganda: The legacy of Idi Amin". Though the widespread looting of Kampala was unprecedented in Ugandan history, no comprehensive study of the phenomenon was ever undertaken.

Boletus aereus

Boletus aereus, the dark cep or bronze bolete, is a highly prized and much sought-after <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> in the family <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a>. The <a href="bolete">bolete</a> is widely consumed in Spain (<a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> and <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a>), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. Described as a new species in 1789 by French <a href="mycology">mycologist</a> <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a>, it is closely related to several other European boletes, including "<a href="Boletus%20reticulatus">B. reticulatus</a>", "<a href="Boletus%20pinophilus">B. pinophilus</a>", and the popular "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">B. edulis</a>". Some populations in North Africa have been classified as a separate species, "<a href="Boletus%20mamorensis">B. mamorensis</a>", although they are <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> very close.

The fungus predominantly grows in habitats with broad-leaved trees and shrubs, forming <a href="symbiotic">symbiotic</a> <a href="mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a> associations in which the underground roots of these plants are enveloped with sheaths of fungal tissue (<a href="hypha">hypha</a>e). The cork oak ("<a href="Quercus%20suber">Quercus suber</a>") is a key <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a>. The fungus produces <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body has a large dark brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, which can reach in diameter. Like other boletes, "B. aereus" has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface of the fruit body is whitish when young, but ages to a greenish-yellow. The squat brown <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, or stem, is up to 15 cm (6 in) tall and thick and partially covered with a raised network pattern, or <a href="wikt%3Areticulate">reticulation</a>.

French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> <a href="species%20description">described</a> "Boletus aereus" in 1789. The species epithet is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "aerěus", meaning "made with bronze or copper". His countryman <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> transferred the species to the now-obsolete genus "Dictyopus" in 1886, which resulted in the <a href="Synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> "Dictyopus aereus", while <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Maire">René Maire</a> reclassified it as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "B. edulis" in 1937. In 1940, Manuel Cabral de Rezende-Pinto published the <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "B. aereus" var. "squarrosus" from collections made in Brazil, but this taxon is not considered to be <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomically</a> distinct.

In works published before 1987, the binomial name was written fully as "Boletus aereus" Fr., as the description by Bulliard had been <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> ("i.e.", treated as if <a href="conserved%20name">conserved</a> against earlier <a href="Homonym%20%28biology%29">homonyms</a> and competing synonyms) in 1821 by the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a>. The starting date for all the <a href="mycota">mycota</a> had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821, the date of Fries' work. The 1987 edition of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> revised the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi; names can now be considered valid as far back as 1 May 1753, hence predating publication of Bulliard's work.

Moroccan collections under the cork oak ("<a href="Quercus%20suber">Quercus suber</a>") that were initially regarded as "B. aereus" were described as a separate species—"<a href="Boletus%20mamorensis">Boletus mamorensis</a>"—in 1978, on the basis of a <a href="rufous">rufous</a> <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> cap and a rooting <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to "B. aereus", likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist <a href="Harry%20Thiers">Harry Thiers</a> reported "Boletus aereus" from <a href="California">California</a> in 1975; a taxonomic revision of western North American <a href="Boletus%20edulis%23Related%20species">porcini</a> boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, "<a href="Boletus%20regineus">Boletus regineus</a>". These differ from "B. aereus" by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (<a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>), and belong in a different porcini <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a>.

"Boletus aereus" is classified in "Boletus" <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Boletus", alongside close relatives such as "<a href="Boletus%20reticulatus">B. reticulatus</a>", "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">B. edulis</a>", and "<a href="Boletus%20pinophilus">B. pinophilus</a>". A genetic study of the four European species found that "B. aereus" was <a href="sister%20taxon">sister</a> to "B. reticulatus". More extensive testing of worldwide taxa revealed that "B. aereus" and the genetically close "B. mamorensis" were sister to a lineage that had split into "B. reticulatus" and two lineages that had been classified as "B. edulis" from southern China and Korea/northern China respectively. Molecular analysis suggests that the "B. aereus/mamorensis" and "B. reticulatus"/Chinese "B." "edulis" lineages <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> around 6 to 7 million years ago.

Bulliard gave "Boletus aereus" the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> of "le bolet bronzé" (the bronze bolete) in 1789, noting that it was called the "cep noir" (black cep) in other countries. It is commonly known as "ontto beltza" (black fungus) in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, "porcino nero" (black piglet) in <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, and "Cèpe bronzé" in <a href="French%20language">French</a>. In <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> it is known as "vasilikό" (the royal one), or "kalogeraki" (little monk). The English common name is "dark cep", while the <a href="British%20Mycological%20Society">British Mycological Society</a> also approved the name "bronze bolete".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is hemispherical to convex, reaching in diameter, although specimens of have been found in some cases. Slightly velvety and lobed or dented, it is dark brown, greyish-brown, violet brown, or purple brown, often with copper, golden, or olivaceous patches. The stipe is high by wide, usually shorter than the cap diameter, initially barrel shaped but gradually becoming club shaped and tapering at the base. The stipe is pale brown, chestnut, or reddish brown in colour, covered in a brown or concolorous reticulation. As with other boletes, there are <a href="Hymenophore">tubes</a> rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of the cap. The tube openings—known as pores—are small and rounded. Whitish or greyish-white when young, they slowly become yellowish or greenish yellow at maturity, and can turn <a href="wine%20%28color%29">wine</a> coloured with bruising. The tubes themselves are initially white, later becoming yellowish or olivaceous. The thick <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is white, exudes a robust and pleasant smell reminiscent of <a href="hazelnut">hazelnut</a>s, and has a mild sweet taste.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are spindle shaped and measure 10.5–19 by 4–7 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. The pileipellis is a <a href="Pileipellis%23Trichoderm">trichodermium</a> of interwoven <a href="septate">septate</a> <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, with long cylindrical cells.

"<a href="Boletus%20reticulatus">Boletus reticulatus</a>" is very similar to "B. aereus", also occurring during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.

"<a href="Boletus%20pinophilus">Boletus pinophilus</a>" occurs under <a href="conifers">conifers</a>, mostly "<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">Pinus sylvestris</a>", and has a reddish-brown cap. Microscopically, it can be separated by the more inflated, club- to spindle-shaped hyphal ends of the pileipellis.

"<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" occurs later in the season during lower temperatures, mostly under "<a href="Picea">Picea</a>". It has a paler viscid cap, and a paler stipe with an acute white reticulation. Microscopically, it has gelatinised hyphal ends in the pileipellis.

Found mainly in Central and Southern Europe as well as North Africa, "Boletus aereus" is rare in colder climates such as England, and classified as a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> in the Czech Republic. "Boletus aereus" can be locally abundant; it is the most common bolete in the woodlands of <a href="Madonie%20Regional%20Natural%20Park">Madonie Regional Natural Park</a> in northern <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Red List</a> of endangered species of <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>. "Boletus aereus" has been reported from several other <a href="island%20ecology">island ecosystems</a> across the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, such as <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Lesvos">Lesvos</a>, and <a href="Naxos">Naxos</a>.

Mushrooms are mostly found during hot spells in summer and autumn, growing in <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association with various broad-leaved trees and <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a>ous shrubs, especially oak ("<a href="Quercus">Quercus</a>"), beech ("<a href="Beech">Fagus</a>"), chestnut ("<a href="Chestnut">Castanea</a>"), strawberry trees ("<a href="Arbutus">Arbutus</a>"), treeheath ("<a href="Erica">Erica</a>"), and rockrose ("<a href="Cistus">Cistus</a>"), showing a preference for <a href="acid%20soil">acid soil</a>s. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, and the distribution of "B. aereus" (along with "B. mamorensis") aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>e that "B. aereus" forms with sweet chestnut ("<a href="Castanea%20sativa">Castanea sativa</a>") and downy oak ("<a href="Quercus%20pubescens">Quercus pubescens</a>") have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal <a href="clamp%20connections">clamps</a>, a <a href="plectenchymatous">plectenchymatous</a> mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.

In the past the fungus had been reported in China. Recent molecular studies show that Asian porcini appear to belong to different species.

A choice <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible species</a>, "Boletus aereus" is highly appreciated in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, and is considered by many to be gastronomically superior to "Boletus edulis". In the vicinity of <a href="Borgo%20Val%20di%20Taro">Borgotaro</a> in the <a href="Province%20of%20Parma">Province of Parma</a> of northern Italy, the four species "Boletus edulis", "B. aereus", "B. reticulatus" (formerly known as "B. aestivalis"), and "B. pinophilus" have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed "Fungo di Borgotaro". Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries. Throughout Spain, it is one of the wild edible fungi most commonly collected for the table, particularly in <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>, where it is harvested for sale in markets.

When collected, the skin of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. "Boletus aereus" is especially suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or <a href="bamboo%20steamer">bamboo steamer</a> on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.

Based on analyses of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 367 <a href="kilocalorie">kilocalorie</a>s per 100 grams of bolete (as <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>). The <a href="macronutrient">macronutrient</a> composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 17.9 grams of <a href="dietary%20protein">protein</a>, 72.8 grams of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, and 0.4 grams of <a href="dietary%20fat">fat</a>. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 92% water. The predominant <a href="sugar">sugar</a> is <a href="trehalose">trehalose</a> (4.7 grams/100 grams dry weight; all following values assume this mass), with lesser amounts of <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a> (1.3 grams). There are 6 grams of <a href="tocopherol">tocopherol</a>s, the majority of which is <a href="gamma-tocopherol">gamma-tocopherol</a> (<a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a>), and 3.7 grams of <a href="ascorbic%20acid">ascorbic acid</a>.

French battleship Courbet (1911)

Courbet was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Courbet-class%20battleship">her class</a> of four <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, the first ones built for the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>. She was completed shortly before the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914. She helped to sink the <a href="Austro-Hungarian">Austro-Hungarian</a> <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> that same month and spent the war in the Mediterranean. She spent the rest of the war providing cover for the <a href="Otranto%20Barrage">Otranto Barrage</a> that blockaded the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> and often served as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. Although upgraded several times before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, she was not considered to be a first-line battleship by the 1930s and spent much of that decade as a gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>.

A few weeks after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">German invasion of France</a> on 10 May 1940, "Courbet" was hastily reactivated. She supported <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> troops in the defence of <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> during mid-June, taking refuge in England shortly afterwards. As part of <a href="Operation%20Catapult">Operation Catapult</a>, she was seized in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> by British forces on 3 July and was turned over to the <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> a week later. She was used as a stationary <a href="floating%20battery">anti-aircraft battery</a> and as an <a href="accommodation%20ship">accommodation ship</a> there. "Courbet" was disarmed in early 1941 and was used as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> in mid-1943. Her engines and <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s were removed in 1944 to prepare her for use as a <a href="breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> during the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a> (Operation Neptune) in June 1944. She was <a href="scrap">scrap</a>ped where she lay after the war.

By 1909 the French Navy was convinced of the superiority of the <a href="all-big-gun">all-big-gun</a> battleship like over the mixed-calibre designs like the which had preceded the "Courbet"s. The following year, the new <a href="List%20of%20Naval%20Ministers%20of%20France">Minister of the Navy</a>, <a href="Augustin%20Bou%C3%A9%20de%20Lapeyr%C3%A8re">Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère</a>, selected a design that was comparable to the foreign dreadnoughts then under construction to be built as part of the 1906 Naval Programme. The ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a mean <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . They <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. Their crew numbered 1,115 men as a <a href="private%20ship">private ship</a> and increased to 1,187 when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two <a href="Licensed%20production">licence-built</a> <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, each driving two propeller shafts. Unlike her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, "Courbet" had 24 <a href="Field-tube%20boiler%23Niclausse%20boiler">Niclausse boiler</a>s to provide steam for her turbines. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce . The ships had a designed speed of , although "Courbet" only reached during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. The "Courbet"-class ships carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give them a range of at a speed of .
The <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of the "Courbet" class consisted of twelve <a href="305mm/45%20Mod%C3%A8le%201906%20gun">Canon de mle 1906–1910</a> guns mounted in six twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, with two pairs of <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> turrets fore and aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, and a pair of <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s <a href="amidships">amidships</a>. Their <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> was twenty-two <a href="Canon%20de%20138%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201910%20Naval%20gun">Canon de mle 1910</a>, which were mounted singly in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the hull. Four <a href="Canon%20de%2047%20mm%20mod%C3%A8le%201902">Canon de mle 1902</a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s were fitted, two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> in the superstructure. They were also armed with four submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, a pair on each broadside, and could stow 10 <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> below decks. The ships' <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a> ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by of armour and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had thick face and sides.

"Courbet" was ordered on 11 August 1910 and named after <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Am%C3%A9d%C3%A9e%20Courbet">Amédée Courbet</a>. She was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> on 1 September 1910 at the <a href="Arsenal%20de%20Lorient">Arsenal de Lorient</a> and <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 23 September 1911. Shortly after finishing her machinery trials, she ferried the <a href="President%20of%20France">President of France</a>, <a href="Raymond%20Poincar%C3%A9">Raymond Poincaré</a>, to Britain for a short visit on 24–26 June 1913. "Courbet" was completed on 8 October at a cost of <a href="French%20franc">F</a>57,700,000 and was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the fleet on 19 November. "Courbet" and her sister were assigned to the 1st Battle <a href="Division%20%28naval%29">Division</a> () of the 1st Battle Squadron () of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28France%29">1st Naval Army</a> (), at <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> in mid-November and "Courbet" became the flagship of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> () Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, commander of the 1st Battle Squadron, on 5 January 1914.

By the time that France declared war on Germany on 2 August, "Courbet" had been relieved of her assignment to the 1st Division because Boué de Lapeyrère had become commander of the 1st Naval Army and the ship was now the fleet flagship. Since the whereabouts of the German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> were unknown, he split his forces into three groups to cover the movements of troop convoys between <a href="French%20North%20Africa">French North Africa</a> and <a href="metropolitan%20France">metropolitan France</a>. He accompanied the 2nd Battle Squadron (Group B) to <a href="Bougie">Bougie</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, in "Courbet" before rendezvousing with her sisters "Jean Bart" and off <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, to escort them to Toulon because the guns of the former were malfunctioning and the latter was so new that she did not have any ammunition aboard. On 7 August "Courbet" and the battleship took over the escort of a convoy from <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> and then re-coaled in Toulon.

When France declared war on Austria-Hungary on 12 August, Boué de Lapeyrère decided on a <a href="sortie">sortie</a> into the Adriatic intended to force the Austro-Hungarian fleet to give battle. After rendezvousing with a small British force on the 15th, he ordered his forces to split with the battleships headed for <a href="Otranto">Otranto</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, while the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>s patrolled off the <a href="Albania">Albanian</a> coast. Before the two groups got very far apart, several Austro-Hungarian ships were spotted on 16 August and the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> fleet was successful in cutting off and sinking the protected cruiser "Zenta" <a href="Battle%20of%20Antivari">off Antivari</a>, although the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> managed to escape. The following day, Boué de Lapeyrère transferred his flag to "Jean Bart". On 1 September the 1st Naval Army briefly bombarded Austro-Hungarian coastal fortifications defending the <a href="Bay%20of%20Cattaro">Bay of Cattaro</a> to discharge the unfired shells remaining in the guns after sinking "Zenta". Aside from several uneventful sorties into the Adriatic, the French <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s spent most of their time cruising between the Greek and Italian coasts to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The torpedoing of "Jean Bart" on 21 December by the Austro-Hungarian submarine showed that the battleships were too vulnerable to this threat and they were withdrawn to spend the rest of the month further south at an anchorage in <a href="Navarino%20Bay">Navarino Bay</a>. 
On 11 January 1915, the French were alerted that the Austro-Hungarian fleet was going to sortie from its base at <a href="Pula">Pola</a>, so "Courbet", "Paris" and "France" led the Naval Army north to the Albanian coast. It proved to be a false alarm and they were back at their <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">moorings</a> three days later. In the meantime, the ships patrolled the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>. The declaration of war on Austria-Hungary by Italy on 23 May and the Italian decision to assume responsibility for naval operations in the Adriatic, allowed the French Navy to withdraw to either <a href="Malta">Malta</a> or <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a>, <a href="French%20Tunisia">French Tunisia</a>, to cover the Otranto Barrage. At some point during the year, "Courbet"s 47 mm guns were put on high-angle mountings to allow them to be used as <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>. They were later supplemented by a pair of <a href="75mm%2050%20caliber%20Pattern%201892">Mle 1891 G</a> guns on anti-aircraft mounts. On 27 April 1916, the French began using the port of <a href="Argostoli">Argostoli</a> on the Greek island of <a href="Cephalonia">Cephalonia</a> as a base. Around this time many men from the battleships' crews were transferred to anti-submarine ships. At the beginning of 1917, the French began to use the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> as well, but growing shortages of coal severely limited the battleships' ability to go to sea. In 1918 they were almost immobile, leaving Corfu only for maintenance and repairs. On 1 July the Naval Army was reorganised with "Courbet", "Paris" and "Jean Bart" assigned to the 2nd Battle Division of the 1st Battle Squadron. At some point during the year, "Courbet"s mainmast was shortened and a motorised <a href="winch">winch</a> was installed to allow her to operate a <a href="kite%20balloon">kite balloon</a>, but this was not a success.

After the war ended on 11 November, "Courbet" returned to Toulon for a refit; the ship was briefly placed in reserve before she became Vice-Admiral Charlier's flagship between 6 June 1919 and 20 October 1920. On 10 February 1920, the 1st Naval Army was disbanded and replaced by the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron () and its Western counterpart (); all of the "Courbet"s assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the latter unit, with "Courbet", "Jean Bart" and "Paris" in the 1st Battle Division and "France" in the 2nd Battle Division. Charlier commanded both the 1st Division and the Western Mediterranean Squadron at this time. The two squadrons were combined into the Mediterranean Squadron () on 20 July 1921. 

The following year she became a gunnery training ship at Toulon, but she suffered a serious boiler fire on 6 June 1923 that required repairs, so she was given the first of her modernisations between 9 July 1923 and 16 April 1924, at <a href="La%20Seyne-sur-Mer">La Seyne-sur-Mer</a>. This included replacing four boilers with oil-fired <a href="du%20Temple%20boiler">du Temple boiler</a>s and trunking together her two forward <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a>. The maximum elevation of the main armament was increased from 12° to 23° which increased their maximum range to . Her existing AA guns were replaced with four <a href="Canon%20de%2075%20mod%C3%A8le%201897%23Naval%20and%20coastal%20artillery">75 mm Modèle 1918</a> AA guns and her bow armour was removed to make her more seaworthy. A new <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod foremast</a> with a fire-control position at its top was fitted. A <a href="Barr%20%26amp%3B%20Stroud">Barr & Stroud</a> <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was positioned on the roof of the fire-control position and an experimental Barr & Stroud FX2 <a href="coincidence%20rangefinder">coincidence rangefinder</a> was installed on the roof of the aft superfiring turret, replacing the instrument inside the turret. She had another boiler fire on 1 August 1924, burning 13 men, of which 3 later died of their wounds, and remained under repair for the rest of the year.

"Courbet" and the battleship visted Naples, Italy, on 15–19 June 1925 then rendezvoused with "Jean Bart" and "Paris" at <a href="Mers-el-Kebir">Mers-el-Kebir</a>, <a href="French%20Algeria">French Algeria</a>, for manoeuvres in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> with the Atlantic-based ships that began on the 26th. Afterwards, the assembled ships were reviewed by the President of France, <a href="Gaston%20Doumergue">Gaston Doumergue</a> at <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> and the Mediterranean-based ships returned to Toulon on 12 August. On 1 January 1927, the Mediterranean Squadron was renamed the 1st Squadron. Two weeks later "Courbet" began a lengthy modernisation that lasted until 12 January 1931. 

This was much more extensive than her earlier refit as all of her boilers were replaced or <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhauled</a>: she received six oil-fired du Temple boilers that had been built for the scrapped battleship <a href="Normandie-class%20battleship">"Normandie"</a> and sixteen coal-fired boilers from "Normandie"s sister "Flandre". The ship was only able to reach at a displacement of during her sea trials afterwards. "Courbet"s <a href="Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20system">fire-control systems</a> were comprehensively upgraded with the installation of a Saint-Chamond-Granat system in a <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23DCT">director-control tower</a> (DCT) on the top of the tripod mast and all of her original rangefinders were replaced with the exception of the rangefinders in each turret. The DCT was fitted with a 4.57-metre coincidence rangefinder and a stereo rangefinder was added to the DCT to measure the distance between the target and shell splashes. Additional 4.57-metre rangefinders were added in a duplex mounting atop the conning tower and another at the base of the mainmast. The Barr & Stroud 7.6-metre instrument was removed and a traversable rangefinder was fitted to the roof of the forward superfiring turret. Directors with 2-metre rangefinders were also added to control the secondary guns. The ship's Mle 1918 AA guns were exchanged for seven <a href="Canon%20de%2075%20mm%20mod%C3%A8le%201924">Canon de 75 mm modèle 1922</a> guns and they were provided with a pair of high-angle rangefinders, one on top of the duplex unit on the conning tower and one in the aft superstructure.

On 25 March 1931, "Courbet" had a breakdown in one of her turbines and had to return to the shipyard for repairs. After running her sea trials on 9–12 June, she was assigned to the Training Division as part of the gunnery school. The ship conducted several gunnery exercises from 4 February to 27 May 1932 before she returned to the shipyard to have her <a href="Surface%20condenser">condensers</a> retubed and her two inner propellers replaced. In 1933 and 1934, "Courbet" and her sister "Paris", both assigned to the Training Division, rarely left port. "Courbet" had her propulsion machinery overhauled in 1937–1938 and the navy took the opportunity to remove her torpedo tubes and reinforce her anti-aircraft armament with the addition of a few <a href="Hotchkiss%20M1929%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20machinegun">anti-aircraft machinegun</a>s. The Training Squadron was disbanded on 10 June 1939 and the sisters were assigned to the 3rd Battle Division of the 5th Squadron. The ships began a cruise on 14 June during which they visited Mers-el-Kebir and <a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="French%20Morocco">French Morocco</a>, before arriving in <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> on 11 July where the division was assigned to the 2nd Maritime Region which was headquartered there, retaining their role as gunnery training ships.

From the beginning of World War II in September 1939, "Courbet" and "Paris" continued training until after the German invasion of France on 10 May 1940. They were mobilised on 21 May with augmented crews and assigned to the command of Vice-Admiral <a href="Jean-Marie%20Charles%20Abrial">Jean-Marie Abrial</a> for the defence of the French ports on the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. "Courbet" provided gunfire support to the defenders of Cherbourg on 19 June against the advancing <a href="7th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Panzer Division</a> and then covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies during <a href="Operation%20Aerial">Operation Aerial</a>. The ship sailed for <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, the following day.
"Courbet" was seized there, as part of Operation Catapult, by British forces on 3 July to prevent French ships from falling into German hands after their surrender in late June. The ship was turned over to the Free French a week later, who used her as an <a href="floating%20battery">anti-aircraft battery</a> in Portsmouth, until she was disarmed on 31 March 1941, and used as an accommodation ship. At <a href="Loch%20Striven">Loch Striven</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, she was used as a target for the unsuccessful <a href="Bouncing%20bomb">"Highball" bouncing bomb</a> trials on 9–10 May 1943. "Highball" was a smaller version of "Upkeep" used in the <a href="Operation%20Chastise">Operation Chastise</a>, also known as the Dambuster Raid. "Courbet" remained in use as a depot and target ship until she was earmarked for use as a <a href="Mulberry%20harbour">"Gooseberry" breakwater</a> at <a href="Sword%20Beach">Sword Beach</a> during the Normandy landings. The ship had to be towed from <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> on 7 June by a pair of British tugboats as her engines and boilers had been removed earlier and replaced with concrete. She was <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> on 9 June off Sword Beach and was hit by <a href="Neger">Neger</a> <a href="manned%20torpedo">manned torpedo</a>es during the nights of 15–16 and 16–17 August. She was slowly scrapped in place after the war, the demolition not being completed until 1970.

Mozambican War of Independence

The Mozambican War of Independence was an <a href="armed%20conflict">armed conflict</a> between the <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> forces of the <a href="Mozambique%20Liberation%20Front">Mozambique Liberation Front</a> or FRELIMO (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique), and <a href="Portuguese%20Armed%20Forces">Portugal</a>. The war officially started on September 25, 1964, and ended with a <a href="ceasefire">ceasefire</a> on September 8, 1974, resulting in a negotiated independence in 1975.

Portugal's wars against independence guerrilla fighters in its <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">400-year-old African territories</a> began <a href="Angolan%20War%20of%20Independence">in 1961 with Angola</a>. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 as a result of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous <a href="Mozambique">Mozambican</a> populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.

As successful <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a> movements spread throughout Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively <a href="Nationalism">nationalistic</a> in outlook, and increasingly frustrated by the nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many <a href="enculturate">enculturate</a>d indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a>, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims with a mixture of discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.

A mass exile of Mozambique's political <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> to neighbouring countries provided havens from which radical Mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland. The formation of the Mozambican guerrilla organisation <a href="Mozambican%20Liberation%20Front">FRELIMO</a> and the support of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a> <a href="History%20of%20Libya%20under%20Muammar%20Gaddafi">regime</a> in <a href="Libya">Libya</a> through arms and advisers, led to the outbreak of violence that was to last over a decade.

From a military standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held the upper hand during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> backed by portions of the military in Portugal overthrow the <a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29">military dictatorship</a> sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the <a href="Portuguese%20Colonial%20War">Portuguese Colonial War</a> in general, were main causes for the final outcome.

<a href="Bushmen">San</a> hunter and gatherers, ancestors of the <a href="Khoisani">Khoisani</a> peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu</a>-speaking peoples who migrated there across the <a href="Zambezi%20River">Zambezi River</a>. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as <a href="Portuguese%20East%20Africa">Portuguese East Africa</a>. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers and there was no centralised administration.
By the 19th century, African colonialism in Africa had reached its height. Having lost control of the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portugese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a> had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.

As a result, in an attempt to avoid a naval conflict with the superior British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the <a href="Niassa%20Company">Niassa Company</a> which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> to work mines and construct railways.

The resisting <a href="Gaza%20Empire">Gaza Empire</a>, a collection of indigenous tribes who inhabited the area that now constitutes Mozambique and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, was defeated in 1895, and the remaining inland tribes were eventually defeated by 1902; in that same year, Portugal established <a href="Maputo">Lourenço Marques</a> as the capital. In 1926, political and economic crisis in Portugal led to the establishment of the Second Republic (later to become the <a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29">Estado Novo</a>), and a revival of interest in the African colonies. Calls for <a href="self%20determination">self determination</a> in Mozambique arose shortly after World War II, in light of the independence granted to many other colonies worldwide in the great wave of <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a>.

Portugal designated Mozambique an <a href="overseas%20administrative%20territorial%20entity">overseas territory</a> in 1951 in order to show to the world that the colony had a greater autonomy. It was called the <a href="Overseas%20Province%20of%20Mozambique">Overseas Province of Mozambique</a> ("Província Ultramarina de Moçambique"). Nonetheless, Portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province. The increasing number of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population, encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within Mozambique.

Mozambique was marked by large disparities between the wealthy Portuguese and the majority of the large rural indigenous African population. Poorer whites, many of them recent immigrants, including illiterate peasants, were given preference in lower-level urban jobs, where a system of job reservation existed. In the rural areas, Portuguese controlled the trading stores with which African peasants interacted. Being largely <a href="illiteracy">illiterate</a> and preserving their local traditions and ways of life, skilled employment opportunities and roles in administration and government were rare for these numerous <a href="tribe">tribal</a> populations, leaving them few or no opportunities in the urban modern life. Many indigenous peoples saw their culture and tradition being overwhelmed by the alien culture of Portugal. A small educated African class did emerge, but faced substantial discrimination.

Vocal political dissidents opposed to Portuguese rule and claiming <a href="independence">independence</a> were typically forced into exile. From the mid-1920s a succession of authoritarian regimes in Portugal closed unions and left-wing opposition, both within Portugal and within its colonies, notably in the Estado Novo period (1933–1974). 
The Portuguese government forced black Mozambican farmers to grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return with which the farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were pressured to work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted the right to vote by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and Mozambican locals is illustrated in one way by the small number of people with mixed Portuguese and Mozambican heritage ("mestiço"), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.

The <a href="Mozambique%20Liberation%20Front">Mozambique Liberation Front</a> or FRELIMO ("Frente de Libertação de Moçambique"), formally (<a href="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> as of 1977 but adherent to such positions since the late 1960s,) was formed in <a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a>, the largest city in neighbouring <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, on June 25, 1962, under the leadership of sociologist <a href="Eduardo%20Mondlane">Eduardo Mondlane</a>. It was created during a conference, by political figures who had been forced into exile, by the merging of various existing nationalist groups, including the Mozambican African National Union, National African Union of Independent Mozambique and the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Mozambique">National Democratic Union of Mozambique</a> which had been formed two years earlier. It was only in exile that such political movements could develop, due to the strength of Portugal's grip on dissident activity within Mozambique itself.

The United Nations also put pressure on Portugal to move for decolonisation. Portugal threatened to withdraw from <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, which put a stop to this support and pressure, and the nationalist groups in Mozambique were forced to turn to help from the Soviet bloc.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, and particularly in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken the West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.

Prior to the formation of FRELIMO, the Soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in Mozambique was one of confusion. There were multiple independence movements, and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed. The nationalist groups in Mozambique, like those across Africa during the period, received training and equipment from the Soviet Union.

Eduardo Mondlane's successor, future <a href="Heads%20of%20state%20of%20Mozambique">President of Mozambique</a>, <a href="Samora%20Machel">Samora Machel</a>, acknowledged assistance from both Moscow and Peking, describing them as "the only ones who will really help us. ... They have fought armed struggles, and whatever they have learned that is relevant to Mozambique we will use." Guerrillas received tuition in subversion and political warfare as well as military aid, specifically shipments of 122 mm artillery rockets in 1972, with 1600 advisors from Russia, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>. FRELIMO adopted Marxism-Leninism at an early stage.

The Soviet Union continued to support the new FRELIMO government against <a href="counterrevolutionary">counterrevolution</a> in the years after 1975. By 1981, there were 230 Soviet, close to 200 <a href="Military%20of%20Cuba">Cuban military</a> and over 600 civilian Cuban advisers still in the country. Cuba's involvement in Mozambique was as part of a continuing effort to export the anti-imperialist ideology of the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a> and forge desperately needed new allies. Cuba provided support to liberation movements and leftist governments in numerous African countries, including <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, Ethiopia, <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a> and <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congo-Brazzaville</a>.

At the war's outset, FRELIMO had little hope for a conventional military victory, with a mere 7,000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. Portugal fought its own version of protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967.

The military wing of FRELIMO was commanded by <a href="Filipe%20Samuel%20Magaia">Filipe Samuel Magaia</a>, whose forces received training from <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. The FRELIMO guerrillas were armed with a variety of weapons, many provided by the Soviet Union and China. Common weapons included the <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> bolt-action rifle, <a href="SKS">SKS</a> and <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a> automatic rifles and the Soviet <a href="PPSh-41">PPSh-41</a>. Machine guns such as the <a href="Degtyarev%20light%20machine%20gun">Degtyarev light machine gun</a> were widely used, along with the <a href="DShK">DShK</a> and the <a href="SG-43%20Gorunov">SG-43 Gorunov</a>. FRELIMO were supported by mortars, <a href="recoilless%20rifle">recoilless rifle</a>s, <a href="RPG-2">RPG-2</a>s and <a href="RPG-7">RPG-7</a>s, <a href="Anti-aircraft%20weapons">Anti-aircraft weapons</a> such as the <a href="ZPU-4">ZPU-4</a> and from 1974 the <a href="Strela%202">Strela 2</a>.

In the dying stages of the conflict, FRELIMO was provided with a few <a href="Strela%202">SA-7</a> <a href="Shoulder-fired%20missile">MANPAD</a> <a href="Shoulder-launched%20missile%20weapon">shoulder-launched missile launchers</a> from China; these were never used to shoot down a Portuguese plane. Only one Portuguese aircraft was lost in combat during the conflict, when Lt. Emilio Lourenço's <a href="Aeritalia%20G.91">G.91R-4</a> was destroyed by premature detonation of his own ordnance.

The Portuguese forces were under the command of General António Augusto dos Santos, a man with strong faith in new counter-insurgency theories. Augusto dos Santos supported a collaboration with <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> to create African Scout units and other special forces teams, with Rhodesian forces even conducting their own independent operations during the conflict. Due to Portuguese policy of retaining up-to-date equipment for the <a href="metropole">metropole</a> while shipping obsolete equipment to their overseas territoires, the Portuguese soldiers fighting in the opening stages of the conflict were equipped with World War II radios and the old <a href="Mauser%20rifle">Mauser rifle</a>. As the fighting progressed, the need for more modern equipment was rapidly recognised, and the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20G3">Heckler & Koch G3</a> and <a href="FN%20FAL">FN FAL</a> rifles were adopted as the standard battlefield weapon, along with the <a href="AR-10">AR-10</a> for paratroopers. The <a href="MG42">MG42</a> and, then in 1968, the <a href="HK21">HK21</a> were the Portuguese general purpose machine guns, with 60, 81 and 120 mm mortars, howitzers and the <a href="Panhard%20AML">AML-60</a>, <a href="Panhard%20EBR">Panhard EBR</a>, <a href="Fox%20Armoured%20Reconnaissance%20Vehicle">Fox</a> and <a href="Bravia%20Chaimite">Chaimite</a> armoured cars frequently deployed for fire support.

In 1964, attempts at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical assistance from the local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai in the province of <a href="Cabo%20Delgado%20Province">Cabo Delgado</a>. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> season in order to evade pursuit.

During heavy rains, it was much more difficult to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the "mato") amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.

With the initial FRELIMO attacks in Chai Chai, the fighting spread to <a href="Niassa">Niassa</a> and <a href="Tete">Tete</a> at the centre of Mozambique. During the early stages of the conflict, FRELIMO activity was reduced to small, platoon-sized engagements, harassments and raids on Portuguese installations. The FRELIMO forces often operated in small groups of ten to fifteen cadres. The scattered nature of FRELIMO's initial attacks was an attempt to disperse the Portuguese forces.

The Portuguese troops began to suffer losses in November, fighting in the northern region of Xilama. With increasing support from the populace, and the low number of Portuguese regular troops, FRELIMO was quickly able to advance south towards Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete with the aid of forces from the neighbouring <a href="Republic%20of%20Malawi">Republic of Malawi</a>, which had become a fully independent member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> on the 6 July 1964. Despite the increasing range of FRELIMO operations, attacks were still limited to small strike teams attacking lightly defended administrative outposts, with the FRELIMO lines of communication and supply utilising canoes along the <a href="Ruvuma%20River">Ruvuma River</a> and <a href="Lake%20Malawi">Lake Malawi</a>.
It was not until 1965 that recruitment of fighters increased along with popular support, and the strike teams were able to increase in size. The increase in popular support was in part due to FRELIMO agencies' offer of help to exiled Mozambicans, who had fled the conflict by travelling to nearby Tanzania. Like similar conflicts against the French and <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States forces</a> in Vietnam, the insurgents also used <a href="landmine">landmine</a>s to a great extent to injure the Portuguese forces, thus straining the armed forces' infrastructure and demoralising soldiers.

FRELIMO attack groups had also begun to grow in size to include over 100 soldiers in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks. On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after inspecting the front lines, Filipe Samuel Magaia was shot dead by Lourenço Matola, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who was said to be in the employ of the Portuguese.

One seventh of the population and one fifth of the territory were in FRELIMO hands by 1967; at this time there were approximately 8000 <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a>s in combat. During this period, Mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort, but also sought to retain the small strike groups. With the increasing cost of supply, more and more territory liberated from the Portuguese, and the adoption of measures to win the support of the population, it was at this time that Mondlane sought assistance from abroad, specifically the Soviet Union and China; from these benefactors, he obtained large-calibre machine guns, anti-aircraft rifles and 75 mm recoilless rifles and 122 mm rockets.

In 1968, the second Congress of FRELIMO was a propaganda victory for the insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb the location of the meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.

Due to both the technological gap between civilisations and <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">the centuries-long colonial era</a>, Portugal was a driving force in the development and shaping of all <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Africa</a> since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a> by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.

As part of this redevelopment program, construction of the <a href="Cahora%20Bassa%20Dam">Cahora Bassa Dam</a> began in 1969. This particular project became intrinsically linked with Portugal's concerns over security in the overseas territories. The Portuguese government viewed the construction of the dam as testimony to Portugal's "<a href="civilising%20mission">civilising mission</a>" and intended for the dam to reaffirm Mozambican belief in the strength and security of the Portuguese overseas government. To this end, Portugal sent three thousand new troops and over one million landmines to Mozambique to defend the building project.

Realising the symbolic significance of the dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys "en route" to the site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda value to the Portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse Mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods, which formerly re-fertilised the plantations.

On February 3, 1969, <a href="Eduardo%20Mondlane">Eduardo Mondlane</a> was killed by explosives smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, in an attempt to rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.

The original investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who was later executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter had made no secret of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him as too conservative a leader, and the Tanzanian police also accused him of working with <a href="PIDE">PIDE</a> (Portugal's <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a>) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.

Although the exact details of the assassination remain disputed, the involvement of the Portuguese government, particularly <a href="Aginter%20Press">Aginter Press</a> or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese <a href="stay%20behind">stay behind</a> <a href="Operation%20Gladio">Gladio-esque</a> army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the <a href="Left%20wing%20politics">political left</a>.

In 1969, General António Augusto dos Santos was relieved of command, with General <a href="Ka%C3%BAlza%20de%20Arriaga">Kaúlza de Arriaga</a> taking over officially in March 1970. Kaúlza de Arriaga favoured a more direct method of fighting the insurgents, and the established policy of using African counter-insurgency forces was rejected in favour of the deployment of regular Portuguese forces accompanied by a small number of African fighters. Indigenous personnel were still recruited for special operations, such as the Special Groups of Parachutists in 1973, though their role less significant under the new commander. His tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with United States General <a href="William%20Westmoreland">William Westmoreland</a>.

By 1972 there was growing pressure from other commanders, particularly Kaúlza de Arriaga's second in command, General <a href="Francisco%20da%20Costa%20Gomes">Francisco da Costa Gomes</a>, for the use of African soldiers in "<a href="Flechas">Flechas</a>" units. Flechas units ("Arrows") were also employed in Angola and were units under the command of the Portuguese <a href="PIDE">PIDE</a>. Composed of local tribesmen, the units specialised in tracking, reconnaissance and anti-terrorist operations.

Costa Gomes argued that African soldiers were cheaper and were better able to create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the '<a href="Hearts%20and%20Minds%20%28Vietnam%29">hearts and minds</a>' strategy being used by <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States forces</a> in <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a> at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of <a href="Ka%C3%BAlza%20de%20Arriaga">Kaúlza de Arriaga</a> on the eve of the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Portuguese coup</a> in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into <a href="Mozambican%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>.
During the entire period of 1970–74, FRELIMO intensified guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating that they had become responsible for two out of every three Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO used a variety of <a href="Anti-tank%20mine">anti-tank</a> and <a href="Anti-personnel%20mine">anti-personnel</a> mines, including the <a href="PMN%20mine">PMN (Black Widow)</a>, <a href="TM-46%20mine">TM-46</a>, and <a href="POMZ">POMZ</a>. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the <a href="PDM%20series%20of%20amphibious%20mines">PDM</a>. <a href="Mine%20psychosis">Mine psychosis</a>, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces. This fear, coupled with the frustration of taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces, damaged morale and significantly hampered progress.

On June 10, 1970, a major counter-offensive was launched by the Portuguese army. Operation Gordian Knot (Portuguese: Operação Nó Górdio) targeted permanent insurgent camps and the infiltration routes across the Tanzanian border in the north of Mozambique over a period of seven months. The operation involved some 35,000 Portuguese troops, particularly elite units like paratroopers, commandos, marines and naval fusiliers.
Problems for the Portuguese arose almost immediately when the offensive coincided with the beginning of the monsoon season, creating additional logistical difficulties. Not only were the Portuguese soldiers badly equipped, but there was very poor cooperation, if any at all, between the FAP and the army. Thus, the army lacked close air support from the FAP. Mounting Portuguese casualties began to outweigh FRELIMO casualties, leading to further political intervention from Lisbon.

The Portuguese eventually reported 651 guerrillas as killed (a figure of some 440 was most likely closer to reality), and 1,840 captured, for the loss of 132 Portuguese soldiers. General Arriaga also claimed his troops destroyed 61 guerrilla bases and 165 guerrilla camps, while 40 tons of ammunition had been captured in the first two months. Although "Gordian Knot" was the most effective Portuguese offensive of the conflict, weakening guerrillas to such a degree that they were no longer a significant threat, the operation was deemed a failure by some military officers and the government.

On December 16, 1972, the Portuguese 6th company of Commandos in Mozambique killed the inhabitants of the village of Wiriyamu, in the district of <a href="Tete">Tete</a>. Referred to as the 'Wiriyamu Massacre', the soldiers killed between 150 (according to the Red Cross) and 300 (according to a much later investigation by the Portuguese newspaper "<a href="Expresso%20%28Portuguese%20newspaper%29">Expresso</a>" based in testimonies from soldiers) villagers accused of sheltering FRELIMO guerrillas. The action, "Operation Marosca", was planned at the instigation of <a href="PIDE/DGS">PIDE/DGS</a> agents and guided by agent Chico Kachavi, who was later assassinated while an inquiry into the events was being carried out. The soldiers were told by this agent that "the orders were to kill them all", never mind that only civilians, women and children included, were found. All of the victims were civilians. The massacre was recounted in July 1973 by the British Catholic priest, Father <a href="Adrian%20Hastings">Adrian Hastings</a>, and two other Spanish missionary priests. Later counter-claims have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam <a href="Laurean%20Rugambwa">Laurean Rugambwa</a> that alleged that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces. In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad. Portuguese journalist Felícia Cabrita reconstructed the Wiriyamu massacre in detail by interviewing both survivors and former members of the <a href="Portuguese%20Army%20Commandos">Portuguese Army Commandos</a> unit that carried out the massacre. Cabrita's report was published in the Portuguese weekly newspaper "Expresso" and later in a book containing several of the journalist's articles. On July 16, 1973, Zambia condemned the alleged massacres carried out by Portuguese troops.

By 1973, FRELIMO were also mining civilian towns and villages in an attempt to undermine the civilian confidence in the Portuguese forces. "Aldeamentos: agua para todos" (Resettlement villages: water for everyone) was a commonly seen message in the rural areas, as the Portuguese sought to relocate and resettle the indigenous population, in order to isolate the FRELIMO from its civilian base. Conversely, Mondlane's policy of mercy towards civilian Portuguese settlers was abandoned in 1973 by the new commander, Machel. "Panic, demoralisation, abandonment, and a sense of futility – all were reactions among whites in Mozambique" stated conflict historian T. H. Henricksen in 1983.

This change in tactic led to protests by Portuguese settlers against the Lisbon government, a telltale sign of the conflict's unpopularity. Combined with the news of the <a href="Wiriyamu%20Massacre">Wiriyamu Massacre</a> and that of renewed FRELIMO onslaughts through 1973 and early 1974, the worsening situation in Mozambique later contributed to the downfall of the Portuguese government in 1974. A Portuguese journalist argued:

Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' branch of the <a href="Portuguese%20Communist%20Party">Portuguese Communist Party</a>, which was created in the late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out multiple sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the <a href="Tancos">Tancos</a> air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> headquarters at <a href="Oeiras%20Municipality%2C%20Portugal">Oeiras</a> in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship "Niassa" illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. "Niassa" (named after <a href="Niassa">a Mozambican province</a>) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.
Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies had absorbed forty-four percent of the overall Portuguese budget, which led to a diversion of funds from infrastructural developments in Portugal, contributing to the growing unrest in the European nation. The unpopularity of the Colonial Wars among many Portuguese led to the formation of magazines and newspapers, such as "Cadernos Circunstância", "Cadernos Necessários", "Tempo e Modo", and "Polémica", which had support from students and called for political solutions to Portugal's colonial problems. Dissatisfaction in Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a>, a peaceful leftist military "coup d'état" in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of <a href="Marcelo%20Caetano">Marcelo Caetano</a>. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, and the new head of government, General <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Sp%C3%ADnola">António de Spínola</a>, called for a <a href="ceasefire">ceasefire</a>. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the <a href="Lusaka%20Accord">Lusaka Accord</a> signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.

Many Portuguese colonials were not typical settlers in <a href="Portuguese%20East%20Africa">Mozambique</a>. While most European communities in Africa at the time – with the possible exception of <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>s – were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. About 300,000 white civilians left Mozambique in the first week or two of independence (in Europe they were popularly known as "<a href="retornados">retornados</a>"). <a href="Samora%20Machel">Samora Machel</a> became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend <a href="Uria%20Simango">Uria Simango</a>, his wife, and other FRELIMO dissidents were arrested in 1975 and detained without trial.

With the departure of Portuguese professionals and tradesmen, Mozambique lacked an educated workforce to maintain its infrastructure, and economic collapse loomed. Advisors from communist countries were brought in by the FRELIMO regime. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the <a href="Mozambican%20Civil%20War">Mozambican Civil War</a> against <a href="RENAMO">RENAMO</a> insurgents plied with <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>n and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n military support. Industrial and social <a href="recession">recession</a>, <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>-style <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, corruption, poverty, <a href="Economic%20inequality">inequality</a> and failed <a href="central%20planning">central planning</a> eroded the initial revolutionary fervour.

Siege of Constantinople (674–678)

The First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 674–678 was a major conflict of the <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars">Arab–Byzantine wars</a>, and the first culmination of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>'s expansionist strategy towards the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, led by Caliph <a href="Mu%27awiya%20I">Mu'awiya I</a>. Mu'awiya, who had emerged in 661 as the ruler of the Muslim Arab empire following a <a href="First%20Fitna">civil war</a>, renewed aggressive warfare against Byzantium after a lapse of some years and hoped to deliver a lethal blow by capturing the Byzantine capital, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

As reported by the Byzantine chronicler <a href="Theophanes%20the%20Confessor">Theophanes the Confessor</a>, the Arab attack was methodical: in 672–673 Arab fleets secured bases along the coasts of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and then proceeded to install a loose blockade around Constantinople. They used the peninsula of <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> near the city as a base to spend the winter, and returned every spring to launch attacks against the <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">city's fortifications</a>. Finally, the Byzantines, under Emperor <a href="Constantine%20IV">Constantine IV</a>, managed to destroy the Arab navy using a new invention, the liquid incendiary substance known as <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>. The Byzantines also defeated the Arab land army in Asia Minor, forcing them to lift the siege. The Byzantine victory was of major importance for the survival of the Byzantine state, as the Arab threat receded for a time. A peace treaty was signed soon after, and following the outbreak of <a href="Second%20Fitna">another Muslim civil war</a>, the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate.

The siege left several traces in the legends of the nascent Muslim world, although it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph <a href="Yazid%20I">Yazid I</a>. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account was questioned in 2010 by Oxford scholar James Howard-Johnston, who placed more emphasis on the Arabic and <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> sources. On the other hand, echoes of a large siege of Constantinople and a subsequent peace treaty reached <a href="China">China</a>, where they were recorded in later histories of the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a>.

Following the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Yarmouk">Battle of Yarmouk</a> in 636, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> withdrew the bulk of its remaining forces from the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> into <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, which was shielded from the Muslim expansion by the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>. This left the field open for the warriors of the nascent <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a> to complete their <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Syria">conquest</a> of <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syria</a>, with <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> too <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">falling</a> shortly after. Muslim raids against the <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>n frontier zone and deep into Asia Minor began as early as 640, and continued under <a href="Mu%27awiya%20I">Mu'awiya</a>, then governor of the Levant. Mu'awiya also spearheaded the development of a Muslim navy, which within a few years grew sufficiently strong to occupy <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and raid as far as <a href="Kos">Kos</a>, <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> and <a href="Crete">Crete</a> in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Finally, the young Muslim navy scored a crushing victory over its <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine counterpart</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Phoenix">Battle of Phoenix</a> in 655. Following the murder of Caliph <a href="Uthman">Uthman</a> and the outbreak of the <a href="First%20Fitna">First Muslim Civil War</a>, Arab attacks against Byzantium stopped. In 659, Mu'awiya even concluded a truce with Byzantium, including payment of tribute to the Empire.

The peace lasted until the end of the Muslim civil war in 661, from which Mu'awiya and his clan emerged victorious, establishing the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>. From the next year, Muslim attacks recommenced, with pressure mounting as Muslim armies began wintering on Byzantine soil west of the Taurus range, maximizing the disruption caused to the Byzantine economy. These land expeditions were sometimes coupled with naval raids against the coasts of southern Asia Minor. In 668, the Arabs sent aid to <a href="Saborios">Saborios</a>, "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" of the <a href="Armeniac%20Theme">Armeniac Theme</a>, who had rebelled and proclaimed himself emperor. The Arab troops under <a href="Fadhala%20ibn%20%27Ubayd">Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd</a> arrived too late to assist Saborios, who had died after falling from his horse, and they spent the winter in the <a href="Armenian%20Hexapolis">Hexapolis</a> around <a href="Melitene">Melitene</a> awaiting reinforcements.

In spring 669, after receiving additional troops, Fadhala entered Asia Minor and advanced as far as <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a>, on the Asian shore of the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> across from the Byzantine capital, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. The Arab attacks on Chalcedon were repelled, and the Arab army was decimated by famine and disease. Mu'awiya dispatched another army, led by his son (and future Caliph) <a href="Yazid%20I">Yazid</a>, to Fadhala's aid. Accounts of what followed differ. The Byzantine chronicler <a href="Theophanes%20the%20Confessor">Theophanes the Confessor</a> reports that the Arabs remained before Chalcedon for a while before returning to Syria, and that on their way they captured and garrisoned <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>. This was the first time the Arabs tried to hold a captured fortress in the interior of Asia Minor beyond the campaigning season, and probably meant that the Arabs intended to return next year and use the town as their base, but Amorium was retaken by the Byzantines during the subsequent winter. Arab sources on the other hand report that the Muslims crossed over into Europe and launched an unsuccessful attack on Constantinople itself, before returning to Syria. Given the lack of any mention of such an assault in Byzantine sources, it is most probable that the Arab chroniclers—taking account of Yazid's presence and the fact that Chalcedon is a suburb of Constantinople—"upgraded" the attack on Chalcedon to an attack on the Byzantine capital itself.

The campaign of 669 clearly demonstrated to the Arabs the possibility of a direct strike at Constantinople, as well as the necessity of having a supply base in the region. This was found in the peninsula of <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> on the southern shore of the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, where a raiding fleet under Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd wintered in 670 or 671. Mu'awiya now began preparing his final assault on the Byzantine capital. In contrast to Yazid's expedition, Mu'awiya intended to take a coastal route to Constantinople. The undertaking followed a careful, phased approach: first the Muslims had to secure strongpoints and bases along the coast, and then, with Cyzicus as a base, Constantinople would be blockaded by land and sea and cut off from the agrarian hinterland that supplied its food.
Accordingly, in 672 three great Muslim fleets were dispatched to secure the sea lanes and establish bases between Syria and the Aegean. Muhammad ibn Abdallah's fleet wintered at <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, a fleet under a certain Qays (perhaps <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Qays">Abdallah ibn Qays</a>) wintered in <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a> and Cilicia, and a third fleet, under Khalid, joined them later. According to the report of Theophanes, the Emperor <a href="Constantine%20IV">Constantine IV</a> (), upon learning of the Arab fleets' approach, began equipping his own fleet for war. Constantine's armament included siphon-bearing ships intended for the deployment of a newly developed incendiary substance, <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>. In 673, another Arab fleet, under <a href="Gunada%20ibn%20Abu%20Umayya">Gunada ibn Abu Umayya</a>, captured <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a> in Cilicia, as well as Rhodes. The latter, midway between Syria and Constantinople, was converted into a forward supply base and centre for Muslim naval raids. Its garrison of 12,000 men was regularly rotated back to Syria, a small fleet was attached to it for defence and raiding, and the Arabs even sowed wheat and brought along animals to graze on the island. The Byzantines attempted to obstruct the Arab plans with a naval attack on Egypt, but it was unsuccessful. Throughout this period, overland raids into Asia Minor continued, and the Arab troops wintered on Byzantine soil.

In 674, the Arab fleet sailed from its bases in the eastern Aegean and entered the Sea of Marmara. According to the account of Theophanes, they landed on the <a href="Thrace">Thracian</a> shore near <a href="Hebdomon">Hebdomon</a> in April, and until September were engaged in constant clashes with the Byzantine troops. As the Byzantine chronicler reports, "Every day there was a military engagement from morning until evening, between the outworks of the <a href="Golden%20Gate%20%28Constantinople%29">Golden Gate</a> and the <a href="Kyklobion">Kyklobion</a>, with thrust and counter-thrust". Then the Arabs departed and made for Cyzicus, which they captured and converted into a fortified camp to spend the winter. This set the pattern that continued throughout the siege: each spring, the Arabs crossed the Marmara and assaulted Constantinople, withdrawing to Cyzicus for the winter. In fact, the "siege" of Constantinople was a series of engagements around the city, which may even be stretched to include Yazid's 669 attack. Both Byzantine and Arab chroniclers record the siege as lasting for seven years instead of five. This can be reconciled either by including the opening campaigns of 672–673, or by counting the years until the final withdrawal of the Arab troops from their forward bases, in 680.

The details of the clashes around Constantinople are unclear, as Theophanes condenses the siege in his account of the first year, and the Arab chroniclers do not mention the siege at all but merely provide the names of leaders of unspecified expeditions into Byzantine territory. Thus from the Arab sources it is only known that Abdallah ibn Qays and Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd raided Crete and wintered there in 675, while in the same year Malik ibn Abdallah led a raid into Asia Minor. The Arab historians <a href="Ibn%20Wadih">Ibn Wadih</a> and <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a> report that Yazid was dispatched by Mu'awiya with reinforcements to Constantinople in 676, and record that Abdallah ibn Qays led a campaign in 677, the target of which is unknown. 

At the same time, the preoccupation with the Arab threat had reduced Byzantium's ability to respond to threats elsewhere: in Italy, the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> used the opportunity to conquer most of <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>, including <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a> and <a href="Brundisium">Brundisium</a>, while in the Balkans, a coalition of Slavic tribes <a href="Siege%20of%20Thessalonica%20%28676%E2%80%93678%29">attacked</a> the city of <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> and launched seaborne raids in the Aegean, even penetrating into the Sea of Marmara. 

Finally, in autumn 677 or early 678 Constantine IV resolved to confront the Arab besiegers in a head-on engagement. His fleet, equipped with Greek fire, routed the Arab fleet. It is probable that the death of admiral Yazid ibn Shagara, reported by Arab chroniclers for 677/678, is related to this defeat. At about the same time, the Muslim army in Asia Minor, under the command of <a href="Sufyan%20ibn%20%27Awf">Sufyan ibn 'Awf</a>, was defeated by the Byzantine army under the generals Phloros, Petron and Cyprian, losing 30,000 men according to Theophanes. These defeats forced the Arabs to abandon the siege in 678. On its way back to Syria, the Arab fleet was almost annihilated in a storm off <a href="Syllaion">Syllaion</a>.

The essential outline of Theophanes' account may be corroborated by the only near-contemporary Byzantine reference to the siege, a celebratory poem by the otherwise unknown Theodosius Grammaticus, which was earlier believed to refer to the second Arab siege of 717–718. Theodosius' poem commemorates a decisive naval victory before the walls of the city—with the interesting detail that the Arab fleet too possessed fire-throwing ships—and makes a reference to "the fear of their returning shadows", which may be interpreted as confirming the recurring Arab attacks each spring from their base in Cyzicus.

Constantinople was the nerve centre of the Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's remaining provinces would have been unlikely to hold together, and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, the failure of the Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation of a huge fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's prestige. Conversely, Byzantine prestige reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a> and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.

The failure of the Arabs before Constantinople coincided with the increased activity of the <a href="Mardaites">Mardaites</a>, a Christian group living in the mountains of Syria that resisted Muslim control and raided the lowlands. Faced with this new threat, and after the immense losses suffered against the Byzantines, Mu'awiya began negotiations for a truce, with embassies exchanged between the two courts. These were drawn out until 679, giving the Arabs time for a last raid into Asia Minor under 'Amr ibn Murra, perhaps intended to put pressure on the Byzantines. The peace treaty, of a nominal 30-year duration, provided that the Caliph would pay an annual tribute of 3,000 "<a href="solidus%20%28coin%29">nomismata</a>", 50 horses and 50 slaves. The Arab garrisons were withdrawn from their bases on the Byzantine coastlands, including Rhodes, in 679–680. 

Soon after the Arab retreat from his capital, Constantine IV quickly sent an expedition against the Slavs in the area of Thessalonica, curtailing their piracy, relieving the city and restoring imperial control over the city's surroundings. Following the conclusion of peace, he moved against the mounting <a href="Bulgars">Bulgar</a> menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising all the available forces of the Empire, was <a href="Battle%20of%20Ongal">decisively beaten</a>, opening the way for the establishment of a <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgar state</a> in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this <a href="Second%20Fitna">Second Muslim Civil War</a> allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. <a href="Medieval%20Armenia">Armenia</a> and <a href="Principality%20of%20Iberia">Iberia</a> reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a <a href="Condominium_%28international_law%29">condominium</a> between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Constantine IV's son and successor, <a href="Justinian%20II">Justinian II</a> (), broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were <a href="Battle%20of%20Sebastopolis">defeated</a>, Justinian was deposed and a <a href="Twenty%20Years%27%20Anarchy">twenty-year period of anarchy</a> followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28717%E2%80%9318%29">second Arab attempt</a> at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.

Later Arab sources dwell extensively on the events of Yazid's 669 expedition and supposed attack on Constantinople, including various mythical anecdotes, which are taken by modern scholarship to refer to the events of the 674–678 siege. Several important personalities of early Islam are mentioned as taking part, such as <a href="Ibn%20Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Umar">Ibn Umar</a> and <a href="Ibn%20al-Zubayr">Ibn al-Zubayr</a>. The most prominent among them in later tradition is <a href="Abu%20Ayyub%20al-Ansari">Abu Ayyub al-Ansari</a>, one of the early companions ("<a href="Ansar%20%28Islam%29">Anṣār</a>") and standard-bearer of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, who died of illness before the <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">city walls</a> during the siege and was buried there. According to Muslim tradition, Constantine IV threatened to destroy his tomb, but the Caliph warned that if he did so, the Christians under Muslim rule would suffer. Thus the tomb was left in peace, and even became a site of veneration by the Byzantines, who prayed there in times of drought. The tomb was "rediscovered" after the <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople</a> to the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> in 1453 by the <a href="dervish">dervish</a> Sheikh <a href="Ak%20Shams%20al-Din">Ak Shams al-Din</a>, and Sultan <a href="Mehmed%20II">Mehmed II</a> () ordered the construction of a marble tomb and a <a href="Ey%C3%BCp%20Sultan%20Mosque">mosque</a> adjacent to it. It became a tradition that Ottoman sultans were girt with the <a href="Sword%20of%20Osman">Sword of Osman</a> at the Eyüp mosque upon their accession. Today it remains one of the holiest Muslim shrines in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.

This siege in the <a href="Twenty-four%20Histories">Chinese dynastic histories</a> of the "<a href="Old%20Book%20of%20Tang">Old Book of Tang</a>" and "<a href="New%20Book%20of%20Tang">New Book of Tang</a>". They record that the large, well-fortified capital city of <a href="Sino-Roman%20relations">"Fu lin"</a> (拂菻; i.e. Byzantium) was besieged by the "Da shi" (大食, i.e. the Umayyad Arabs) and their commander "Mo-yi" (<a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>: 摩拽伐之, <a href="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>: "Mó zhuāi fá zhī"), who <a href="Friedrich%20Hirth">Friedrich Hirth</a> has identified as Mu'awiya. The Chinese histories then explain that the Arabs forced the Byzantines to pay tribute afterwards as part of a peace settlement. In these Chinese sources, "Fu lin" was directly related to the earlier "<a href="Daqin">Daqin</a>", which is now considered by modern <a href="Sinology">sinologists</a> as the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. <a href="Henry%20Yule">Henry Yule</a> remarked with some surprise the accuracy of the account in Chinese sources, which even named the negotiator of the peace settlement as "Yenyo", or <a href="Ioannes%20Pitzigaudes">Ioannes Pitzigaudes</a>, the unnamed envoy sent to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> in <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>'s account in which he mentions an augmentation of tributary payments a few years later due to the Umayyads facing some financial troubles.

The narrative of the siege accepted by modern historians relies largely on Theophanes' account, while the Arab and <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> sources do not mention any siege, but rather individual campaigns, only a few of which reached as far as Constantinople. Thus the capture of an island named Arwad "in the sea of "Kustantiniyya"" is recorded for 673/674, although it is unclear if this refers to the Sea of Marmara or the Aegean, and Yazid's 676 expedition is also said to have reached Constantinople. The Syriac chroniclers also disagree with Theophanes in placing the decisive battle and destruction of the Arab fleet by Greek fire in 674 during an Arab expedition against the coasts of Lycia and Cilicia, rather than Constantinople. This was followed by the landing of Byzantine forces in Syria in 677/678, which began the Mardaite uprising that threatened the Caliphate's grip on Syria enough to result in the peace agreement of 678/679.

Based on a re-evaluation of the original sources used by the medieval historians, the Oxford scholar <a href="James%20Howard-Johnston">James Howard-Johnston</a>, in his acclaimed 2010 book "Witnesses to a World Crisis: Historians and Histories of the Middle East in the Seventh Century", rejects the traditional interpretation of events, based on Theophanes, in favour of the Syriac chroniclers' version. Howard-Johnston asserts that no siege actually took place, based not only on its absence in the eastern sources, but also on the logistical impossibility of such an undertaking for the duration reported. Instead, he believes that the reference to a siege was a later interpolation, influenced by the events of the second Arab siege of 717–718, by an anonymous source that was then used by Theophanes. According to Howard-Johnston, "The blockade of Constantinople in the 670s is a myth which has been allowed to mask the very real success achieved by the Byzantines in the last decade of Mu'awiya’s caliphate, first by sea off Lycia and then on land, through an insurgency which, before long, aroused deep anxiety among the Arabs, conscious as they were that they had merely coated the Middle East with their power".

On the other hand, Marek Jankowiak at https://www.academia.edu/7091574/The_First_Arab_Siege_of_Constantinople argues that a major Arab siege did occur but that Theophanes (writing about 140 years after the events, based on an anonymous source itself written about 50 years after the events) misdated and garbled the events, and that the proper dating of the siege should be 667-669, with Spring 668 for the major attack.

Ben Paschal

Benjamin Edwin Paschal (October 13, 1895 – November 10, 1974) was an American baseball <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> who played eight seasons in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> from 1915 to 1929, mostly for the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. After two "<a href="cup%20of%20coffee">cup of coffee</a>" stints with the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> in 1915 and the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> in 1920, Paschal spent most of his career as the fourth outfielder and right-handed <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> of the Yankees' <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> championship teams of the late 1920s. Paschal is best known for <a href="batting%20average">hitting</a> .360 in the <a href="1925%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1925 season</a> while standing in for <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, who missed the first 40 games with a stomach ailment.

During his time in baseball, Paschal was described as a <a href="five-tool%20player">five-tool player</a> who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Famers</a> Ruth and <a href="Earle%20Combs">Earle Combs</a>, and star <a href="Bob%20Meusel">Bob Meusel</a>, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have <a href="games%20played">started</a> for most other teams in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>. He was one of the best pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.

The son of farmers, Paschal was born in <a href="Enterprise%2C%20Alabama">Enterprise</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, and grew up in nearby <a href="Sanford%2C%20Alabama">Sanford</a>. 

He played collegiate sports at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a>, before beginning his professional career with Dothan of the <a href="Georgia%20State%20League">Georgia State League</a>, where he played with future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> player <a href="Bill%20Terry">Bill Terry</a>. Paschal played in 64 games, with a .280 batting average, and his ability attracted the attention of <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scouts</a> in the area. 

Signed as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> for the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> at age 19, Paschal appeared in nine games, collecting one <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> on August 16, which broke up a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> by <a href="Bernie%20Boland">Bernie Boland</a> with two <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a> in the ninth <a href="inning">inning</a>. The Indians declared Paschal too inexperienced, and he was sent to the <a href="Muskegon%20Reds">Muskegon Reds</a> of the <a href="Central%20League%20%28baseball%29">Central League</a>. The league disbanded in the middle of the 1917 season, and Paschal became a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>.

After a two-year break from baseball because of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Paschal moved on to the <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets%20%28baseball%29">Charlotte Hornets</a> of the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20League%20%281919%E2%80%9330%29">South Atlantic League</a>, where he played from 1920 to 1923. He finished third in the league in batting average in 1920. While in the Southern League, he was nicknamed "the man who hits sticks of dynamite".

At the conclusion of the 1920 season, Paschal's contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox, with an option to keep him if he met certain playing expectations. He appeared in nine games for the Red Sox; his first game brought three hits against pitcher <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Acosta%20%28baseball%29">José Acosta</a> of the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>, and in total he batted .357 with five <a href="run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBI), but the Red Sox believed he lacked fielding experience and he returned to Charlotte. In August 1921, Paschal was sold to the <a href="Rochester%20Red%20Wings">Rochester Red Wings</a>. However, while <a href="slide%20%28baseball%29">sliding</a> in a game on August 20, 1921, he suffered a broken leg which sidelined him for the rest of the season and voided the contract with the Red Wings. He was hitting .317 at the time of the injury. In 1922, Paschal played in 142 games, hitting .326 with 18 home runs and improved these figures in 1923, achieving 200 hits, 22 <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a>, and 26 home runs in 141 games for a batting average of .351, the fourth best in the league. Paschal began the 1924 season with the <a href="Atlanta%20Crackers">Atlanta Crackers</a> of the <a href="Southern%20Association">Southern Association</a>. He scored 136 <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a>, while batting .341 and <a href="stolen%20base">stealing</a> 24 bases.

The New York Yankees bought Paschal from the Crackers near the end of the <a href="1924%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1924 season</a> and he played in four games. His only three hits, as well as three RBI, came in a defeat by the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> on September 19.

During <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a>, Paschal narrowly escaped serious injury while traveling on a bus. The vehicle rolled backwards down a hill and Paschal, along with several other teammates, jumped off before it hit a tree at high speed. The media expected Paschal to be <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s understudy prior to the <a href="1925%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1925 season</a>, but Ruth collapsed at an <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville</a>, North Carolina, train station just before the regular season's start. Emergency surgery for a "intestinal abscess" left him hospitalized for six weeks. Originally, Paschal was only to be used against left-handed pitchers, but Yankees manager <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a> named him as Ruth's temporary replacement in the outfield. In the first game of the year, Paschal hit a home run in a 5–1 win against the <a href="1924%20World%20Series">defending World Series</a>-champion Washington Senators. After another game-winning home run against the Senators two weeks later, the New York press noted that he was "making fans forget about Babe Ruth". Paschal's weakness against right-handed pitchers prompted the Yankees to acquire veteran outfielder <a href="Bobby%20Veach">Bobby Veach</a>, but his declining skills allowed Paschal to retain his position on the team. He hit another game-winning home run against the Cleveland Indians on May 23. At the time, Paschal was fifth in the league in batting average at .403, behind <a href="Sammy%20Hale">Sammy Hale</a>, <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Tris%20Speaker">Tris Speaker</a>, and teammate <a href="Earle%20Combs">Earle Combs</a>. His six home runs in May set a Yankee rookie record for a month, later equaled by <a href="Joe%20Gordon">Joe Gordon</a>, then topped by <a href="Shane%20Spencer">Shane Spencer</a>'s nine in September 1998.

Ruth returned to the lineup on June 1, relegating Paschal to the bench. In July, an injury to Combs allowed Paschal to start several games in <a href="Baseball%20field%23outfield">center field</a>. He then started the majority of August and all of September when <a href="Bob%20Meusel">Bob Meusel</a> moved to <a href="third%20base">third base</a> to cover for an injured <a href="Joe%20Dugan">Joe Dugan</a>. He hit two home runs during a September 8 game against the Red Sox, but his season ended when he was hit on the leg with a pitch on September 12 against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>. In 89 games, Paschal's batting average for the season was .360, 70 points higher than Ruth, with 12 home runs and 56 RBI.

Paschal was set to enter the <a href="1926%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1926 season</a> as the fourth outfielder, for which he was sent a new contract. After threatening to hold out for more money, the Yankees sent him a new contract which he signed on February 17 for an estimated $7,000 ( today). He began the season as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a>, but injuries quickly took their toll on the Yankees. Paschal started most of July and August, replacing an injured Meusel, who broke a bone in his right foot. Paschal hit an <a href="inside-the-park%20home%20run">inside-the-park home run</a> in a victory against the Indians on July 9. With the Yankees in a close <a href="pennant%20race">pennant race</a> in mid-August, Paschal hit a home run in a loss to the Detroit Tigers. Further successes came with a vital pinch-hit <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> in a win against the Athletics on September 6 and a home run on September 8. The Yankees clinched the pennant on September 15, and Paschal scored the game-winning single. The Yankees faced the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="1926%20World%20Series">1926 World Series</a>, and Paschal, pinch hitting for Joe Dugan, <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">singled</a> in <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> tying the contest at 2–2 in the ninth inning of Game 5. <a href="Tony%20Lazzeri">Tony Lazzeri</a> hit a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> in the tenth to win the game for the Yankees, but they lost the next two games and the Series. He had played in 96 games, hitting 7 home runs with 32 runs batted in.

Before the <a href="1927%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1927 season</a>, Paschal returned his playing contract unsigned because of a salary dispute. By that time, the Yankees were forming the nucleus of what became the <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> teams of the late 1920s. He signed for an estimated $8,000 ($ today), a 13% raise. In the season-opening win against the Athletics, right field starter Babe Ruth struck out twice and <a href="Batted%20ball">popped out</a>, forcing Huggins to replace him with Paschal in the sixth inning. As the last man ever to pinch-hit for Ruth, Paschal singled. In one of his few starts of the 1927 season, Paschal was a single short of <a href="hitting%20for%20the%20cycle">hitting for the cycle</a>, and almost had three home runs. Replacing the injured Bob Meusel, Paschal hit two home runs, a triple that was yards shy of a home run, and a double which bounced off the right field stands during an 11–2 rout of the Indians. Paschal did not play in the Yankees' <a href="1927%20World%20Series">1927 World Series</a> victory over the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. Overall, he played in 50 games, primarily as a pinch hitter. After the season, Paschal was discussed as a trade for Boston Red Sox <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Red%20Ruffing">Red Ruffing</a>, but discussions fell apart (Ruffing was later acquired in a proposed trade during the 1930 season).

Paschal was used heavily as a pinch hitter during the <a href="1928%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1928 season</a>. Huggins credited Paschal's timely pinch hitting as part of the Yankees' success that season. One of the few highlights of his season was his RBI pinch-hit double in the 10th inning that helped the Yankees beat the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> on August 4. Paschal played in 65 games that season, having a .316 batting average. He shared center field duties with <a href="Cedric%20Durst">Cedric Durst</a> for an injured Earle Combs during the Yankees' win over the Cardinals in the <a href="1928%20World%20Series">1928 World Series</a>. He started the first and last games of the series on a <a href="platoon%20system">platoon</a> situation; Paschal faced left-handed pitchers and Durst faced right-handed pitchers.

Before the <a href="1929%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1929 season</a>, Paschal and Durst were mentioned in several trade rumors, and Paschal was rarely used, appearing in only 42 games as a sixth outfielder in the season. A rare <a href="Starting%20lineup%23Baseball">start</a> came on June 1 against the White Sox, when he scored a run. On July 2, Paschal hit a pinch-hit home run for <a href="Herb%20Pennock">Herb Pennock</a> in the seventh inning of a game against the Red Sox to give the Yankees a 3–2 win. He played in 42 games in his final season in the majors, posting a .208 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> in 81 at-bats.

During his time with the Yankees, Paschal was considered a quiet player with a colorless personality. His appearances were limited by the presence of future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Famers</a> Ruth and Combs, and star Bob Meusel in the outfield. He was part a group including <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> and <a href="Mark%20Koenig">Mark Koenig</a> which preferred watching a film to carousing after a game; they were dubbed the team's "movie crowd".

After the 1929 season, Paschal was, along with <a href="Wilcy%20Moore">Wilcy Moore</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Grabowski">Johnny Grabowski</a>, part of a trade for catcher <a href="Bubbles%20Hargrave">Bubbles Hargrave</a> to the <a href="St.%20Paul%20Saints">St. Paul Saints</a> of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a> (AA). In one 1930 game against the <a href="Toledo%20Mud%20Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a>, Paschal had four hits and four RBI in a 23–4 win that broke the AA record for most runs scored in a game. In 144 games, Paschal finished the 1930 season with 204 hits, 10 home runs, and a .350 batting average. The following season, Paschal played 121 games to hit .336, while his average in 1932 was .325 in 147 games. During one game in the 1932 season, Paschal had three doubles and three singles, tying the AA record for most hits in a game. His skills declined during the 1933 season; in 130 games he hit just .272 with seven home runs. He left St. Paul and signed as a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> with the <a href="Knoxville%20Smokies">Knoxville Smokies</a> on December 30, 1933. The "St. Petersburg Evening Independent" reported a few months later that Paschal was "struggling to keep his job" in the minors. He was released by Knoxville and signed with the Scranton Miners of the <a href="New%20York%E2%80%93Pennsylvania%20League%20%281923%E2%80%9337%29">New York–Penn League</a>. After a few games with the Miners, Paschal returned home to North Carolina, where he accepted a managerial job for a <a href="semi-professional">semi-professional</a> baseball team in <a href="Catawba%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Catawba County</a>.

Paschal was married and had a child, Ben Jr. 

He died in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte</a>, North Carolina, at the age of 79, and is interred at <a href="Sharon%20Memorial%20Park">Sharon Memorial Park</a>.

John Douglas (architect)

John Douglas (11 April 183023 May 1911) was an English architect who designed over 500 buildings in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, and northwest England, in particular in the estate of <a href="Eaton%20Hall%20%28Cheshire%29">Eaton Hall</a>. He was trained in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a> and practised throughout his career from an office in <a href="Chester">Chester</a>. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants.

Douglas's output included new churches, <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restoring</a> and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, and a variety of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were <a href="Eclecticism%20in%20art">eclectic</a>. Douglas worked during the period of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a>, and many of his works incorporate elements of the <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">English Gothic</a> style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of <a href="Vernacular%20architecture">vernacular</a> elements in his buildings, in particular <a href="Timber%20framing">half-timbering</a>, influenced by the <a href="Black-and-white%20Revival%20architecture">black-and-white revival</a> in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, <a href="pargeting">pargeting</a>, and the use of decorative brick in <a href="Diaper%20%28architecture%29">diapering</a> and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of <a href="joiner">joiner</a>y and highly detailed wood carving.

Throughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the <a href="Duke%20of%20Westminster">Grosvenor</a> family of Eaton Hall. Most of his works have survived, particularly his churches. The city of Chester contains a number of his structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and <a href="Eastgate%20and%20Eastgate%20Clock">Eastgate Clock</a>. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of <a href="Eccleston%2C%20Cheshire">Eccleston</a>, <a href="Aldford">Aldford</a> and <a href="Pulford">Pulford</a>.

John Douglas was born at Park Cottage, <a href="Sandiway">Sandiway</a>, Cheshire, on 11 April 1830 and baptised on 16 May 1830 at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Weaverham">St Mary's Church, Weaverham</a>. He was the second of the four children, and the only son, of John Douglas and his wife Mary née Swindley (1792–1863). John Douglas senior was born in <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a> about 1798–1800 and his wife was born in <a href="Aldford">Aldford</a>, a village on the <a href="Eaton%20Hall%2C%20Cheshire">Eaton</a> estate in Cheshire; her father was the village <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> at <a href="Eccleston%2C%20Cheshire">Eccleston</a>, another village in the Eaton estate. John Douglas senior was by trade a builder and <a href="joiner">joiner</a>, and also described himself as a <a href="Construction%20surveying">surveyor</a> and a timber merchant. In 1835 he acted as architect for a house at <a href="Hartford%2C%20Cheshire">Hartford</a>, a village between Sandiway and <a href="Northwich">Northwich</a>. At the time of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201851">1851 census</a> he was employing 48 men. He owned land in Sandiway, and a house and land in the neighbouring village of <a href="Cuddington%2C%20Vale%20Royal">Cuddington</a>.

Nothing is known of John Douglas junior's school education. He gained knowledge and experience in his father's building yard and workshop which were attached to the family house. In the mid or late 1840s he was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> to <a href="Edward%20Graham%20Paley">E. G. Paley</a>, of <a href="Sharpe%20and%20Paley">Sharpe and Paley</a>, architects in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a>, Lancashire. When his articles were completed, Douglas became Paley's chief assistant. In either 1855 or 1860 he established his own office at No. 6 Abbey Square, Chester.

Douglas's elder sister, Elizabeth, was born in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848. Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's daughter from <a href="Bangor-on-Dee">Bangor-is-y-Coed</a>, <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>, on 25 January 1860 in <a href="St%20Dunawd%27s%20Church%2C%20Bangor%20Is-coed">St Dunawd's Church</a> in the village, a church he was later to restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6 Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No. 4. Their five children were born in these houses, John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. Only two of the children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a> in 1868, Jerome lived for only a few days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.

About 1876 the family moved to live at <a href="31%20and%2033%20Dee%20Banks%2C%20Chester">31 and 33 Dee Banks</a>, Chester, one of a pair of semi-detached houses overlooking the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Wales">River Dee</a>, which were built by Douglas. His wife died in 1878 from <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a> after a year's illness. Douglas did not remarry. His son Colin trained as an architect and worked in Douglas's office but died in 1887 at the age of 23 from <a href="Tuberculosis">consumption</a>. His other son Sholto is not known to have had any profession but he was a heavy drinker of alcohol. During the 1890s Douglas built a large house for himself, <a href="Walmoor%20Hill">Walmoor Hill</a>, also at Dee Banks overlooking the river. Here he lived until his death on 23 May 1911 at the age of 81. His funeral was held at <a href="Overleigh%20Cemetery">Overleigh old cemetery</a>, Chester, where he was buried. The following Sunday a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Sandiway">St John the Evangelist's Church, Sandiway</a>. His <a href="Estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> amounted to a little over £32,000 (). Apart from his surviving buildings, only two memorials remain to his memory. One is a tablet in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Boughton">St Paul's Church, Boughton</a>, the church in which he worshipped and which he had rebuilt. The other is a plaque placed on one of his <a href="2%E2%80%9318%20St%20Werburgh%20Street%2C%20Chester">buildings in St Werburgh Street</a>, Chester, in 1923 by his pupils and assistants.

Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.

Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a <a href="Briefcase">portfolio</a> and an <a href="Hearing%20aid">ear trumpet</a>. According to architectural historian <a href="Edward%20Hubbard">Edward Hubbard</a>, Douglas's life "seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture ... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries". His obituary in the "<a href="Chester%20Chronicle">Chester Chronicle</a>" stated that he "lived heart and soul in his profession".

Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Boughton">St Paul's Church, Boughton</a>, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an <a href="Oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a>. He also had a "strong sense of national loyalty", incorporating statues of <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a> at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester. Douglas was not good at handling the financial matters of his practice. The <a href="Hugh%20Grosvenor%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Westminster">Duke of Westminster's</a> secretary wrote of him in 1884, "A good architect but a poor hand at accounts!". Delay in presenting his accounts often led to difficulties and confusion; such delay sometimes amounted to as much as ten years. Otherwise very little is known about his personal life. No family papers have survived and none of the documents from the office at 6 Abbey Square has been found.

Douglas designed some 500 buildings. He built at least 40 new churches or chapels, <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restored</a>, altered or made additions to many other churches, and designed fittings and furniture for the interiors of churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas's works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>, cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further afield, in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, Staffordshire, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> and Scotland.

Throughout his career Douglas attracted commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, which is no longer in existence, for the garden of the Honourable Mrs Cholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of <a href="Hugh%20Cholmondeley%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Delamere">Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere</a>, and it was from the 2nd Baron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at <a href="Vale%20Royal%20Abbey">Vale Royal Abbey</a> in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Winsford">St John the Evangelist</a> at <a href="Over%2C%20Cheshire">Over</a>, <a href="Winsford">Winsford</a>, as a memorial to his first wife.

Douglas's most important patrons were the <a href="Duke%20of%20Westminster">Grosvenor</a> family of <a href="Eaton%20Hall%2C%20Cheshire">Eaton Hall</a>, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned to design the <a href="Grosvenor%20Park%2C%20Chester%23Grosvenor%20Park%20Lodge">entrance lodge</a> and other structures for <a href="Grosvenor%20Park%2C%20Chester">Grosvenor Park</a> in Chester, and <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Aldford">St John's Church</a> in the village of Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for <a href="Richard%20Grosvenor%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Westminster">Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster</a>. When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son <a href="Hugh%20Grosvenor%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Westminster">Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster</a>. Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the <a href="Hugh%20Grosvenor%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Westminster">2nd Duke</a>, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1st Duke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15 schools, around 50 farms (in whole or in part), about 300 cottages, lodges and <a href="Forge">smithies</a>, two factories, two inns and about 12 commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's <a href="Halkyn">Halkyn</a> estate in <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>, including another church.

Other wealthy landowners who commissioned work from Douglas included <a href="William%20Molyneux%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sefton">William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton</a>, <a href="Francis%20Egerton%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Ellesmere">Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere</a>, <a href="George%20Cholmondeley%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Cholmondeley">George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley</a>, <a href="Rowland%20Egerton-Warburton">Rowland Egerton-Warburton</a> of <a href="Arley%20Hall">Arley Hall</a>, Cheshire, and in Wales, the family of <a href="Baron%20Kenyon">Lord Kenyon</a>, and the Gladstone family, including <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">W. E Gladstone</a>. He also received commissions from industrialists, including <a href="John%20%26amp%3B%20Thomas%20Johnson">John & Thomas Johnson</a>, soap and <a href="alkali">alkali</a> manufacturers from <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>, <a href="Richard%20Muspratt">Richard Muspratt</a>, a chemical industrialist from <a href="Flint%2C%20Flintshire">Flint, Flintshire</a>, and <a href="William%20Lever%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Leverhulme">W. H. Lever</a>, soap manufacturer and creator of the village of <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a>.

Although the firm where Douglas received his training was in a provincial city in the north of England, it was at the forefront of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> in the country. The Gothic Revival was a reaction against the <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> style, which had been popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and it incorporated features of the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Both <a href="Edmund%20Sharpe">Edmund Sharpe</a> and E. G. Paley had been influenced by the <a href="Cambridge%20Camden%20Society">Cambridge Camden Society</a> and, more specifically, by <a href="Augustus%20Welby%20Northmore%20Pugin">A. W. N Pugin</a> who believed that "Gothic was the only correct and Christian way to build". Sharpe had also been influenced by <a href="Thomas%20Rickman">Thomas Rickman</a>, and he had written papers on medieval scholarship himself. Paley had been influenced by his brother, <a href="Frederick%20Apthorp%20Paley">Frederick Apthorp Paley</a>, who was enthusiastic about Gothic architecture, and who had also been influenced by Rickman. During the time Douglas was working in Lancaster the firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in Gothic Revival style, one of which was <a href="St%20Wilfrid%27s%20Church%2C%20Davenham">St Wilfrid's Church</a> in the Cheshire village of <a href="Davenham">Davenham</a>, some from Sandiway. Douglas's first church, that of <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Winsford">St John the Evangelist</a> at <a href="Over%2C%20Cheshire">Over</a>, <a href="Winsford">Winsford</a>, was entirely <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">English Gothic</a> in style, more specifically <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic">Early Decorated</a>.

Douglas's influences were not from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what has come to be known as the <a href="Victorian%20Gothic">High Victorian</a> style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently <a href="Hip%20roof">hipped</a>, round <a href="turret">turret</a>s with conical roofs, <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s, heavy <a href="corbel%23Corbel%20tables">corbel tables</a>, and the use of <a href="Polychrome">polychromism</a>. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of <a href="Dormer">dormer windows</a> rising through the <a href="eaves">eaves</a> and surmounted by hipped roofs.

Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in <a href="vernacular%20architecture">vernacular architecture</a>. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using <a href="timber%20framing">half-timbering</a> was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been <a href="Thomas%20Mainwaring%20Penson">Thomas Mainwaring Penson</a>, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and <a href="James%20Harrison%20%28architect%29">James Harrison</a> and it came to be developed mainly by <a href="Thomas%20Meakin%20Lockwood">T. M. Lockwood</a> and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> style. These include tile-hanging, <a href="Pargeting">pargetting</a> and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects <a href="William%20Eden%20Nesfield">Nesfield</a> and <a href="Richard%20Norman%20Shaw">Shaw</a>. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>.

A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his <a href="joiner">joiner</a>y, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a <a href="Dutch%20gable">Dutch gable</a>. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and <a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%20Church%2C%20Altcar">St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar</a>, the entire buildings were timber-framed.

Douglas's earliest significant commissions were for the <a href="Hugh%20Cholmondeley%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Delamere">2nd Baron Delamere</a> and were very different in type and style from each another. The addition of a wing to Vale Royal Abbey (1860) was in <a href="Elizabethan%20architecture">Elizabethan</a> style while <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Winsford">St John's Church</a> at <a href="Over%2C%20Cheshire">Over</a> (1860–63) was of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> in <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic">Early Decorated</a> style. The <a href="Over%20United%20Reformed%20Church">Congregational Chapel</a>, also at Over (1865) was again different, being built in <a href="Polychrome">polychromic</a> brick in <a href="Victorian%20Gothic">High Victorian</a> style. Meanwhile, Douglas had designed a shop at <a href="19%E2%80%9321%20Sankey%20Street%2C%20Warrington">19–21 Sankey Street</a>, Warrington (1864) with <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a> and detailed stone carving which Hubbard considers to be his "first building of real and outstanding quality...in its way one of the best things he ever did". Shortly after this came the first commissions for the <a href="Duke%20of%20Westminster">Grosvenor</a> family, consisting of a lodge and other structures in <a href="Grosvenor%20Park%2C%20Chester">Grosvenor Park, Chester</a> (1865–67), and <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Aldford">St John the Baptist's Church, Aldford</a> (1865–66). His first commission for a large house was <a href="Oakmere%20Hall">Oakmere Hall</a> (1867) for <a href="John%20%26amp%3B%20Thomas%20Johnson">John & Thomas Johnson</a>, industrialists of <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>. It is in High Victorian style and includes a main block and a service wing, a large tower on the south face, a small tower with <a href="turret">turret</a>s, a <a href="Porte-cochere">porte-cochère</a>, steep roofs and <a href="dormer">dormer</a> windows. Another early church was <a href="Old%20St%20Ann%27s%20Church%2C%20Warrington">St Ann's</a> at Warrington (1868–69), again High Victorian in style, which is described as being "quite startlingly bold" and "a prodigy church in Douglas's output". By 1869–70 Douglas had started to design buildings on the <a href="Eaton%20Hall%2C%20Cheshire">Eaton Hall</a> estate; in his study "<a href="The%20English%20House">Das englische Haus</a>", the German architect and writer <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a> included an illustration of the Eaton "Cheese-dairy". Around this time Douglas also re-modelled <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Dodleston">St Mary's Church, Dodleston</a>.

Many of the secular buildings in this period were smaller-scale structures. These include cottages in <a href="Great%20Budworth">Great Budworth</a>, and cottages, houses, schools and farms in the Eaton Hall estate and its associated villages. In 1872 he designed <a href="Shotwick%20House">Shotwick Park</a>, a large house in <a href="Saughall">Great Saughall</a>, built in brick with some half-timbering; it has steep roofs, tall ribbed chimneys and turrets. About the same time he reconstructed <a href="Broxton%20Old%20Hall">Broxton Higher Hall</a>, incorporating much half-timbering. Commissions for more large houses came in the late 1870s and 1880s. <a href="The%20Gelli">The Gelli</a> (1877) is a house in three <a href="Ell%20%28architecture%29">ranges</a> designed for the Kenyon sisters in the village of Tallarn Green, <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>. Also built for the Kenyon family is <a href="Tudor%20Court%2C%20Penley">Llannerch Panna</a> in <a href="Penley">Penley</a>, Flintshire (1878–79), which is "competent in its handling of timberwork". An entirely black-and-white house with <a href="jettying">jettying</a> is Rowden Abbey (1881) in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Back in North Wales, <a href="Plas%20Mynach">Plas Mynach</a> (1883) in <a href="Barmouth">Barmouth</a> includes much detailed woodwork internally.

In about 1879–81 Douglas built a terrace of houses on his own land in Chester, <a href="6%E2%80%9311%20Grosvenor%20Park%20Road%2C%20Chester">6–11 Grosvenor Park Road</a>, the road leading to the main entrance to Grosvenor Park, in High Victorian style. About 1883 he designed Barrowmore Hall (or Barrow Court) at <a href="Barrow%2C%20Cheshire">Great Barrow</a> (since demolished) which was one of his largest houses. Also around this time he designed buildings on the Eaton Hall estate, including <a href="Eccleston%20Hill">Eccleston Hill</a> (1881–82), a large house for the Duke's secretary, the <a href="Stud%20Lodge%2C%20Eaton%20Hall">Stud Lodge</a>, a smaller building of the same dates, <a href="Eccleston%20Hill%20Lodge">Eccleston Hill Lodge</a> (1881), a three-storey gatehouse at the main entrance to the park, with a high hipped roof and turrets, and <a href="Eccleston%20Paddocks">The Paddocks</a> (1882–83), another large house, this time for the Duke's land agent. In Chester city centre his designs included the <a href="Grosvenor%20Club%20and%20North%20and%20South%20Wales%20Bank">Grosvenor Club and North and South Wales Bank</a> (1881–83) in Eastgate Street, built in stone and brick, with a turret and a stepped gable, and <a href="142%20Foregate%20Street%2C%20Chester">142 Foregate Street</a> for the <a href="Cheshire%20Constabulary">Cheshire County Constabulary</a> (1884), with a shaped gable in Flemish style.

<a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Whitegate">St Mary's Church, Whitegate</a> was restored in 1874–75 for the <a href="Hugh%20Cholmondeley%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Delamere">2nd Baron Delamere</a>, retaining much of the medieval interior but rebuilding the exterior, adding a short chancel, and incorporating half-timbering. <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Boughton">St Paul's Church, Boughton</a> in Chester was Douglas's own parish church which he rebuilt in 1876 incorporating parts of the pre-existing building. Douglas's only church built entirely in half-timbering is the small church of <a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%20Church%2C%20Altcar">St Michael and All Angels</a> at <a href="Great%20Altcar">Great Altcar</a> in Lancashire. A church built in brick with half-timbering is <a href="St%20Chad%27s%20Church%2C%20Hopwas">St Chad's</a> (1881) at <a href="Hopwas">Hopwas</a> in Staffordshire. During this period Douglas built or restored a series of churches entirely in stone, incorporating mainly Gothic features together with vernacular elements. These include <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Hartford">St John the Baptist's Church, Hartford</a> (1873–75), St Paul's, <a href="Marston%2C%20Cheshire">Marston</a> (1874, now demolished), the Presbyterian Chapel (1875) at <a href="Rossett">Rossett</a>, <a href="Denbighshire">Denbighshire</a>, <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Church%2C%20Moulton">St Stephen's</a>, <a href="Moulton%2C%20Cheshire">Moulton</a> (1876), the rebuilding of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Chester">Christ Church</a>, Chester (also in 1876), the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin%2C%20Halkyn">Church of St Mary the Virgin</a> (1877–78) at <a href="Halkyn">Halkyn</a>, <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>, and the Welsh Church of <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Mold">St John the Evangelist</a> (1878) in <a href="Mold%2C%20Flintshire">Mold</a>, also in Flintshire. Later in this period he built <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Pulford">St Mary's Church</a>, at <a href="Pulford">Pulford</a> in 1881–84 for the Duke of Westminster and in 1882–85 <a href="St%20Werburgh%27s%20Church%2C%20Warburton%23New%20church">St Werburgh's New Church</a> at <a href="Warburton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Warburton</a> for <a href="Rowland%20Egerton-Warburton">Rowland Egerton-Warburton</a>.

In 1885–87 the partnership designed <a href="Abbeystead%20House">Abbeystead House</a> for the <a href="William%20Molyneux%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sefton">4th Earl of Sefton</a> in North Lancashire. Hubbard describes this as "the finest of Douglas's Elizabethan houses, and one of the largest which he ever designed". During this time additions were made to <a href="Jodrell%20Hall">Jodrell Hall</a> in Cheshire and <a href="Halkyn%20Castle">Halkyn Castle</a> in Flintshire. In 1885 the Castle Hotel at <a href="Conwy">Conwy</a>, <a href="Caernarfonshire">Caernarfonshire</a>, was remodelled, and in 1887–88 a strongroom was added to <a href="Hawarden%20Castle%20%2818th%20century%29">Hawarden Castle</a>, followed by a porch in 1890. During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate, and these included houses and cottages, such as <a href="Eccleston%20Hill">Eccleston Hill</a>, and <a href="Eccleston%20Ferry%20House">Eccleston Ferry House</a>, and farms such as <a href="Saighton%20Lane%20Farm">Saighton Lane Farm</a>. In 1890–91 an <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall. The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was <a href="Brocksford%20Hall">Brocksford Hall</a> (1893) in Derbyshire. This was a country house in Elizabethan style using <a href="Diaper%20%28architecture%29">diapered</a> brick and stone dressings with a clock tower. In Chester city centre, <a href="38%20Bridge%20Street%2C%20Chester">38 Bridge Street</a> (1897) is a timber-framed shop that incorporates a section of <a href="Chester%20Rows">Chester Rows</a> and contains heavily decorated carving. From 1892 the partnership designed houses and cottages in <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a> for <a href="Lever%20Brothers">Lever Brothers</a>. Also in the village they designed the <a href="Dell%20Bridge%2C%20Port%20Sunlight">Dell Bridge</a> (1894), and the school (1894–96), which is now called the <a href="Lyceum%2C%20Port%20Sunlight">Lyceum</a>. In 1896 Douglas designed a house for himself, <a href="Walmoor%20Hill">Walmoor Hill</a> in Dee Banks, Chester, in Elizabethan style. Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings on the <a href="2%E2%80%9318%20St%20Werburgh%20Street%2C%20Chester">east side of St Werburgh Street</a> in the centre of Chester. At its south end, on the corner of Eastgate Street, is a bank whose ground storey is built in stone, and behind this leading up St Werburgh Street, the ground storey consists of shop fronts. Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic, which are covered in highly ornamented timber-framing. On the first floor is a series of <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a>s, the second floor is <a href="Jettying">jettied</a>, and at the top are eleven gables. <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Pevsner</a> considers that this range of buildings is "Douglas at his best (though also at his showiest)". Hubbard expresses the opinion that "in this work, the city's half-timber revival reached its very apogee".

During the partnership, work continued on designing new churches and restoring older ones. In 1884–85 a chapel was built at Carlett Park at <a href="Eastham%2C%20Merseyside">Eastham</a> in the <a href="Wirral%20Peninsula">Wirral</a> and in 1884–87 St Deiniol's Church was built in <a href="Criccieth">Criccieth</a>, <a href="Caernarfonshire">Caernarfonshire</a>. <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Rossett">Christ Church, Rossett</a> (1886–92), <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Colwyn%20Bay">St Paul's Church, Colwyn Bay</a> (1887–88 with later additions), and <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Church%2C%20West%20Kirby">St Andrew's Church, West Kirby</a> (1889–91) followed. <a href="St%20John%27s%20Church%20Barmouth">St John's Church</a> in <a href="Barmouth">Barmouth</a>, <a href="Merionethshire">Merionethshire</a> was built between 1889 and 1895. It is one of the largest of Douglas's churches, although in 1891, during its construction, the tower collapsed and had to be rebuilt. Other churches built in North Wales were <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Bryn-y-Maen">Christ Church</a> in Bryn-y-Maen, Colwyn Bay, and <a href="All%20Saints%20Church%2C%20Deganwy">All Saints</a>, <a href="Deganwy">Deganwy</a> (both 1897–99).

In about 1891–92 the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20James%20the%20Great%2C%20Haydock">Church of St James the Great</a>, Haydock, was built. This was constructed in half-timber to give protection against possible mining subsidence. Other new churches built during this partnership were <a href="St%20Wenefrede%27s%20Church%2C%20Bickley">St Wenefrede's Church, Bickley</a> (1892), <a href="St%20David%27s%20Welsh%20Church%2C%20Rhosllannerchrugog">St David's Welsh Church</a> in <a href="Rhosllannerchrugog">Rhosllannerchrugog</a>, <a href="Denbighshire">Denbighshire</a>, <a href="All%20Saints%20Church%2C%20Higher%20Kinnerton">All Saints Church, Higher Kinnerton</a> (1893), the <a href="Crosby%20United%20Reformed%20Church">Congregational Church</a> in <a href="Great%20Crosby">Great Crosby</a> (1897–98), and <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Weston">St John the Evangelist's Church, Weston</a>, <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a> (1897–1900). A spire was added to <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Chester">St Peter's Church, Chester</a> in 1886–87 and a tower was added to <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Capenhurst">Holy Trinity Church, Capenhurst</a> in about 1889–90. In 1886–87 Douglas added a bell tower to <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%27s%20Church%2C%20Chester">St John the Baptist's Church, Chester</a> and this was followed by the rebuilding of its north aisle. Other restorations, embellishments, and additions of monuments and furniture were carried out in churches during this partnership.

In 1898 the firm designed <a href="St%20Oswald%27s%20Chambers%2C%20Chester">St Oswald's Chambers</a> in St Werburgh Street, Chester, and this was followed by further buildings in the city. In 1902–03 Douglas built <a href="St%20John%20the%20Evangelist%27s%20Church%2C%20Sandiway">St John the Evangelist's Church</a>, in the village of his birth, <a href="Sandiway">Sandiway</a>. It was built on land owned by Douglas and he paid for the cost of the chancel and the <a href="lych%20gate">lych gate</a>. In 1899 the <a href="Eastgate%20and%20Eastgate%20Clock">Diamond Jubilee Memorial Clock</a>, constructed in open <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a>, was erected on the Eastgate in Chester to commemorate <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria's</a> <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> in 1897. In 1898–1901 <a href="Public%20baths%2C%20Chester">Chester's public baths</a> were built; this was an unusual work for Douglas as it involved specialist engineering work. During this period one of Douglas's most important secular buildings was designed, <a href="St%20Deiniol%27s%20Library">St Deiniol's Library</a>, at <a href="Hawarden">Hawarden</a>, <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>, for <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">W. E. Gladstone</a> and his family. The first phase was constructed between 1899 and 1902, and the library was completed in 1904–06. Around this time the practice was commissioned to work on two churches in association with Gladstone; <a href="St%20Ethelwold%27s%20Church%2C%20Shotton">St Ethelwold's</a> (1898–1902) was a new church at <a href="Shotton%2C%20Flintshire">Shotton</a> in Flintshire, and additions were made to <a href="St%20Matthew%27s%20Church%2C%20Buckley">St Matthew's</a> at <a href="Buckley">Buckley</a>, also in Flintshire, between 1897 and 1905. The other new churches built during this period were Douglas's only Scottish church, the Episcopal Church (1903) in <a href="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a>, Dumfriesshire, and St Matthew's Church (1910–11) in <a href="Saltney">Saltney</a>, Flintshire. Alterations were made and furniture was designed for other churches. Douglas's last major project was the addition of a tower to his church of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Colwyn%20Bay">St Paul's</a> at Colwyn Bay, but he died before this could be completed.

Douglas published no writings of his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the "Abbey Square Sketch Book", which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17th centuries, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the <a href="Abbey%20Gateway%2C%20Chester">Abbey Gateway</a> in <a href="Chester">Chester</a>.

Douglas practised for the whole of his career in a provincial county town, and most of his works were concentrated in Cheshire and North Wales, yet he "conducted a practice which achieved national renown". He was never a member of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, but his works featured frequently in national publications, including "Building News", "<a href="Building%20%28magazine%29">The Builder</a>", "The Architect", and "The British Architect", the last of which particularly praised many of his works. A number of Douglas's works were exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> and appeared in "Academy Architecture". Douglas's obituary in "The British Architect" referred to him as having "achieved a reputation which has long placed him in the front rank of living architects". In the series "<a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">The Buildings of England</a>", <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> described him, without reservation, as "the best Cheshire architect". In the companion series "The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd", <a href="Edward%20Hubbard">Hubbard</a> expressed the opinion that he was "the most important and active local architect of the period". Critical praise was not confined to Britain; Douglas's works were acclaimed by the French architect <a href="Paul%20S%C3%A9dille">Paul Sédille</a>, and Muthesius wrote of his "consummate mastery of form". Despite this, the only official recognition he received in his lifetime was a medal for <a href="Abbeystead%20House">Abbeystead House</a>, which was shown at an exhibition in Paris.

Many of the architects training and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. Perhaps the best known of these were <a href="Edmund%20Kirby">Edmund Kirby</a> and <a href="Edward%20Ould">Edward Ould</a>. Kirby is best remembered for his <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style, including notably <a href="Wightwick%20Manor">Wightwick Manor</a> and various buildings at <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a>. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include <a href="Thomas%20Meakin%20Lockwood">Thomas Lockwood</a>, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.

A large proportion of Douglas's buildings still exist, many of them being <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>s, in a wide variety of types and styles. Douglas is not remembered for any one building type; his churches and houses are considered to be of equal importance. He was not a pioneer of any particular new development, but instead followed national stylistic trends while still retaining his individuality. His buildings are "anything but copyist" and they "bear a highly individual and nearly always recognisable stamp". The major characteristics of his buildings are "sure proportions, imaginative massing and grouping ... immaculate detailing and a superb sense of craftsmanship and feeling for materials". His work is "architecture which can be enjoyed as well as admired".

Battle of Edson's Ridge

The Battle of Edson's Ridge, also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge, Battle of Raiders Ridge, and Battle of the Ridge, was a land battle of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> between <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> (mainly <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>) ground forces. It took place from 12–14 September 1942, on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>.

In the battle, U.S. Marines, under the overall command of U.S. <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, repulsed an attack by the Japanese <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">35th Infantry Brigade</a>, under the command of Japanese Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a>. The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter that guarded <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. Kawaguchi's unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island.

Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal—about 12,000—Kawaguchi's 6,000 soldiers conducted several nighttime <a href="frontal%20assault">frontal assault</a>s on the U.S. defenses. The main Japanese assault occurred around Lunga ridge south of Henderson Field, manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units, primarily troops from the <a href="Marine%20Raiders">1st Raider</a> and <a href="Paramarines">1st Parachute</a> <a href="Battalion">Battalion</a>s under U.S. Marine Corps <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Merritt%20A.%20Edson">Merritt A. Edson</a>. Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun, Kawaguchi's attack was ultimately defeated, with heavy losses for the Japanese.

Because of the key participation by Edson's unit in defending the ridge, the ridge was commonly referred to as "Edson's" ridge in historical accounts of the battle in <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> sources. After Edson's Ridge, the Japanese continued to send troops to Guadalcanal for further attempts to retake Henderson Field, affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the <a href="Oceania">South Pacific</a>.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> to neutralize the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and support the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August the Allied landing forces had <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point () on the north shore of the island of Guadalcanal east of the present day capital of <a href="Honiara">Honiara</a>. Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops of the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> on Guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the Lunga Point area.

On 12 August, the airfield was named <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> after Major <a href="Lofton%20Henderson">Lofton Henderson</a>, a <a href="Naval%20aviator">Marine aviator</a> who had been killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.
In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army—a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul () and under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. The 17th Army—heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>—had only a few units available to send to the southern Solomons area. Of these units, the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">35th Infantry Brigade</a>—under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi—was at <a href="Palau">Palau</a>, the <a href="Aoba%20Detachment">4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment</a> was in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment—under the command of <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Kiyonao Ichiki—was embarked on transport ships near <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. The different units began to move toward Guadalcanal immediately; Ichiki's regiment—the closest—arrived first. The "First Element" of Ichiki's unit—consisting of about 917 soldiers—landed from destroyers at Taivu Point (), about east of the Lunga perimeter, on August 19.

Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Ichiki's First Element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of August 21. Ichiki's assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a>: all but 128 of the 917 men of the First Element (including Ichiki himself) were killed in the battle. The survivors returned to Taivu Point, notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul.
By 23 August, Kawaguchi's unit had reached <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>, the Japanese decided not to deliver Kawaguchi's troops to Guadalcanal by slow transport ship; instead, the ships carrying Kawaguchi's soldiers were sent to Rabaul. From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers, staging through a Japanese naval base in the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a>. The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, minimizing their exposure to Allied air attack. However, most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, could not be taken to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed destroyer runs to Guadalcanal, which occurred throughout the campaign, were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese. The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies. However, any Japanese ship remaining within the range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks. This "curious tactical situation" held for several months.

On 28 August, 600 of Kawaguchi's troops were loaded onto the destroyers , , , and , designated Destroyer Division 20 (DD20). Because of a shortage of fuel, DD20 could not make the entire round trip to Guadalcanal at high speed in one night, but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which conserved fuel. At 18:05 that day, 11 U.S. <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s from <a href="VMSB-232">VMSB-232</a> under the command of Lt. Col. Richard Mangrum, flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked DD20 about north of Guadalcanal, sinking "Asagiri" and heavily damaging "Yugiri" and "Shirakumo". "Amagiri" took "Shirakumo" in tow and the three destroyers returned to the Shortlands without completing their mission. The attack on DD20 killed 62 of Kawaguchi's soldiers and 94 crew members.
Subsequent "Express" runs were more successful. Between 29 August and 4 September, various Japanese light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, destroyers, and <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a>s were able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade, one battalion of the <a href="Aoba%20Detachment">Aoba Regiment</a>, and the rest of Ichiki's regiment. General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on the 31 August Express run, was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal. On the night of 4/5 September, as three of the Express destroyers—, , and —prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops, they detected and sank two U.S. ships in the vicinity, the small, old <a href="High%20speed%20transport">destroyer transports</a> (called "APDs" by the U.S. Marines) and that were used to shuttle Allied troops around the Guadalcanal/Tulagi area.

In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs, Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow barges. Therefore, a convoy carrying 1,100 of Kawaguchi's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges, mainly from the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment under the command of <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="Akinosuka%20Oka">Akinosuka Oka</a>, departed the northern coast of <a href="Santa%20Isabel%20Island">Santa Isabel</a> Island on 2 September. On 4–5 September, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy, killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit's heavy equipment. Most of the remaining 1,000 troops were able to land near Kamimbo (), west of the Lunga perimeter over the next few days. By 7 September, Kawaguchi had 5,200 troops at Taivu Point and 1,000 west of the Lunga perimeter. Kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces. Kawaguchi believed that there were only about 2,000 U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal.
During this time, Vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the Lunga perimeter. Between 21 August and 3 September, he relocated three Marine battalions—including the <a href="Marine%20Raiders">1st Raider Battalion</a>, under U.S. <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Merritt%20A.%20Edson">Merritt A. Edson</a> (Edson's Raiders), and the <a href="Paramarines">1st Parachute</a> Battalion—from Tulagi and <a href="Gavutu">Gavutu</a> to Guadalcanal. These units added about 1,500 troops to Vandegrift's original 11,000 men defending Henderson Field. The 1st Parachute battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo</a> in August, was placed under Edson's command.

Kawaguchi set the date for his attack on the Lunga perimeter for 12 September and began marching his forces west from Taivu towards Lunga Point on 5 September. He radioed 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on 9 September, and that naval warships be stationed off Lunga Point on September 12 to "destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island." On 7 September, Kawaguchi issued his attack plan to "rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the Guadalcanal Island airfield." Kawaguchi's plan called for his forces to split into three, approach the Lunga perimeter inland, and launch a surprise night attack. Oka's force would attack the perimeter from the west while Ichiki's Second Echelon—renamed the Kuma Battalion—would attack from the east. The main attack would be by Kawaguchi's "Center Body", numbering 3,000 men in three battalions, from the south of the Lunga perimeter. By 7 September, most of Kawaguchi's troops had started marching from Taivu towards Lunga Point along the coastline. About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade's supply base at Taivu.
Meanwhile, native island scouts—directed by British government official and officer in the <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate%20Defence%20Force">British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force</a>, <a href="Martin%20Clemens">Martin Clemens</a>—told the Marines of Japanese troops at Taivu, near the village of Tasimboko, about east of Lunga. Edson launched a raid against the Japanese troops at Taivu. Destroyer transports and and two patrol boats took 813 of Edson's men to Taivu in two trips. Edson and his first wave of 501 troops landed at Taivu at 05:20 (local time) on 8 September. Supported by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports, Edson's men advanced towards Tasimboko village but were slowed by Japanese resistance. At 11:00, the rest of Edson's men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, Edson's force pushed into the village. The Japanese defenders, believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards Lunga Point, retreated into the jungle, leaving behind 27 dead. Two Marines were killed.

In Tasimboko, Edson's troops discovered the supply base for Kawaguchi's forces, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a <a href="shortwave">shortwave</a> radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, and returned to the Lunga perimeter at 17:30. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack.
Edson and Colonel <a href="Gerald%20C.%20Thomas">Gerald Thomas</a>, Vandegrift's operations officer, believed that the Japanese attack would come at the Lunga Ridge, a narrow, grassy, long, coral ridge () parallel to the Lunga River just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to "rest" from their actions of the preceding month. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson's unit—including the 1st Raiders and the Paramarines—deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it.

Kawaguchi's Center Body of troops "was" planning to attack the Lunga perimeter at the ridge, which they called "the centipede" (mukade gata) because of its shape. On 9 September, Kawaguchi's troops left the coast at <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a>. Split into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield. Lack of good maps, at least one faulty compass, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag, costing a lot of time. At the same time, Oka's troops approached the Lunga perimeter from the west. Oka had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, <a href="Torture">extracted</a> from a <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> pilot captured on 30 August.

During the day of 12 September, Kawaguchi's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00, but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22:00. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11–12 September, causing a few casualties, including two killed.

The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols, but did not know exactly where or when they would attack. The ridge around which Edson deployed his men consisted of three distinct hillocks. At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 (so named because it rose above sea level). Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( high), the dominant feature on the ridge. The northernmost hillock was unnamed and about high. Edson placed the five companies from the Raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side, holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123. Two of the five Raider companies, "B" and "C", held a line between the ridge, a small, swampy lagoon, and the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a>. Machine-gun teams from "E" Company, the heavy weapons company, were scattered throughout the defenses. Edson placed his command post on Hill 123.

At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser and three destroyers shelled the Lunga perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by <a href="Major">Major</a> Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's "C" company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.

At first light on 13 September, Cactus Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge, forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The Japanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from Watanabe's battalion. At 05:50, Kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night.

Expecting the Japanese to attack again that night, Edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge. After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to Kokusho the night before, Edson repositioned his forces. He pulled his front back about to a line that stretched , starting at the Lunga River and crossing the ridge about south of Hill 123. Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies. Any Japanese attackers surmounting Hill 80 would have to advance over of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123. With only a few hours to prepare, the Marines were able to construct only rudimentary and shallow fortifications. They were low on ammunition, with one or two <a href="Hand%20grenade">grenades</a> for each Marine. Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (2/5) to move into a position just to the rear of Edson's troops. In addition, a battery of four <a href="M101%20howitzer">105mm howitzers</a> from the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%2011th%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment</a> under Lieutenant colonel <a href="James%20J.%20Keating">James J. Keating</a> moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with Edson's front line units.

Late in the afternoon, Edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying,

Edson's speech "raised the spirits" of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead.
As the sun set on 13 September, Kawaguchi faced Edson's 830 Marines with 3,000 troops of his brigade, plus an assortment of light artillery. The night was pitch black, with no moon. At 21:00, seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge. Kawaguchi's attack began just after nightfall, with Kokusho's battalion assaulting Raider Company B on the Marine right flank, just to the west of the ridge. The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123. Under Marine artillery fire, Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack. Without pausing to try to "roll-up" the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, Kokusho's unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the Lunga River, heading for the airfield. Kokusho's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations. Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, they paused to "gorge themselves" on the <a href="C-ration">"C"</a> and <a href="K-ration">"K" rations</a>. Kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack. At about 03:00, he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield, as well as Hill 123. In the heavy fighting that followed, Kokusho and around 100 of his men were killed, ending that attack.

Meanwhile, Kawaguchi's 2nd Battalion, under Major Masao Tamura, assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge. Marine observers spotted Tamura's preparations and called in artillery fire. At about 22:00, a barrage from twelve guns hit Tamura's position. In response, two companies of Tamura's troops—numbering about 320 men—charged up Hill 80 with fixed <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades. Tamura's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also Raider Company B, pushing the Parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline. To protect the exposed Raider Company B, Edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123.

At the same time, a Japanese company from Watanabe's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. Deciding that their positions were now untenable, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123. In the darkness and confusion of the battle, the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized. A few Marines began yelling that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas, scaring other Marines who no longer possessed their <a href="gas%20mask">gas mask</a>s. After arriving behind Hill 123, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word "withdraw" to anyone within earshot. Other Marines began to follow them. Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout, Edson, Major <a href="Kenneth%20D.%20Bailey">Kenneth D. Bailey</a> from Edson's staff, and other Marine officers appeared and, with "vivid" language, herded the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123.
As the Marines formed into a horseshoe-shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a <a href="Type%2041%2075%20mm%20Mountain%20Gun">"regimental" gun</a> to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the Paramarines swept forward, killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan, "The Japanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that subsides for a moment and then pours the harder ... When one wave was mowed down – and I mean mowed down – another followed it into death."

The Japanese hit Edson's left flank just after the Parachutists took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle, machine-gun, mortar, and grenade fire. Marine 105 mm and <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm</a> artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese. A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was "annihilated" by the Marine artillery fire, which only 10% of his company survived.

By 04:00, after withstanding several more assaults, some of which resulted in hand-to-hand fighting, and severe sniper fire from all sides, Edson's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn. Throughout the night, as Kawaguchi's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, Edson remained standing about behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain Tex Smith, who was in position to observe Edson for most of the night, "I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together, Edson did it that night. He stood just behind the front lines – stood, when most of us hugged the ground."

During the heavy fighting, portions of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura's and one from Watanabe's battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of "Fighter One", a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine <a href="1st%20Combat%20Engineer%20Battalion">engineers</a> stopped one Japanese company's advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. When no reinforcements joined them, both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Most of the rest of Watanabe's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night.

As the sun rose on 14 September, pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge. But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.

As the battle on the ridge took place, Kawaguchi's Kuma and Oka units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the Lunga perimeter. The Kuma battalion—led by Major Takeshi Mizuno—attacked the southeastern sector of the Lunga perimeter, defended by Marines of the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (3/1). Mizuno's attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. Mizuno was killed in the attack. After daybreak, the Marines, believing that the rest of Mizuno's battalion was still in the area, sent forward six <a href="Stuart%20tank">light tanks</a> without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines; four Japanese anti-tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them, and while some of the tanks' crewmen were able to escape the flames, several of them were bayoneted and killed by the Japanese. One tank tumbled down an embankment into the Tenaru River, drowning its crew.

At 23:00 on 14 September, the remnants of the Kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but were repulsed. A final "weak" attack by the Kuma unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated.

Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack.

At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> valley to join with Oka's unit, a march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp.

In total, Kawaguchi's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 in Watanabe's battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123. The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September.

On 17 September, Vandegrift sent two companies from the <a href="1st%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (1/1) to pursue the retreating Japanese. The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear-guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift. By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On 20 September, a patrol from Edson's Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them.

As the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment</a> (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the <a href="U.S.%207th%20Marine%20Regiment">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an unbroken line of defense around the Lunga perimeter. Vandegrift's forces' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <a href="Actions%20along%20the%20Matanikau">Matanikau River</a> from 23–27 September and 6–9 October.

On 15 September, General Hyakutake at Rabaul learned of Kawaguchi's defeat, the Imperial Japanese Army's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war. The general forwarded the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan. In an emergency session, the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that, "Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war." The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. Hyakutake realized that, in order to send sufficient troops and material to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal, he could no longer support the major Japanese offensive on the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Hyakutake—with the concurrence of the General Headquarters—ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within of their objective of <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>—to withdraw until the Guadalcanal matter was resolved. The Japanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby; the defeat at Edson's Ridge contributed not only to Japan's defeat in the Guadalcanal campaign, but also to Japan's ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific.

After delivering more forces during the next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal, led by Hyakutake, in late October 1942 at the <a href="Battle%20for%20Henderson%20Field">Battle for Henderson Field</a>, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese. Vandegrift later stated that Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, "we would have been in a pretty bad condition." Historian Richard B. Frank adds, "The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942, on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge."

Battle for Henderson Field

The Battle for Henderson Field, also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal or Battle of Lunga Point by the Japanese, took place from 23 to 26 October 1942 on and around <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The battle was a land, sea, and air <a href="battle">battle</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and was fought between the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Navy</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> (mainly <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States (U.S.) Marine</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>) forces. The battle was the third of the three major land offensives conducted by the Japanese during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

In the battle, U.S. Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, repulsed an attack by the <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Japanese 17th Army</a>, under the command of Japanese <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>. The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. Hyakutake's force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off the island.

Hyakutake's soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter, all repulsed with heavy Japanese losses. At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended U.S. positions on Guadalcanal from attacks by Japanese naval air and sea forces.

The battle was the last serious ground offensive conducted by Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and <a href="Operation%20Ke">evacuated</a> many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops—under the command of then <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of U.S. Marine Corps units—had <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The airfield was later named "Henderson Field" by Allied forces. The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army—a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. On 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.

Because of the threat from CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s or <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and came to be called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.

The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, with the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">6,000 soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> being defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a>. After their defeat at Edson's Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> on Guadalcanal.

Hyakutake immediately began to prepare for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The Japanese navy promised to support Hyakutake's next offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.

As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the <a href="U.S.%207th%20Marine%20Regiment">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> to Guadalcanal. This regiment had previously formed part of the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade and was fresh from garrison duty in <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.

General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a <a href="Actions%20along%20the%20Matanikau">series of small unit operations</a> around the Matanikau Valley.
The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between 23 and 27 September 1942 by elements of three U.S. Marine <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel <a href="Akinosuke%20Oka">Akinosuke Oka</a>'s local command. In the second action, between 6 and 9 October, a larger force of U.S. Marines crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division</a> under the command of generals <a href="Masao%20Maruyama%20%28Lieutenant%20General%29">Masao Maruyama</a> and <a href="Yumio%20Nasu">Yumio Nasu</a> and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese <a href="Aoba%20Detachment">4th Infantry Regiment</a>. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.

In the meantime, Major General <a href="Millard%20Harmon">Millard F. Harmon</a>, commander of U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Vice Admiral <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a>, commander of Allied forces in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">South Pacific Area</a>, that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus on 13 October, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th U.S. Infantry Regiment</a>, a <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> <a href="Army%20National%20Guard">Army National Guard</a> formation from the U.S. Army's <a href="Americal%20Division">Americal Division</a>, commanded by Colonel <a href="Robert%20Hall%20%28National%20Guard%20officer%29">Robert Hall</a>, to Guadalcanal.

Mikawa's ships continued nocturnal deliveries of men and materiel to Guadalcanal. Between 1 and 17 October, Japanese convoys delivered 15,000 Japanese troops, comprising the remainder of the 2nd Infantry Division and one regiment of the <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Infantry Division</a>, plus artillery, tanks, ammunition, and provisions, to Guadalcanal. One of these—on 9 October—landed General Hyakutake on the island to personally lead the Japanese forces in the planned offensive. Mikawa also sent heavy cruisers on several occasions to bombard Henderson Field. On the night of 11 October, one of these bombardment missions was intercepted by U.S. naval forces and defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Esperance">Battle of Cape Esperance</a>.
On 13 October, in order to help protect the transit of an important supply convoy to Guadalcanal that consisted of six slower cargo ships, the Japanese <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> commander <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> sent a naval force from <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a>—commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="Takeo%20Kurita">Takeo Kurita</a>—to bombard Henderson Field. Kurita's force—consisting of the battleships and , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers—approached Guadalcanal unopposed and opened fire on Henderson Field at 01:33 on 14 October. Over the next 83 minutes, they fired 973 shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of them falling in and around the area of the airfield. The bombardment heavily damaged the airfield's two runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, destroyed 48 of the CAF's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men, including six CAF aircrew.

Despite the heavy damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. Over the next several weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal. Observing the Japanese deliveries of troops and supplies to the island, American forces were expecting an imminent offensive by Japanese ground forces, but they were not sure where and when it would take place.

Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Thus, after observation of the American defenses around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by one regiment from 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a>. The 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi consisting of the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment. The date of the attack was set for 22 October. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General <a href="Tadashi%20Sumiyoshi">Tadashi Sumiyoshi</a> were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor. The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000.

At this time, the Lunga perimeter was defended by four American regiments comprising 13 infantry battalions. The 164th Infantry Regiment guarded the easternmost sector. Extending from the 164th south and west across Edson's Ridge to the Lunga River was the <a href="7th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Marine Regiment</a> under Colonel <a href="Amor%20L.%20Sims">Amor L. Sims</a>. Covering the sector west of the Lunga to the coast were the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st</a> and <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th</a> Marine Regiments. Defending the mouth of the Matanikau for the Americans were two battalions under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. McKelvy: the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">3d Battalion, 1st Marines</a>, and the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">3d Battalion, 7th Marines</a>. McKelvy's force was separated from the Lunga perimeter by a gap that was covered by patrols.

On 12 October, a company of Japanese engineers began to break a trail, called the "Maruyama Road", from the Matanikau towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. The trail traversed some of the most difficult terrain on Guadalcanal, including numerous rivers and streams, deep, muddy ravines, steep ridges, and dense jungle. Between 16 and 18 October, the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road, led by Nasu's unit and followed in order by Kawaguchi and Maruyama. Each soldier had been ordered to carry one artillery shell plus his pack and rifle.

Early on the morning of 20 October, Maruyama reached the Lunga River. Believing that his units were about south of the airfield, he ordered the left and right wing units to advance abreast of each other parallel to the Lunga north towards the American lines and set the time of the attack for 18:00 on 22 October. Maruyama, however, was mistaken. He and his troops were actually south of the airfield. By the evening of 21 October, it was clear to Maruyama that his units would not be in position to attack the next day, so he postponed the attack to 23 October and put his men on half rations to conserve their dwindling food supply. At nightfall on 22 October, much of the 2nd Division still remained strung out along the Maruyama Road, but Maruyama ruled out any postponement of the attack.

During this time, Sumiyoshi prepared his command to attack the American forces from the west. On 18 October, he began shelling Henderson Field with 15 <a href="Type%2096%2015%20cm%20Howitzer">howitzer</a>s. What remained of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">4th Infantry Regiment</a> under Colonel <a href="Nomasu%20Nakaguma">Nomasu Nakaguma</a> began to gather openly near Point Cruz (on the coast just west of the Matanikau). On 19 October, Colonel Akinosuka Oka led the 1,200 troops of his 124th Infantry Regiment inland across the Matanikau and began moving up the east bank towards high ground east of the river.

On 23 October, Maruyama's forces struggled through the jungle to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel <a href="Toshinari%20Sh%C5%8Dji">Toshinari Shōji</a>, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that the left and right wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.

On this day, the Japanese 11th Air Fleet under <a href="Jinichi%20Kusaka">Jinichi Kusaka</a> based at Rabaul sent 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a>2 "Betty" bombers and 28 <a href="A6M%20Zero">A6M2 Zero</a> fighters to attack Henderson Field. In response, 24 <a href="F4F%20Wildcat">F4F-4 Wildcats</a> and four <a href="P-39%20Airacobra">P-400 Airacobras</a> from the CAF (Cactus Air Force) rose to meet them, resulting in a large aerial battle. To Allied observers, the Japanese appeared to lose several aircraft in the day's engagements, but their actual losses are unknown. The CAF lost one Wildcat to battle damage but the pilot was uninjured.

Sumiyoshi was informed by Hyakutake's staff of the postponement of the offensive to 24 October, but was unable to contact Nakaguma to inform him of the delay. Thus, at dusk on 23 October, two battalions of Nakaguma's 4th Infantry Regiment and the nine tanks of the 1st Independent Tank Company launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau.
Nakaguma's tanks attacked in pairs across the sandbar at the mouth of the Matanikau behind a barrage of artillery. Marine <a href="37%20mm%20Gun%20M3"></a> <a href="Anti-tank%20warfare">anti-tank guns</a> and artillery quickly destroyed all nine tanks. At the same time, four battalions of Marine artillery, totaling 40 howitzers, fired over 6,000 rounds into the area between Point Cruz and the Matanikau, causing heavy casualties in Nakaguma's infantry battalions as they tried to approach the Marine lines. Nakaguma's attacks ended by 01:15 on 24 October, inflicting only light casualties on the Marines and gaining no ground.

Partly in response to Nakaguma's attacks, on 24 October the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 7th Marines</a> under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Herman%20H.%20Hanneken">Herman H. Hanneken</a> deployed to the Matanikau. After Oka's forces were sighted approaching the Marine Matanikau positions from the south, Hanneken's battalion was placed on a ridge facing south which formed a continuous extension of the inland flank of the Marine's horseshoe-shaped Matanikau defenses. A gap, however, still remained between Hanneken's left (east) flank and the main perimeter.

With the redeployment of Hanneken's battalion, the 700 troops of <a href="1st%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 7th Marines</a> under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Chesty%20Puller">Chesty Puller</a> were left alone to hold the entire line on the southern face of the Lunga perimeter east of the Lunga River. Late on 24 October, Marine patrols detected Maruyama's approaching forces, but it was now too late in the day for the Marines to rearrange their dispositions.
At 14:00 on 24 October, Maruyama's left and right wing units began to deploy for their attacks. Maruyama's troops had very little artillery or mortar support for their upcoming assault, having abandoned most of their heavy cannons along the Maruyama Road. Between 16:00 and 21:00, heavy rain fell, delaying the Japanese approach and causing "chaos" in the Japanese formations, already exhausted from the long march through the jungle. Shoji's right wing force accidentally turned parallel to the Marine lines, and all but one battalion failed to make contact with the Marine defenses. Shoji's 1st Battalion, 230th Infantry Regiment "stumbled" into Puller's lines about 22:00 and were driven off by Puller's men. For unknown reasons, Maruyama's staff then reported to Hyakutake that Shoji's men had overrun Henderson Field. At 00:50 on 25 October, Hyakutake signaled Rabaul that, "A little before 23:00 the Right Wing captured the airfield."

At about this time, Nasu's left wing battalions finally began to reach the Marine defenses. At 00:30 on 25 October, the 11th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion under <a href="Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29">Captain</a> Jiro Katsumata found and attacked Company A of Puller's battalion. Katsumata's attack was impeded by heavy <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> in front of the Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata's company.

Further west, the 9th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion charged straight into Puller's Company C at 01:15. Within five minutes, a Marine machine gun section led by <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> <a href="John%20Basilone">John Basilone</a> killed almost every member of the 9th Company. By 01:25, heavy fire from the Marine divisional artillery was falling into Nasu's troop assembly and approach routes, causing heavy casualties.

Recognizing that a major Japanese attack was underway, Puller requested reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Robert%20Hall%20%28National%20Guard%20Officer%29">Robert Hall</a> and being held in reserve, was fed piecemeal into Puller's line. In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in Puller's defenses before daybreak.

Just before dawn, Colonel Masajiro Furimiya, the commander of the 29th Infantry, with two companies from his 3rd Battalion plus his headquarters staff, was able to penetrate the Marine artillery fire and reach Puller's lines about 03:30. Most of Furimiya's troops were killed during their assault, but about 100 broke through the American defenses and carved a <a href="Salients%2C%20re-entrants%20and%20pockets">salient</a> in width and deep in the center of Puller's line. After sunrise, Furimiya's 2nd Battalion joined in the assault on Puller, but were thrown back. At 07:30, Nasu decided to withdraw most of the remainder of his troops back into the jungle and prepare for another attack that night.

During the day of 25 October, Puller's men attacked and eradicated the salient in their lines and hunted small groups of Japanese infiltrators, killing 104 Japanese soldiers. More than 300 of Maruyama's men in total were killed in their first attacks on the Lunga perimeter. At 04:30, Hyakutake rescinded the message announcing the capture of the airfield, but at 07:00 declared that the results of Maruyama's attack were unknown.

The Japanese 8th Fleet had task units ready to support the Army's attacks on Guadalcanal. Upon receipt of Hyakutake's message declaring success at 00:50 on 24 October, the task units went into action. The <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and three destroyers patrolled west of Guadalcanal to interdict any Allied ships that tried to approach the island. A First Assault Unit with three destroyers and a Second Assault Unit with the light cruiser and five destroyers approached Guadalcanal to attack any Allied ships off the island's north or east coast and to provide gunfire support for Hyakutake's forces.

At 10:14, the First Assault Unit arrived off Lunga Point and chased away two old U.S. destroyers converted to <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>— and ""—which were delivering aviation fuel to Henderson Field. The Japanese destroyers then sighted and sank the U.S. <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a> and <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a> "YP-284" before beginning their bombardment of the U.S. positions around Lunga Point. At 10:53, a Marine shore gun hit and damaged the destroyer , and all three Japanese destroyers withdrew while being strafed by four CAF Wildcat fighters.
As the Second Assault Unit approached Guadalcanal through <a href="Indispensable%20Strait">Indispensable Strait</a>, it was attacked by five CAF <a href="SBD%20Dauntless">SBD-3 Dauntless</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s. Bomb hits caused heavy damage to "Yura", and the unit reversed course to try to escape. More CAF air attacks on "Yura" throughout the day caused further damage, and the cruiser was abandoned and scuttled at 21:00 that night.

Meanwhile, 82 Japanese bombers and fighters from the 11th Air Fleet and from the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and attacked Henderson Field in six waves throughout the day and were engaged by CAF fighters and Marine anti-aircraft guns. By the end of the day, the Japanese had lost 11 fighters, two bombers, and one reconnaissance aircraft along with most of the aircrews in the downed aircraft. Two CAF fighters were destroyed in the day's fighting but both pilots survived. The Japanese air attacks caused only light damage to Henderson Field and the American defenses. The Americans later referred to this day as "Dugout Sunday" because the continuous Japanese air, naval, and artillery attacks kept many of the Lunga defenders in their foxholes and shelters throughout the day.

Throughout the day of 25 October, the Americans redeployed and improved their defenses against the Japanese attack they were expecting that night. In the west, Hanneken and the 5th Marines closed the gap between their two forces. Along the southern portion of the perimeter, Puller's and Hall's troops disentwined and repositioned. Puller's men fortified the western of the sector and the 164th soldiers took the eastern segment. The division reserve, the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment</a> was placed directly behind Hall's and Puller's positions.

Maruyama committed his reserve force, the 16th Infantry Regiment, to Nasu's left wing unit. Beginning at 20:00 on 25 October, and extending into the early morning hours of the 26th, the 16th and what remained of Nasu's other units conducted numerous unsuccessful frontal assaults on Puller's and Hall's lines. U.S. Marine and Army rifle, machine gun, mortar, artillery and direct <a href="Canister%20shot">canister fire</a> from 37 mm anti-tank guns "wrought terrible carnage" on Nasu's men. Colonel Toshiro Hiroyasu, the commander of the 16th, and most of his staff as well as four Japanese battalion commanders were killed in the assaults. Nasu was hit by rifle fire and mortally wounded, dying a few hours later. A few small groups of Nasu's men broke through the American defenses, including one led by Colonel Furimiya, but were all hunted down and killed over the next several days. Shoji's right wing units did not participate in the attacks, choosing instead to remain in place to cover Nasu's right flank against a possible attack in that area by U.S. forces that never materialized.

At 03:00 on 26 October, Oka's unit finally reached and attacked the Marine defenses near the Matanikau. Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left flank of the Marine positions on the ridge. A Company F machine gun section under <a href="Mitchell%20Paige">Mitchell Paige</a> killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep slope of the ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.

Responding to the Japanese capture of part of the ridgeline, Major <a href="Odell%20M.%20Conoley">Odell M. Conoley</a>—Hanneken's battalion <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a <a href="Military%20band">bandsman</a>. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions on top of the ridge. By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese back off the ridge, effectively ending Oka's attack. The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on the ridge and 200 more in the ravine in front of it. Hanneken's unit suffered 14 killed and 32 wounded.

At 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. Maruyama's men recovered some of their wounded from near the American lines on the night of 26–27 October, and began to withdraw back into the deep jungle. The Americans recovered and buried or burned as quickly as possible the remains of 1,500 of Maruyama's men left lying in front of Pullers's and Hall's lines. Said one U.S. Army participant, John E. Stannard, of the scene after the battle, "The carnage of the battlefield was a sight that perhaps only the combat infantryman, who has fought at close quarters, could fully comprehend and look upon without a feeling of horror. One soldier, after a walk among the Japanese dead, said to his comrade: 'My God, what a sight. There's dead Japs stretched from the Corner back along the edge of the jungle for a half a mile.'"

Maruyama's left wing survivors were ordered to retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while Shoji's right wing was told to head for <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a>, east of the Lunga perimeter. The left wing soldiers, who had run out of food several days before, began the retreat on 27 October. During the retreat, many of the Japanese wounded succumbed to their injuries and were buried along the Maruyama road. One of Maruyama's men, Lieutenant Keijiro Minegishi, noted in his diary, "I never dreamed of retreating over the same mountainous trail through the jungle we crossed with such enthusiasm... we haven't eaten in three days and even walking is difficult. On the up hill my body swayed around unable to walk. I must rest every two meters."

Leading elements of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at <a href="Kokumbona">Kokumbona</a>, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by battle deaths, combat injuries, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and would fight as a defensive force for the rest of the campaign. Later in November, U.S. forces <a href="Koli%20Point%20action">drove</a> Shoji's soldiers from Koli Point back to the Kokumbona area, with a battalion-sized Marine patrol attacking and <a href="Carlson%27s%20patrol">harassing them almost the entire way</a>. Only about 700 of Shoji's original 3,000 men ultimately returned to Kokumbona.

At the same time that Hyakutake's troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese warships under the overall direction of Isoroku Yamamoto moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to Hyakutake's ground offensive. Allied naval carrier forces in the area, now under the command of <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a> who had replaced Ghormley, also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle.

The two opposing carrier forces confronted each other on the morning of October 26, in what became known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retreated because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and significant damage to two carriers. This was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, but the loss of veteran aircrews was a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low.

Although the Japanese Army's attack on the Allied Lunga perimeter was decisively defeated in this battle, the Japanese were not yet ready to give up the struggle for Guadalcanal. The Japanese Army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further offensive against Henderson Field in November 1942.
The Japanese again planned to bombard Henderson Field with battleships in order to allow a convoy of transport ships to deliver the 38th's troops and heavy equipment. In contrast, however, to what occurred on 14 October, this time the U.S. Navy moved to intercept the battleship forces sent by Yamamoto from Truk to shell the airfield. During the ensuing <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> from 13–15 November, Allied naval and air forces turned back two Japanese attempts to bombard Henderson Field and almost completely destroyed the transport convoy carrying the remainder of the 38th Division. After this failure to deliver significant additional troops to the island, the Japanese commanders finally conceded defeat in the battle for Guadalcanal and <a href="Operation%20Ke">evacuated</a> most of their surviving troops by the first week of February 1943. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their <a href="Leapfrogging%20%28strategy%29">island-hopping</a> campaign against Japan, culminating in Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

Utah State Route 128

State Route 128 (SR-128) is a <a href="State%20highway%20%28US%29">state highway</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. The entire length of the highway has been designated the Upper Colorado River Scenic Byway, as part of the <a href="Utah%20Scenic%20Byways">Utah Scenic Byways</a> program. This road also forms part of the <a href="Dinosaur%20Diamond%20Prehistoric%20Highway">Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway</a>, a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byway">National Scenic Byway</a>. Residents of <a href="Moab%2C%20Utah">Moab</a> frequently refer to SR-128 as "the river road", after the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a>, which the highway follows.

The highway was originally constructed to connect rural cities in eastern Utah with <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction, Colorado</a>, the largest city in the region. Part of the highway was merged into the <a href="List%20of%20state%20highways%20in%20Utah">Utah state highway system</a> in 1931; the rest was taken over by the state and assigned route number 128 in 1933. Today, the highway is used as a <a href="Scenic%20route">scenic drive</a> for visitors to the area.

The highway crosses the Colorado River at the site of the Dewey Bridge, listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. This bridge was the longest suspension bridge in Utah until April 2008 when it was destroyed by a fire started by a child playing with matches.

SR-128 begins just north of <a href="Moab%2C%20Utah">Moab</a>, where it is commonly known as "the river road". The highway follows the southern bank of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> through a narrow, steep gorge, described as spectacular by "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic</a>". The sheer <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> walls of the gorge along Route 128 are recommended for their beauty on vacation guides from as far away as France and Germany.

As parts of the road are very narrow, with blind corners and no <a href="shoulder%20%28road%29">shoulders</a>, the <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Utah Department of Transportation</a> has prohibited trucks and vehicles over from the entire highway. In addition, a restriction at the junction with <a href="U.S.%20Route%20191%20in%20Utah">U.S. Route 191</a> (US-191) requires vehicles over wide to have two police escorts.

Between Moab and <a href="Castle%20Valley%2C%20Utah">Castle Valley</a>, the Colorado River, and indirectly, SR-128, form the southern boundary of <a href="Arches%20National%20Park">Arches National Park</a>. Arches National Park is so named because of over 2000 <a href="natural%20arch">natural arch</a>es inside park boundaries. While the highway does offer views of several features in the park, there is no park access along the highway. Popular attractions along this portion include <a href="Grandstaff%20Canyon">Grandstaff Canyon</a> (formerly Negro Bill Canyon), with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.

The gorge widens where the highway passes by Castle Valley and Professor Valley, which have been the shooting locations for many <a href="western%20film">western film</a>s (including "<a href="Wagon%20Master">Wagon Master</a>" and "<a href="Rio%20Grande%20%28film%29">Rio Grande</a>") and <a href="television%20commercial">television commercial</a>s. Near the east end of the valley the highway crosses Onion Creek, a stream sourced by springs that contain naturally occurring minerals that produce a strong odor in the water. At the east end of the valley the highway has a view of the Fisher Towers, a set of dark red <a href="spire">spire</a>s. After leaving the valley, the road winds farther up the river gorge until arriving at the Dewey Bridge, named for <a href="Dewey%2C%20Utah">Dewey</a>, a nearby <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a>.

After the bridge, the road follows the northern bank of the river for a few miles then exits the Colorado River gorge. At this point the highway proceeds across desert towards the <a href="Book%20Cliffs">Book Cliffs</a> to terminate at <a href="Interstate%2070%20in%20Utah">Interstate 70</a> (I-70) near <a href="Cisco%2C%20Utah">Cisco</a>. Cisco is a ghost town along the main line of the <a href="Denver%20and%20Rio%20Grande%20Western%20Railroad">Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad</a>, founded as a water re-filling station for <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s. The last of the road parallel the railroad and is an old routing of <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Utah">US-6</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Utah">US-50</a>, in use before the construction of I-70.

Access between Moab and Castle Valley was originally via a <a href="pack%20trail">pack trail</a> called the Heavenly Stairway. This trail, named for a dramatic descent of over , was described as beautiful, but difficult to navigate. Isolated from Utah's population centers, this area depended on <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a> and other cities in Colorado for both everyday supplies and a market for agricultural products. Moab residents pushed for a road to be built along the riverbank. By 1902, the trail was replaced with a toll road, called King's Toll Road, after Samuel King. King was an early settler who also operated the toll <a href="ferry">ferry</a> used prior to the construction of the Dewey Bridge. Rocks inscribed with "Kings Toll Road" can still be found along the roadway. While the road did improve travel, it was not built high enough above the river level and was often flooded.

The Dewey Bridge, built in 1916, originally carried SR-128 across the Colorado River. The bridge featured an all wood deck measuring long, wide from support to support and wide from rail to rail. The bridge also consisted of two metal towers, a run of seven cables on each side of the bridge deck, and cable anchors.

In 1912 <a href="Grand%20County%2C%20Utah">Grand County</a> unsuccessfully petitioned the state to finance the construction of a bridge. In 1913, the ferry was out of service for a time because ice in the river struck the ferry, causing it to sink. This raised the level of urgency for a more reliable river crossing. Grand County held a <a href="municipal%20bond">municipal bond</a> election, and was able to raise $25,000 (1913, approximately equivalent to $550,000 in 2008) to finance the construction of a bridge. The county employed the <a href="Midland%20Bridge%20Company">Midland Bridge Company</a> of <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, to build it. Plans originally called for the bridge deck to be wide, but with the bonds not producing the expected yields, the deck width was scaled down to . In 1916, the bridge was dedicated with a strength test by having approximately 70 attendees attempt to cross the bridge at once. The total was seven wagons, two people on horseback and several on foot. The bridge was designed to support the weight of six horses, three wagons, and of freight.

On the day of its completion, it was the second-longest <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a> west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. The longest was the <a href="Cameron%20Suspension%20Bridge">Cameron Suspension Bridge</a>, also built by the Midland Bridge Company, who used the same base plans for both bridges. The Dewey Bridge remained the longest suspension bridge in Utah until it was destroyed by fire in 2008.

As part of a tribute, a reporter for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Sentinel%20%28Colorado%29">The Daily Sentinel</a>" interviewed locals and visitors about their first experience crossing the bridge. Many recalled how nervous they felt as the bridge would creak and sway under load. One stated, "A lot of people lost a lot of mirrors on that bridge". Drivers with wide vehicles had to fold in their side mirrors to safely cross, as the bridge deck was only wide.

An agreement was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Utah Department of Transportation</a> (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge. As part of this agreement, UDOT would commission a new bridge and once finished, transfer ownership of the original bridge back to Grand County. Grand County agreed to petition to have the bridge be included in the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, assume maintenance and guarantee the bridge would be preserved. The nomination was approved and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984. In 1988, the replacement bridge was completed, and the title deed to the Dewey Bridge was handed over to the county in 1989. Grand County completed a restoration project in 2000.
After being replaced for automobile use, the Dewey Bridge was used by the <a href="Kokopelli%20trail">Kokopelli trail</a>, a bicycle trail, and a pedestrian trail. The east approach to the bridge features an abandoned gas station and the <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a> of <a href="Dewey%2C%20Utah">Dewey</a>. The west approach has been converted to a <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a> and park.

On April 6, 2008, a seven-year-old boy accidentally started a fire in a nearby campground while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a>s, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money, and no progress has occurred. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical.

Though the Colorado River runs for over in Utah, there are only three sites with bridges to cross it. One is the Dewey Bridge site where SR-128 traverses the waterway; the other two are an unnamed bridge that carries US-191 (built in 1911, replaced in 1955 and again in 2010) and the <a href="Hite%20Crossing%20Bridge">Hite Crossing Bridge</a> (built in 1966) used by <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%2095">SR-95</a>.

With the bridge finished in 1916, by the 1920s the toll road was reconstructed above the <a href="ordinary%20high%20water%20mark">ordinary high water mark</a> so it could be used year-round. The road was briefly used for the route of the <a href="Midland%20Trail">Midland Trail</a> across eastern Utah. However, by 1923 the trail had been moved to a more direct routing, similar to modern I-70. The road from Moab along the river to <a href="Castleton%2C%20Utah">Castleton</a> was added to the state highway network in 1931, as SR-129. In 1933, the route was redesignated SR-128 and extended to Cisco. The highway was gradually upgraded to a two-lane paved roadway.

The state legislature extended SR-128 about at its east end in 1969, due to the pending construction of Interstate 70. Plans called for the freeway to bypass the Cisco area, including the terminus of SR-128. The legislature transferred a portion of <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%204%20%281962-1977%29">SR-4</a> (the legislative designation for what was then signed US-6/US-50) near Cisco to the proposed interchange with I-70. When that part of I-70 was completed in 1971, signs were changed to SR-128 on its portion of the old road, while the remainder of the bypassed road through Cisco was relinquished to the county.

The highway was recognized by the <a href="Utah%20Scenic%20Byways">Utah Scenic Byways</a> program for its scenic value and given the name Upper Colorado River Scenic Byway. The highway was recognized as a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byway">National Scenic Byway</a> and named as part of the <a href="Dinosaur%20Diamond%20Scenic%20Byway">Dinosaur Diamond Scenic Byway</a> in 1998. A petition is currently before the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> to recognize Route 128 as an <a href="All-American%20Road">All-American Road</a>. To meet this criterion the highway must be deemed by the administration to have enough scenic value to be a "destination unto itself".

Gemini (2002 Tamil film)

Gemini is a 2002 Indian <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil-language</a> <a href="gangster%20film">gangster film</a> written and directed by <a href="Saran%20%28director%29">Saran</a> and produced by <a href="AVM%20Productions">AVM Productions</a>. The film features <a href="Vikram%20%28actor%29">Vikram</a> in the <a href="title%20role">title role</a> of a small-time criminal and aspiring <a href="boss%20%28crime%29">don</a> who, after falling in love, decides to refrain from crime; <a href="Kiran%20Rathod">Kiran Rathod</a> plays his love interest. <a href="Murali%20%28Malayalam%20actor%29">Murali</a> stars as Singaperumal, a police officer who inspires and guides Gemini in his attempts to reform. The cast includes <a href="Kalabhavan%20Mani">Kalabhavan Mani</a> as the principal antagonist while <a href="Vinu%20Chakravarthy">Vinu Chakravarthy</a>, <a href="Manorama%20%28Tamil%20actress%29">Manorama</a> and <a href="Thennavan%20%28actor%29">Thennavan</a> portray significant roles. Based on gang wars in <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>, the film delves into the lives of outlaws and the roles the police and society play in their rehabilitation and acceptance.

In early 2001, rival gangsters "Vellai" Ravi and Chera reformed themselves with the patronage of a police officer. Saran was inspired by this incident and scripted a story based on it. The film was initially entitled "Erumugam" with <a href="Ajith%20Kumar">Ajith Kumar</a> intended to play the lead role, but the project was shelved after a week's shoot when Ajith lost interest and left. Saran reworked the script, retitled the production "Gemini" and cast the new leads. The revived project was announced in August 2001. Production began shortly afterwards in December the same year and was completed by March 2002. The film was shot mainly at the AVM Studios in Chennai, while two song sequences were filmed in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The film had cinematography by <a href="A.%20Venkatesh%20%28cinematographer%29">A. Venkatesh</a> and editing by <a href="Suresh%20Urs">Suresh Urs</a> while the soundtrack was scored by <a href="Bharathwaj">Bharathwaj</a>.

The film's soundtrack was well received, with the song "O Podu" becoming a sensation in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>. "Gemini" was released two days ahead of the <a href="Puthandu">Tamil New Year</a> on 12 April 2002 and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the performances of Vikram and Mani but criticism towards Saran's script. Made at an estimated cost of , the film earned at the box office and became the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year. The film's success, largely attributed to the popularity of "O Podu", resurrected the Tamil film industry, which was experiencing difficulties after a series of box office failures. The film won three <a href="Filmfare%20Awards%20South">Filmfare Awards</a>, three <a href="International%20Tamil%20Film%20Awards">ITFA Awards</a> and four <a href="Cinema%20Express%20Awards">Cinema Express Awards</a>. Later that same year, Saran remade the film in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> as "<a href="Gemeni%20%28film%29">Gemeni</a>".

Teja (<a href="Kalabhavan%20Mani">Kalabhavan Mani</a>) is a high-profile gangster in North Madras who often imitates the behaviour characteristics of different animals for sarcastic effect. Accompanied by his gang, he arrives at a <a href="magistrate%27s%20court">magistrate's court</a> for a hearing. His animal antics are mocked at by "Chintai" Jeeva, another accused. Teja and his gang retaliate and kill Jeeva within the court premises. Jeeva was a member of a rival gang headed by Gemini (<a href="Vikram%20%28actor%29">Vikram</a>), an aspiring goon from <a href="Chintadripet">Chintadripet</a> who wants to dethrone Teja and take his place. To avenge Jeeva's death, Gemini hunts down the murderer Pandian while Isaac (Isaac Varghese), one of Gemini's men, kills him. This incident leads to a feud between Gemini and Teja, and a fight for supremacy ensues. Pandian's mother Annamma (<a href="Manorama%20%28Tamil%20actress%29">Manorama</a>), a destitute woman, locates the whereabouts of her son's murderers. She approaches Gemini, becomes the gang's cook, and awaits a chance to poison them.

Gemini meets and falls in love with Manisha (<a href="Kiran%20Rathod">Kiran Rathod</a>), a free-spirited college girl. To pursue her, he joins an evening class at her college and she falls in love with him, unaware of his true identity. Two businessmen approach Gemini to evict traders from a market so that a shopping complex can be built in its place. As the market is in his control, Gemini refuses the offer, and the businessmen hire Teja to execute the job. Feigning an altercation with Gemini, his sidekick Kai (<a href="Thennavan%20%28actor%29">Thennavan</a>) joins Teja's gang, acts as the inside man, and foils the plan. Teja becomes enraged at being outsmarted by Gemini.

Singaperumal (<a href="Murali%20%28Malayalam%20actor%29">Murali</a>), an astute police officer, is promoted to the position of <a href="Director%20General%20of%20Police">Director General of Police</a> (DGP). Keen on eradicating crime, he arrests both Gemini and Teja, and the arrests are made "off the record" owing to their political influence. Aware of the rivalry between them, Singaperumal puts them in a private cell so they can beat each other to death. While Teja tries to exact revenge for the market issue, Gemini does not fight back but persuades Teja to trick Singaperumal by pleading guilty and requesting a chance to reform. Gemini's trick works, and they are released.

Since Gemini was arrested at the college, Manisha discovers his identity and resents him. To regain her attention, Gemini reforms his ways. Though his gang initially disapproves of it, they relent. As Gemini and his gang regret their actions, Annamma reveals her true identity and forgives them. Singaperumal helps Gemini get back into college and reunite with Manisha. Teja returns to his gang and continues his illegal activities. He pesters Gemini to help him in his business. Gemini informs Singaperumal of Teja's activities; Teja is caught smuggling narcotics, is prosecuted, and serves a term in prison.

A few months later, Singaperumal is transferred, and a corrupt officer (<a href="Vinu%20Chakravarthy">Vinu Chakravarthy</a>) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja, and together, they urge Gemini to work for them and repay for the losses they incurred, but Gemini refuses. To force him to return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realises that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.

In February 2001, underworld dons "Vellai" Ravi and Chera, who terrorised the city of Madras (now <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>) in the 1990s, abandoned a life of crime and took up social work. The then-<a href="Superintendent%20of%20police%20%28India%29">DCP</a> of Flower Bazaar Shakeel Akhter presided over the oath-taking ceremony and welcomed the rehabilitation programme. During the making of his film "<a href="Alli%20Arjuna">Alli Arjuna</a>" (2002), director <a href="Saran%20%28director%29">Saran</a> came across a newspaper article carrying this piece of news and was fascinated. Shortly afterwards in March 2001, Saran announced his next directorial venture would be inspired by the incident. Titled "Erumugam" (meaning "upward mobility"), the project was scheduled to enter production after the completion of "Alli Arjuna".

The director disclosed that it was "a modern day <a href="rags%20to%20riches">rags to riches</a> story" where the protagonist rises from humble origins to an enviable position. The venture was to be funded by A. Purnachandra Rao of Lakshmi Productions. The film would mark the director's third collaboration with <a href="Ajith%20Kumar">Ajith Kumar</a> in the lead after the success of "<a href="Kaadhal%20Mannan">Kaadhal Mannan</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Amarkalam">Amarkalam</a>" (1999). <a href="Laila%20Mehdin">Laila Mehdin</a> and <a href="Richa%20Pallod">Richa Pallod</a>, who played the heroine in Saran's "<a href="Parthen%20Rasithen">Parthen Rasithen</a>" (2000) and "Alli Arjuna" respectively, were to play the female lead roles. While the recording for the film's audio reportedly began on 16 March 2001, the filming was to start in mid-June and continue until August that year, followed by post-production work in September. It was planned to release the film on 14 November 2001 coinciding with <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a>. However, after finding a more engaging script in "<a href="Red%20%282002%20film%29">Red</a>" (2002), Ajith lost interest; he left the project after a week's shoot and the production was shelved. Following this incident, Saran stated that he would never do another film with Ajith. The pair would, however, reconcile their differences later, and collaborate on "<a href="Attahasam">Attahasam</a>" (2004) and "<a href="Aasal">Aasal</a>" (2010).

Saran rewrote the script based on gang wars in Chennai and began the project again. The film, then untitled, was announced in August 2001 with Vikram to star in the lead role. The production was taken over by <a href="M.%20Saravanan%20%28film%20producer%29">M. Saravanan</a>, M. Balasubramaniam, <a href="M.%20S.%20Guhan">M. S. Guhan</a> and B. Gurunath of <a href="AVM%20Productions">AVM Productions</a>. The film was AVM's 162nd production and their first film after a five-year hiatus, their last production being "<a href="Minsara%20Kanavu">Minsara Kanavu</a>" (1997), the release of which marked fifty years since their debut "<a href="Naam%20Iruvar">Naam Iruvar</a>" (1947). By producing "Gemini", AVM became one of the four film studios that had been producing films for over fifty years. While titling the film, producer M. Saravanan chose "Gemini" among the many titles suggested to him, but because <a href="Gemini%20Studios">Gemini Studios</a> was the name of a major production house, Saravanan wrote to <a href="S.%20S.%20Balan">S. S. Balan</a>, editor of "<a href="Ananda%20Vikatan">Ananda Vikatan</a>" and son of Gemini Studios founder <a href="S.%20S.%20Vasan">S. S. Vasan</a>, requesting permission to use the title. In response, Balasubramanian gave his consent.

With Vikram cast in the title role, Saran was searching for a newcomer to play the female lead role of a Marwari woman. Kiran Rathod is a native of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, the place where the Marwaris originate from. She is a relative of actress <a href="Raveena%20Tandon">Raveena Tandon</a>, whose manager brought Rathod the offer to act in "Gemini". Saran was convinced after seeing a photograph of Rathod and cast her; "Gemini" thus became her debut Tamil film. <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam</a> actors Kalabhavan Mani and Murali were approached to play significant roles.

"Gemini" is widely believed to be Mani's first Tamil film, though he had already starred in "<a href="Vaanchinathan">Vaanchinathan</a>" (2001). There have been varying accounts on how he was cast: while Vikram claims to have suggested Mani for the role of Teja, Saran said in one interview that casting Mani was his idea, and contradicted this in another interview, saying that Mani was chosen on his wife's recommendation. While searching for an unfamiliar actor for the DGP's role, Saran saw Murali in "<a href="Dumm%20Dumm%20Dumm">Dumm Dumm Dumm</a>" (2001) and found him "very dignified". He chose Murali as he wanted that dignity for the role. Though he had planned to make Murali a villain at the end of the film, Saran decided against it because he was "amazed to see awe in everyone's eyes when Murali entered the sets and performed".

<a href="Thennavan%20%28actor%29">Thennavan</a>, <a href="Vinu%20Chakravarthy">Vinu Chakravarthy</a>, <a href="Ilavarasu">Ilavarasu</a>, <a href="Charle">Charle</a>, <a href="Dhamu">Dhamu</a>, <a href="Ramesh%20Khanna">Ramesh Khanna</a>, <a href="Vaiyapuri">Vaiyapuri</a>, <a href="Madhan%20Bob">Madhan Bob</a>, <a href="Thyagu%20%28actor%29">Thyagu</a> and <a href="Manorama%20%28Tamil%20actress%29">Manorama</a> form the supporting cast. <a href="Gemini%20Ganesan">Gemini Ganesan</a> made a cameo appearance in this film. The technical departments were handled by Saran's regular crew, which consisted of cinematographer A. Venkatesh, editor <a href="Suresh%20Urs">Suresh Urs</a>, <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a> <a href="Thota%20Tharani">Thota Tharani</a> and costume designers Sai and Nalini Sriram. The choreography was by <a href="Super%20Subbarayan">Super Subbarayan</a> (action) and Suchitra, <a href="Brinda%20%28choreographer%29">Brinda</a> and Ashok Raja (dance). The music was composed by Bharathwaj and the lyrics were written by Vairamuthu. <a href="Kanmani%20%28director%29">Kanmani</a> who went on to direct films like "<a href="Aahaa%20Ethanai%20Azhagu">Aahaa Ethanai Azhagu</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Chinnodu">Chinnodu</a>" (2006) worked as an assistant director.

"Gemini" was formally launched on 21 November 2001 at the <a href="Taj%20Connemara">Hotel Connemara</a>, Chennai in the presence of celebrities including <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> (through <a href="video%20conferencing">video conferencing</a>) and <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>. The launch function was marked by the submission of the script, songs and lyrics. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-December that year, but commenced slightly earlier. Vikram shot for the film simultaneously with "<a href="Samurai%20%282002%20film%29">Samurai</a>" (2002). When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant in accepting the film due to other commitments in Malayalam, shooting was rescheduled to film his scenes first. Saran persuaded Mani to allot dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a <a href="Impersonator">mimicry artist</a>, Saran asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and Saran chose among them, which were added to the film.

"Gemini", with the exception of two songs which were filmed in Switzerland, was shot at AVM Studios. One of the songs, "Penn Oruthi", was shot at <a href="Jungfraujoch">Jungfraujoch</a>, the highest railway station in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Part of the song sequence was filmed on a sledge in Switzerland, making it the second Indian film to have done so after the <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film "<a href="Sangam%20%281964%20Hindi%20film%29">Sangam</a> "(1964). Though there were problems in acquiring permission, executive producer M. S. Guhan persisted. The overseas shoots were arranged by Travel Masters, a Chennai-based company owned by former actor N. Ramji. "Gemini" was completed on schedule and M. Saravanan praised the director, saying, "... we felt like we were working with <a href="S.%20P.%20Muthuraman">S. P. Muthuraman</a> himself, such was Saran's efficiency".

The characters of Gemini and Teja were modelled on "Vellai" Ravi and Chera respectivelyTamil-<a href="Burma">Burma</a> repatriates who settled in <a href="M.%20Bhaktavatsalam">Bhaktavatsalam</a> colony (B.V. Colony) in <a href="Vyasarpadi">Vyasarpadi</a>, North Madras. They were members of rival gangs headed by Benjamin and Subbhaiah respectively. Their rivalry began when Benjamin, a <a href="DYFI">DYFI</a> member, questioned the illegal activities of Subbhaiah who, apart from running a plastics and iron ore business, held <a href="kangaroo%20court">kangaroo court</a>s. When their feud developed into a Christian-Hindu conflict, they recruited jobless men and formed gangs to wage wars against each other. While Subbhaih's nephew Chera became his right-hand man, "Vellai" Ravi became Benjamin's aide. Benjamin and Ravi's gang killed Subbaiah in 1991. A year later, Chera's gang retaliated by killing Benjamin with the help of another gang member, Asaithambi. Another gangster, Kabilan, joined Chera's gang and they killed more than fourteen people to avenge Subbaiah's murder. One of the murders took place inside the <a href="Egmore">Egmore</a> court in early 2000 when Chera's gang killed Ravi's aide Vijayakumar, leading to a police crackdown on the gangsters. Fearing an encounter, both "Vellai" Ravi and Chera decided to give up their lives of crime and reform. The then-DCP of Flower Bazaar, Shakeel Akhter, held the "transition ceremony" in February 2001. "Vellai" Ravi and Chera were re-arrested under <a href="Goonda">Goondas Act</a> during the film's pre-production.

When asked about his fascination for "rowdy themes", Saran said:
The characters of DGP Singaperumal and "Chintai" Jeeva were based on Shakeel Akhter and Vijayakumar respectively. Since the criminals were re-arrested after being given a chance, the initial script had Singaperumal turning villainous during the climax. When Saran felt that the audience would not be kind to him and that it would damage the film, he added another corrupt police officer to do the job while maintaining Singaperumal as a "very strong, good police officer".

The soundtrack album and background score were composed by <a href="Bharathwaj">Bharathwaj</a>. Since making his entry into Tamil films with Saran's directorial debut "Kaadhal Mannan", he has scored the music for most films directed by Saran. The lyrics were written by poet-lyricist <a href="Vairamuthu">Vairamuthu</a>.

"O Podu" was a popular expression among college students in Tamil Nadu. When the director wanted a <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a> for a song, Vairamuthu suggested using the term and building on it. On the director's insistence, the term was then incorporated into and mixed with the title song, resulting in the <a href="item%20number">item number</a> "O Podu". The song was conceived by AVM as a way of reaching out to the masses. The track, picturised on Rani and Vikram and choreographed by Ashok Raja, was sung by <a href="Anuradha%20Sriram">Anuradha Sriram</a>. For the song, Vikram performed "<a href="savu%20koothu">savu koothu</a>", a type of funeral dance common in Tamil Nadu. The lyrics of "Deewana", sung by <a href="Sadhana%20Sargam">Sadhana Sargam</a>, had some <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> words as it was picturised on the heroine, a typical Marwari woman from <a href="Sowcarpet">Sowcarpet</a> for whom Hindi comes naturally. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", Vairamuthu revealed that the track "Naattu Katta" was based on a <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> song.

The songs were well received by the audience and the track "O Podu", in particular, was a hit. Following the song's success, Vikram was greeted everywhere with screams of "O Podu". He was overwhelmed by the response and, having already worked as a voice artist and singer, offered to sing his version of the song to which the producers agreed. According to Vikram, the song was recorded and filmed the same morning, and was added to the soundtrack album a month after its initial release. The film had been completed by then and the additional track was featured during the closing credits. Initially, a small footage featuring Vikram and Kiran was sent to the cinemas for screening during the end credits. However, the audience were dissatisfied with the shortened version of the song and forced theatre owners to rewind the song and play it again. After receiving calls from distributors and theatre owners, the makers eventually sent the entire song.
The album sold more than 100,000 cassettes even before the film released despite rampant piracy. It was one of the biggest hits in Bharathwaj's career and earned him his first <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Director%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Tamil">Filmfare Award</a>. The music also attracted some unexpected reactions. The high-energy track "O Podu" drove youngsters insane; some resorted to violence, enraging villagers in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and damaging public property in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> for fun. The lyrics by Vairamuthu, which are typically in pure Tamil, contained slang and words from other languages like "Deewana" (Hindi). This departure was criticised by film journalist Sreedhar Pillai, who derided the lyrics of "O Podu" as "pure gibberish".

The music received positive reviews from critics. Sify wrote that Bharadwaj's music was the film's only saving grace. Writing for <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff</a>, Pearl stated that the music director was "impressive". Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" said that the song by Anuradha Sriram has given the term "O! Podu!", which has been part of the "local lingo" for years, a "new, crazy dimension". The song enjoyed anthem-like popularity and according to V. Paramesh, a dealer of film music for 23 years, sold like "hot cakes". It earned Ranion whom the song was picturisedthe moniker "O Podu Rani". However, the song's picturisation attracted criticism. In an article that scrutinised and decried the high level of vulgarity depicted in south Indian films, Sudha G. Tilak of "<a href="Tehelka">Tehelka</a>" wrote that hit tracks like "O Podu" were "obvious in their debauched suggestiveness".

In 2009, "<a href="Mid%20Day">Mid Day</a>" wrote, "O podu is still considered the cornerstone of the rambunctious koothu dance". In 2011, "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" labelled the song an "evergreen hit number". Following the <a href="Internet%20phenomena">internet phenomenon</a> of "<a href="Why%20This%20Kolaveri%20Di">Why This Kolaveri Di</a>" in 2011, "O Podu" was featured alongside "<a href="Appadi%20Podu">Appadi Podu</a>", "<a href="Naaka%20Mukka">Naaka Mukka</a>" and "<a href="Ringa%20Ringa">Ringa Ringa</a>" in a small collection of <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian</a> songs that are considered a "national rage" in India.

The film, which was supposed to be released on 14 April 2002 coinciding with the <a href="Tamil%20New%20Year">Tamil New Year</a>, was released two days early on 12 April, apparently to capitalise on weekend collections. "Gemini" was released alongside <a href="Vijay%20%28actor%29">Vijay</a>'s "<a href="Thamizhan">Thamizhan</a>", <a href="Prashanth%20%28actor%29">Prashanth</a>'s "<a href="Thamizh">Thamizh</a>" and <a href="Vijayakanth">Vijayakanth</a>'s "<a href="Raajjiyam">Raajjiyam</a>". The film was released across Tamil Nadu with 104 prints, the most for a Vikram film at the time of release. On the day of release, the film premiered in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> with the hero, heroine, director and producer in attendance. AVM sold the film to distributors for a "reasonable profit" and marketed it aggressively. They organised promotional events at Music World in Chennai's <a href="Spencer%20Plaza">Spencer Plaza</a>, Landmark and Sankara Hall, where Vikram publicised the film <a href="film%20memorabilia">signing autographs</a>. Since "O Podu" was such a hit among children, AVM invited young children to write reviews, and gave away prizes. In 2006, Saran revealed in a conversation with director <a href="S.%20P.%20Jananathan">S. P. Jananathan</a> that his nervousness rendered him sleepless for four days until the film was released.

"Gemini" received mixed reviews from critics. Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" wrote that the "Vikram style" action film was more of a stylised fare as realism was a casualty in many sequences. She added that while the credibility level of the storyline was low, Saran had tried to strike a balance in making a formulaic film. Pearl of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> lauded Saran's "racy" screenplay but found the plot "hackneyed" and reminiscent of Saran's "Amarkalam". The critic declared, ""Gemini" is your typical masala potboiler. And it works." In contrast, Sify was critical of the film and wrote, "Neither exciting nor absorbing "Gemini" is as hackneyed as they get. [...] Saran should be blamed for this inept movie, which has no storyline and has scant regard for logic or sense."

The performance of the lead also earned mixed response. Malathi Rangarajan analysed, "Be it action or sensitive enactment, Vikram lends a natural touch [...] helps "Gemini" score. [..] With his comic streak Mani makes himself a likeable villain." Kalabhavan Mani's mimicry and portrayal of a villain with a comic sense received acclaim from the critics and audience alike. Rediff said, "The highlight in "Gemini" is undoubtedly Kalabhavan Mani's performance. [...] As the paan-chewing Gemini, Vikram, too, delivers a convincing performance." However, Sify found the cast to be the film's major drawback and scrutinised, "Vikram as Gemini is unimpressive [...] Kalabhavan Mani an excellent actor hams as he plays a villain [...] Top character actor Murali is also wasted in the film."

Following the film's success, Vikram was compared with actor Rajinikanth. D. Govardan of "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" wrote, "The film's success has catapulted its hero, Vikram as the most sought after hero after Rajinikanth in the Tamil film industry today". Rajinikanth, who saw the film, met Vikram and praised his performance. Saran told in an interview that Rajinikanth was so impressed with the songs, he predicted the film's success in addition to considering Rathod for a role in his film "<a href="Baba%20%282002%20film%29">Baba</a>" (2002). The film's premise of an outlaw reforming his ways was appreciated. <a href="D.%20Ramanaidu">D. Ramanaidu</a> of <a href="Suresh%20Productions">Suresh Productions</a>the co-producer of the Telugu remakesaid, "The story of a rowdy sheeter turning into a good man is a good theme". In August 2014, "Gemini" was featured in a list of "Top 10 Tamil Gangster Films" compiled by Saraswathi of Rediff.com.

In an article discussing the rise of the gangster-based film becoming a genre in itself, Sreedhar Pillai wrote in a reference to "Gemini": 

"Gemini" was a box office success and became the biggest hit of the year in Tamil. Made on an estimated budget of , the film grossed more than . The film's success was largely attributed to the popularity of the song "O Podu". D. Govardan of "The Economic Times" stated, "A neatly made "masala" (spice) film, with the song O Podu.. as its USP, it took off from day one and has since then not looked back". Vikram, who was a struggling actor for almost a decade, credited "Gemini" as his first real blockbuster. Sreedhar Pillai said that a good story, presentation and peppy music made it a "winning formula" and declared ""Gemini" has been the biggest hit among Tamil films in the last two years". However, the sceptics in the industry dismissed the film's success as a fluke.

The film ran successfully in theatres for more than 125 days. Since most Tamil films released on the preceding Diwali and <a href="Pongal">Pongal</a> were not successful, "Gemini" helped the industry recover. "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" wrote, ""Gemini" has single-handedly revived the Tamil film industry." The box office collections revived the fortunes of theatres that were on the verge of closure. AVM received a letter from the owner of New Cinema, a theatre in <a href="Cuddalore">Cuddalore</a>, who repaid his debts with the revenue the film generated. Abirami Ramanathan, owner of the multiplex <a href="Abhirami%20Mega%20Mall">Abhirami Mega Mall</a>, said that "Gemini"'s success would slow down the rapid closure of theatres from 2,500 to 2,000. Following the success of the film, Saran named his production house "Gemini Productions", under which he produced films including "<a href="Aaru%20%28film%29">Aaru</a>" (2005), "<a href="Vattaram">Vattaram</a>" (2006) and "<a href="Muni%20%28film%29">Muni</a>" (2007).

Encouraged by the film's success and wide-reaching popularity, Saran remade it in <a href="Telugu%20cinema">Telugu</a> as "<a href="Gemeni%20%28film%29">Gemeni</a>". It is the only film Saran made in a language other than Tamil. The remake starred <a href="Daggubati%20Venkatesh">Venkatesh</a> and <a href="Namitha">Namitha</a> in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. <a href="Posani%20Krishna%20Murali">Posani Krishna Murali</a> translated the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by <a href="R.%20P.%20Patnaik">R. P. Patnaik</a>, who reused most of the tunes from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed to repeat the success of the original. In 2013, a <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> remake was reported to have been planned with <a href="Upendra%20%28actor%29">Upendra</a> in the lead, but he dismissed the reports as rumours.

In September 2002, "Gemini" was screened as part of a six-day workshop jointly conducted by the Department of Journalism and Communication and the Mass Communication Alumni Association of the <a href="University%20of%20Madras">University of Madras</a>; it focussed on the impact of cinema on society. A game-based reality show for children, which was aired between 2003–2004, was titled "O Podu". AVM was involved in the show, which was produced by <a href="Vikatan%20Televistas">Vikatan Televistas</a> and directed by Gerald. The show was broadcast for 26 weeks on <a href="Sun%20TV%20%28India%29">Sun TV</a> on Sundays with <a href="Raaghav">Raaghav</a> as its anchor. In September 2003, physical trainer Santosh Kumar played "O Podu" among a range of popular music as part of a dance <a href="aerobics">aerobics</a> session in a fitness camp held for the <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">Indian cricket team</a> at <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>.

When Vikram was signed up as the <a href="brand%20ambassador">brand ambassador</a> of <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> in April 2005, the commercials featured him playing characters from different walks of life. One among them was a "rowdy role", the essence for which was taken from the character Gemini. During the run-up to the 2006 <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election%2C%202006">assembly election</a>, Chennai-based journalist <a href="Gnani%20Sankaran">Gnani Sankaran</a> began a social awareness movement to prevent <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a> and named it "O Podu" as a short form of "Oatu Podu" meaning "cast your vote". The movement urged the electorate to exercise the right to reject candidates under Section <a href="49-O">49-O</a> of The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, wherein a voter, who has decided not to vote for anyone, can record the fact. For this purpose, the people behind "O Podu" also urged the <a href="Election%20Commission%20of%20India">election commission</a> to facilitate a separate button on the <a href="Voting%20machine">electronic voting machine</a>.

During the <a href="2010%20Asia%20Cup">2010 Asia Cup</a>, a <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>n band performed "O Podu" at the <a href="India">India</a> vs. <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> cricket match held in <a href="Dambulla">Dambulla</a>. In July 2011, Vikram inaugurated "Liver 4 Life", an initiative launched by <a href="MIOT%20Hospital">MIOT Hospital</a>s to create awareness of the <a href="Hepatitis%20B%20virus">Hepatitis B virus</a>. As the campaign was targeted at school and college students, the organisers tweaked the term "O Podu" into "B Podu" and made it the event's tagline to capitalise on the song's immense appeal. In a comical sequence in the film, Dhamu's character claims to be an expert of a <a href="Martial%20arts">martial art</a> form named "Maan Karate" ("Maan" means "<a href="Deer">Deer</a>"), which is actually the art of running away like a deer when in danger. The phrase became famous and was used to name the 2014 comedy film "<a href="Maan%20Karate">Maan Karate</a>" because whenever there is a problem in his life, the hero (played by <a href="Sivakarthikeyan">Sivakarthikeyan</a>) fails to face them and runs for cover instead.

Caspian expeditions of the Rus'

The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were military raids undertaken by <a href="Rus%27%20%28people%29">the Rus'</a> between 864 and 1041 on the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> shores, of what are nowadays <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Dagestan">Dagestan</a>, and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. Initially, the Rus' appeared in <a href="Serkland">Serkland</a> in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the <a href="Volga%20trade%20route">Volga trade route</a>, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the <a href="Gorgan">Gorgan</a> region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and more to the west, in <a href="Gilan%20Province">Gilan</a> and <a href="Mazandaran%20Province">Mazandaran</a>, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the <a href="Khazars">Khazars</a> in the <a href="Volga%20Delta">Volga Delta</a>, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle <a href="Volga">Volga</a>.

During their next expedition in 943, the Rus' captured <a href="Barda%2C%20Azerbaijan">Bardha'a</a>, the capital of <a href="Arran%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Arran</a>, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. <a href="Sviatoslav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Sviatoslav</a>, prince of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea taking place in 1041 by <a href="Ingvar%20the%20Far-Travelled">Ingvar the Far-Travelled</a>.

The Rus' first penetrated to the Muslim areas adjacent to the Caspian Sea as traders rather than warriors. By the early 9th century, the <a href="Norsemen">Norsemen</a> settled in northwestern Russia, where they established a settlement called <a href="Staraya%20Ladoga">Aldeigja</a> (Slavic: "Ladoga") about south of the <a href="Volkhov%20River">Volkhov River</a> entry into <a href="Lake%20Ladoga">Lake Ladoga</a>. From there, they began trading with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> along the <a href="trade%20route%20from%20the%20Varangians%20to%20the%20Greeks">Dnieper trade route</a> and with the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> lands around the Caspian Sea along the <a href="Volga%20trade%20route">Volga trade route</a>. In the late 9th century, <a href="ibn%20Khordadbeh">ibn Khordadbeh</a> described the Rus' buying goods from the Khazars in the market areas on the lower <a href="Volga%20River">Volga</a> and selling them on the markets of Caspian towns; these merchants brought furs, honey, and slaves. Small groups of the Rus' even went on camels as far as <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> to sell their goods; their European slaves interpreted for them.

<a href="Thomas%20S.%20Noonan">Thomas S. Noonan</a> suggested that the Rus' reached Baghdad as early as 800; this argument is supported by the finding of <a href="Sassanid">Sassanid</a>, <a href="Arab">Arab</a>, and Arabo-Sassanid <a href="dirham">dirham</a> coins dated no later than 804–805 at <a href="Peterhof%20Palace">Peterhof</a>, near <a href="Saint-Petersburg">Saint-Petersburg</a>. In ibn Khordadbeh's account, the Rus' are described as "a kind of the <a href="Saqaliba">Saqaliba</a>", a term usually used to refer to <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>, and anti-Normanist scholars have interpreted this passage as indicative of the Rus' being Slavs rather than <a href="Norsemen">Scandinavians</a>. In the interpretation of the Normanist scholars, the word "Saqaliba" was also frequently applied to all fair-haired, ruddy-complexioned populations of <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern</a>, and <a href="Northeastern%20Europe">Northeastern Europe</a>, so ibn Khordadbeh's language is ambiguous here.

The first Caspian raid of the Rus' occurred sometime in the reign of <a href="Hasan%20ibn%20Zaid">Hasan ibn Zaid</a>, ruler of <a href="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a> between 864 and 884. The Rus' sailed into the Caspian Sea and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at <a href="Abaskun">Abaskun</a>. This raid was probably on a very small scale. The second raid took place in 909 or 910 and was likewise aimed at Abaskun; just like the previous attack, this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it. The third minor raid took place in 911 or 912.

The Rus' launched the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern shores of the Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through the land of the Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper River</a> into the Black Sea, then into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a>, then up the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don River</a> past the Khazar city of <a href="Sarkel">Sarkel</a>, and then by a <a href="portage">portage</a> reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.

The Rus' attacked in the <a href="Gorgan">Gorgan</a> region around Abaskun, as well as <a href="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a>, pillaging the countrysides as they went. An attempt to repel them as they lay in anchor near islands in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea proved unsuccessful; and they were then able to roam and raid at will. Across the sea they raided at <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, penetrating inland a distance of three days' journey, and plundering the regions of <a href="Arran%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Arran</a>, Tabaristan, <a href="Beylagan">Beylagan</a>, and <a href="Shirvan">Shirvan</a>. Everywhere they looted as much as they could, taking women and children as slaves. The news of their outrages preceded them as they headed homeward and, in the <a href="Volga%20Delta">Volga Delta</a>, the Rus' were attacked by Khazars, as well as by some Christians, apparently with the acquiescence of the Khazar ruler. According to <a href="al-Masudi">al-Masudi</a>, those who escaped were finished off by the <a href="Burtas">Burtas</a> and <a href="Volga%20Bulgars">Volga Bulgars</a>.

The second large-scale campaign is dated to 943, when <a href="Igor%20of%20Kiev">Igor</a> was the supreme leader of the Rus', according to the <a href="Primary%20Chronicle">Primary Chronicle</a>. During the 943 expedition, the Rus' rowed up the <a href="Kura%20%28Caspian%20Sea%29">Kura River</a>, deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of <a href="Marzuban%20bin%20Muhammad">Marzuban bin Muhammad</a>, and captured <a href="Bardha%27a">Bardha'a</a>, the capital of Arran. The Rus' allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; it is possible that the Rus' intended to settle permanently there. According to <a href="ibn%20Miskawaih">ibn Miskawaih</a>, the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus', who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus' began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down. The Rus' stayed in Bardha'a for several months, using it as a base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils.

The city was saved only by an outbreak of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> among the Rus'. Ibn Miskawaih writes that the Rus' "indulged excessively in the fruit of which there are numerous sorts there. This produced an epidemic among them . . . and their numbers began thereby to be reduced." Encouraged by the epidemic among the Rus', the Muslims approached the city. The Rus', their chief riding on a donkey, made an unsuccessful sally after which they lost 700 warriors, but evaded encirclement and retreated to the Bardha'a fortress, where they were besieged by the Muslims. Exhausted by the disease and the siege, the Rus' "left by night the fortress in which they had established their quarters, carrying on their backs all they could of their treasure, gems, and fine raiment, boys and girls as they wanted, and made for the Kura River, where the ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews, and 300 Russes whom they had been supporting with portions of their booty." The Muslims then exhumed from the Rus' graves the weapons that had been buried beside the warriors.

<a href="George%20Vernadsky">George Vernadsky</a> proposed that <a href="Oleg%20of%20Novgorod">Oleg of Novgorod</a> was the donkey-riding chief of the Rus' who attacked Bardha'a. Vernadsky identified Oleg with "Helgu", a figure mentioned in the <a href="Schechter%20Letter">Schechter Letter</a>. According to that document, Helgu went to <a href="Persia">Persia</a> by boat and died there <a href="Rus%27-Byzantine%20War%20%28941%29">after a failed attack</a> on <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 941. On the other hand, <a href="Lev%20Gumilev">Lev Gumilev</a>, drawing on the name of the Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was <a href="Sveneld">Sveneld</a>, a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in the <a href="Primary%20Chronicle">Primary Chronicle</a> under 945.

The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between <a href="Khazaria">Khazaria</a> and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Byzantine incitement also apparently played a role. Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of <a href="Romanus%20I%20Lecapenus">Romanus I Lecapenus</a>, who persecuted the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s of his empire. According to the <a href="Schechter%20Letter">Schechter Letter</a>, the Khazar ruler <a href="Joseph%20%28Khazar%29">Joseph</a> responded to the persecution of Jews by "doing away with many <a href="Christians">Christians</a>" and Romanus retaliated by inciting <a href="Oleg%20of%20Novgorod">Oleg of Novgorod</a> (called "Helgu" in the letter) against Khazaria.

The conflict may also have been spurred by the Khazars' decision to close passage down the Volga in response to the raid of 943. In the <a href="Khazar%20Correspondence">Khazar Correspondence</a>, written around 950–960, the Khazar ruler Joseph reported his role as defender of the Muslim polities of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> region against Rus' incursions: "I have to wage war with them [Rus], for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>." Earlier conflict between Muslim elements of the Khazar army and Rus' marauders in c. 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and the hostility of the Rus' against Khazaria.

In 965, <a href="Sviatoslav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Sviatoslav I of Kiev</a> finally went to war against <a href="Khazaria">Khazaria</a>. He employed <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Oghuz</a> and <a href="Pecheneg">Pecheneg</a> mercenaries in this campaign, perhaps to counter the Khazars' superior <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>. Sviatoslav destroyed the Khazar city of <a href="Sarkel">Sarkel</a> around 965, and possibly sacked (but did not occupy) the Khazar city of <a href="Kerch">Kerch</a> on the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a>. He subsequently (probably in 968 or 969) destroyed the Khazar capital of <a href="Atil">Atil</a>. A visitor to Atil wrote soon after Sviatoslav's campaign: "The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch." <a href="Ibn%20Hawqal">Ibn Hawqal</a> is the only author who reports the sack of <a href="Samandar%20%28city%29">Semender</a>, after which the Rus' departed for "<a href="R%C3%BBm">Rûm</a> and <a href="al-Andaluz">al-Andaluz</a>". 

Sviatoslav's campaign brought the prosperity and independence of Khazaria to an abrupt end. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the <a href="Saltovo-Mayaki">Saltovo-Mayaki</a> culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.

In 987, Maymun, <a href="emir">emir</a> of <a href="Derbent">Derbent</a>, asked the Rus' to help him against local chiefs. The Rus', many of whom appear to have been professional soldiers, arrived on 18 ships. Uncertain of their reception, they sent only one ship to reconnoitre the situation. When its crew were massacred by the local population, the Rus' went on to loot the city of Maskat. In 989, this same Maymun is reported to have refused the demand of a local preacher to turn over his Rus' mercenaries to him for either conversion to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> or death. In the ensuing struggle, Maymun was driven from the city and forced to surrender the Rus' soldiers, but he returned in 992.

In 1030, the Rus' raided the region of Shirvan; the ruler of <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a> then paid them much money to help suppress a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus' raid into Shirvan; they were joined by the <a href="Alans">Alans</a> and <a href="Sarir">Sarir</a>. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. <a href="Omeljan%20Pritsak">Omeljan Pritsak</a> suggests that they operated out of a base near the <a href="Terek%20River">Terek</a> estuary and had their principal home in <a href="Tmutarakan">Tmutarakan</a>. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Oghuz</a> in a power struggle in <a href="Khwarezm">Khwarezm</a>.

in 1042 Ingvar the Far-Travelled
led an unsuccessful large Viking attack against Persia with a fleet of 200 ships (around 15-20 thousand men).

The <a href="legendary%20saga">legendary saga</a> "<a href="Yngvars%20saga%20v%C3%AD%C3%B0f%C3%B6rla">Yngvars saga víðförla</a>" describes the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly connected with the <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a>-Byzantine <a href="Battle%20of%20Sasireti">Battle of Sasireti</a> in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> by <a href="Ingvar%20the%20Far-Travelled">Ingvar the Far-Travelled</a>, who went down the Volga into the land of the <a href="Saracens">Saracens</a> ("<a href="Serkland">Serkland</a>" in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six <a href="Ingvar%20Runestones">Ingvar Runestones</a>, twenty-three of them being in the Lake <a href="M%C3%A4laren">Mälaren</a> region of <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a> in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and Caspian seas.

<a href="Khaqani">Khaqani</a> tells about the invasion of Shirvan in 1173 or 1174. In his odes, Khaqani names the Rus' and Khazars, Rus' and Alans, Rus' and Sarir as the invaders. <a href="Peter%20Benjamin%20Golden">Peter Golden</a> argued that the Rus' mentioned by Khaqani were <a href="Ushkuiniks">Volga pirates</a> who came in 73 ships. <a href="Yevgeni%20Pakhomov">Yevgeni Pakhomov</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Minorsky">Vladimir Minorsky</a> thought the invasion was initiated by the ruler of Darbent, Bek-Bars b. Muzaffar.

James Robert Baker

James Robert Baker (October 18, 1947 – November 5, 1997) was an <a href="American%20literature">American author</a> of sharply satirical, predominantly gay-themed <a href="transgressional%20fiction">transgressional fiction</a>. A native Californian, his work is set almost entirely in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>. After graduating from <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, he began his career as a screenwriter, but became disillusioned and started writing novels instead. Though he garnered fame for his books "Fuel-Injected Dreams" and "<a href="Boy%20Wonder%20%28novel%29">Boy Wonder</a>", after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, "<a href="Tim%20and%20Pete">Tim and Pete</a>", he faced increasing difficulty having his work published. According to his <a href="life%20partner">life partner</a>, this was a contributing factor in his death by suicide.

Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. His novel "<a href="Testosterone%20%28novel%29">Testosterone</a>" was adapted to a <a href="Testosterone%20%282003%20film%29">film of the same name</a>, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.

Baker was born in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> and raised in what he considered a "stifling, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Southern Californian household". Rebelling against his parents, he became attracted to the fringe elements of society, including <a href="beatnik">beatnik</a>s (anyone living as a <a href="bohemianism">bohemian</a>, acting rebelliously, or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners), artists and gays. In high school during the 1960s he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs, while living in fear that his abusive father would find out. At one point, his father hired a private detective to follow him, when he suspected Baker was having an affair with a male neighbor. This family dynamic would be used in many of his novels, most extensively in "Boy Wonder".

Baker began taking drugs, and became, in his own words, "an out of control, teenage speed freak". He also began drinking heavily, attributing it to the fact that he was <a href="closeted">closeted</a>. However, even after <a href="coming%20out">coming out</a>, his substance abuse remained excessive and "still had a life of its own". After sobering up, he attended <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a> film school, where he was one of the winners of the <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Writing%20Awards">Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards</a>, and directed two films: "Mouse Klub Konfidential" and "Blonde Death". "Mouse Klub Konfidential", a film about a <a href="Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">Mickey Mouse Club</a> Mouseketeer who becomes a gay <a href="bondage%20%28BDSM%29">bondage</a> pornographer, was a controversial entry in the 1976 San Francisco's <a href="Frameline%20Film%20Festival">LGBT Film Festival</a>, as some thought Baker was actually advocating <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. It is also credited with having caused <a href="Michael%20Medved">Michael Medved</a> to abandon his dream of film making and instead become a film critic.

Baker's lifelong ambition was to write. Upon graduating from UCLA, he spent approximately five years writing Hollywood screenplays in the early 1980s, a process he hated. While financially successful, he was frustrated that his work was not being produced. "I felt like a door-to-door salesman going to all these [story] pitch meetings ... [filled with] rabid, hideous morons".

Turning his attention to novels, his first book, "Adrenaline", was published under the pseudonym James Dillinger. A story of two gay fugitive lovers on the run, it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books. Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works: anarchy; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men; the dark underside of Los Angeles, juxtaposed with its sunny outward image; the hypocrisy of organized religion; anonymous sex and its implications in the age of AIDS; and homophobia and the oppression of gays in a Republican dominated America. Its <a href="plot%20device">plot device</a> of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one Baker explored in all of his subsequent work. The modest success of this novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works, "Fuel-Injected Dreams" (a novel revolving around a character loosely based on record producer <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>) and the 1986 release "Boy Wonder". After the novel was published, he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books. He spent the bulk of each day writing and researching, and acted out characters and scenes of his novels on videotape to perfect the dialogue.

His primary focus was gay-themed writing, though he also wrote about the entertainment industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican <a href="Neoconservatism">neo-con</a> agenda, especially after the <a href="AIDS%20pandemic">AIDS pandemic</a> began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in <a href="gay%20literature">gay literature</a>, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary community as well as the gay community itself.

A self-described <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a>, Baker has been categorized as a writer of <a href="transgressional%20fiction">transgressional fiction</a>, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, <a href="nihilism">nihilistic</a> characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, <a href="necrophilia">necrophilia</a> and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from <a href="Proust">Proust</a> to <a href="Jim%20Thompson%20%28writer%29">Jim Thompson</a> and <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>. He also admired the punk writer <a href="Dennis%20Cooper">Dennis Cooper</a>.

His work is filled with pop cultural references to both film and music, as well as politics. <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>' "<a href="Touch%20of%20Evil">Touch of Evil</a>" and <a href="John%20Ford">John Ford</a>'s "<a href="The%20Searchers%20%28film%29">The Searchers</a>" are mentioned prominently in more than one of his books, and <a href="Roxy%20Music">Roxy Music</a> is referenced in virtually every novel he wrote. The imagery in his novels is largely cinematic, with expressions such as "<a href="fade%20%28filmmaking%29">fade in/fade out</a>", "<a href="cut%20%28transition%29">quick cut</a>" and "<a href="VistaVision">VistaVision</a>"; and sentences such as "a <a href="montage%20%28filmmaking%29">montage</a> traces the next fifteen years" and "If the last <a href="Film%20reel">reel</a> of Cheryl's life had been a <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> movie ...".

Baker's work received mixed reviews. His only two books not specifically gay themed (though containing gay characters and a somewhat gay sensibility), "Boy Wonder" and "Fuel-Injected Dreams", were better received by critics, and more popular with readers, though he was never a bestselling novelist. Baker himself estimated that his books sold approximately 25,000 copies each. His following book, however, "Tim and Pete", met with hostile reviews, primarily for its advocacy of political assassination and terror tactics in combating <a href="AIDS%20Discrimination">AIDS discrimination</a>. Baker himself was ambivalent on the subject. "I think assassination does change things ... But I'm not really calling for violence," he said. "It's a novel, not a position paper."

In a 1993 interview, however, Baker stated:
I think a strong case can be made that political assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making <a href="gay%20bashing">bashing gays</a> their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating <a href="People%20With%20AIDS">PWA's</a> turn themselves into human bombs, but on the other hand I have to admit that if I clicked on <a href="CNN">CNN</a> and heard somebody had blown <a href="Patrick%20Buchanan">Patrick Buchanan</a>'s head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.

There were also charges of racism, due to his portrayals of blacks and Hispanics. Baker denied those charges, and pointed out that the protagonist later realized that the blacks were also gay and the Latina "was just a sweet old woman putting up with a lot of (stuff) that I couldn't even imagine." He went on to say, "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks ... the real feelings [and the] misapprehensions of each other. I realized it wouldn't all be nice and politically correct. If blacks (and Latinos) want my respect, they have to deal with their own homophobia. I'm not playing guilty liberal anymore".

The book caused a great deal of controversy among critics, with some calling it "irresponsible", and saying it was "determined to give offense" and "appears to endorse violence". One critic of the book wrote, "The work rapidly becomes an apology for political terrorism and effectively advocates the assassination of the entire American New Right. While the reasons for such a vengeance motif are perhaps evident, can it really be countenanced? Are we still justified in referring to this as art? And even if we are, is there a point at which such invective (and such suggestions) become simply counterproductive?"
Another critic, however, called it "a masterful creation" and wrote:
"In coming years Baker will be seen as having understood the implications of this period in our history while the rest of us were simply living it". It polarized the reading public as well, with letters to the editor of major newspapers both supporting and opposing Baker's ideology. Baker himself was aware that the book would be controversial, and deliberately provoked much of the reaction he received. He said:
""Tim and Pete" tries to convey in print what people really think rather than what they should think or what's P.C. My fantasy was to leave readers so infuriated they'd throw down the book and march right out to a gun store because they wanted to see the finale so bad they realize the only way it'd happen is if they make it happen in real life!"

After the reception of "Tim and Pete", with several critics calling him "The Last Angry Gay Man", Baker faced increasing difficulty finding a publisher for his work and his financial position became precarious. He was only able to publish one novella, "Right Wing", and that was self-published on the Internet.

Baker's <a href="life%20partner">life partner</a>, Ron Robertson, believes that this difficulty led Baker on a quick, downwards emotional spiral. Baker <a href="suicide">killed himself</a> at his home on November 5, 1997, by asphyxiation in his garage. His death was noted in literary circles and mainstream press; the "<a href="Gay%20Times">Gay Times</a>" in the United Kingdom wrote, "Baker's suicide is particularly tragic because it robs American gay writing of a refreshingly distinctive voice quite unlike the <a href="%3Awikt%3Apo-faced">po-faced</a> prose of so many of his contemporaries."

Since his death, Baker's reputation has steadily increased among critics and the reading public; and his works now have cult status in the literary community. By 2006, <a href="Edition%20%28book%29%23First%20edition">first editions</a> of "Adrenaline", "Boy Wonder", "Fuel-Injected Dreams" and "Tim and Pete" had become collector's items and commanded high prices at rare book stores.

Robertson, now Baker's literary executor, was successful in having two additional novels published after Baker's death. One of those, "Testosterone", was filmed in 2003. Directed by David Moreton and starring <a href="Antonio%20Sabato%20Jr.">Antonio Sabato Jr.</a>, the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure. Both "Boy Wonder" and "Fuel-Injected Dreams" have been optioned for the movies several times, most recently in 2004, though they were never produced. Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.

Though "Tim and Pete" was his most controversial work, "Boy Wonder" is generally considered his "<a href="masterpiece">magnum opus</a>", and remains his most popular book. A black satire of the film industry, it is also a parody of the "oral biographies" popularized by <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> with his books about <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a> and <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>, in that the protagonist's life is revealed in the form of interviews between the writer and the characters. Though it has been praised as "one of the few novels from the last couple of decades that could justifiably be called a classic", reviewers have also pointed out that it is probably unfilmable due to its bitter cynicism regarding the movie industry.

Baker's last published work, "Right Wing", as well as his posthumous novels "Testosterone" and "Anarchy", represent a stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, and in the case of "Anarchy", partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. "Testosterone" needed only minor changes, while "Anarchy" underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.

Three of Baker's books have thus far not been published: "White Devils", "Proto Punk", and "Crucifying Todd". Additionally, he wrote two screenplays which have not as yet been filmed: "Inez" and "Desert Women".

Tropical Storm Carrie (1972)

Tropical Storm Carrie was a strong tropical storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early September 1972. The third <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="1972%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1972 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> into the Atlantic in the middle of August. Tracking generally northward throughout its life, Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status. The storm began to reintensify in a <a href="Baroclinity">baroclinic environment</a> after turning toward the northwest; its winds of as it was transitioning into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical system</a> eclipsed the cyclone's previous maximum strength. The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern <a href="New%20England">New England</a> before making landfall in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> on September 4 and dissipating over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Saint%20Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a> during the next two days.

Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached and rainfall exceeded . Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. Overall damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1,780,000, and four deaths are blamed on the storm.

The origins of Tropical Storm Carrie are traced back to a tropical wave—an elongated area of <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low atmospheric air pressure</a>—that emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 15, 1972. A relatively strong weather system, the wave progressed westward, but by the time it had reached the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a> ten days later, it had degenerated substantially. The influence of a nearby <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level</a> low pressure system caused the disturbance to further deteriorate, and the resultant remnant circulation drifted toward the northwest; by August 28, it was situated at a position just offshore southeastern <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. The low pressure system maintained a <a href="cold-core%20low">cold core</a> and had not yet established itself at the surface. On August 29, the low began moving northward in response to an approaching <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>. For the first time, a low-level circulation center had been identified in association with the system, and the storm became a tropical depression at 1200 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> while located east of the central Florida peninsula. The depression tracked steadily northeastward as it gradually intensified.

On August 31, <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> aircraft flying into the cyclone reported <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">maximum sustained winds</a> of up to around . Post-storm reanalysis estimated the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm at around 0000 UTC on August 31. Operationally, however, it was not recognized as such until 2200 UTC that day, when it was assigned the name Carrie. At the time, the system was located approximately east of <a href="Cape%20Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</a>. A small storm, Carrie slowed drastically in forward movement as it curved northward. By the time it was identified as a tropical storm in real-time, Carrie had already reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">central pressure</a> of , and strong <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> inhibited immediate strengthening as it continue to slow to a drift. On September 1, Carrie began to weaken, and by early on September 2, it had dwindled to a minimal tropical storm with winds of only . Satellite imagery indicated that the storm's center of circulation had become distorted with little or no associated <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>. At its weakest, the storm's highest winds were found far from the center, likely generated more by the increasing <a href="pressure%20gradient">pressure gradient</a> in relation to an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> to the north than by the low pressure center itself.

A low pressure system moving through the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> pulled Carrie northwest, back toward the United States East Coast, at an accelerated forward speed. Later on September 2, the storm had begun to show signs of reorganization, including an improved appearance on satellite imagery and the development of some thunderstorm activity, although significant reintensification was considered unlikely. However, with the advance of a trough embedded in the westerlies, Carrie quickly deepened under the influence of <a href="baroclinity">baroclinic processes</a>. While the storm's maximum sustained winds increased, it also began to shed its tropical characteristics and resemble an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a>. Moving once again toward the north-northeast, Carrie was declared extratropical by the National Hurricane Center during the late afternoon on September 2. In the official <a href="HURDAT">Atlantic Hurricane Database</a>, however, Carrie is listed as a tropical cyclone until 1800 UTC on September 3, at which point it possessed winds of and a central barometric pressure of . As a result, these data are considered representative of the storm's peak intensity. Regardless of its status, the storm was a large and intense system as it progressed north and neared <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, generating strong winds and rough surf along the coast. Having fully transitioned into an extratropical system, the storm made landfall near <a href="Eastport%2C%20Maine">Eastport, Maine</a> on September 4 and slowly weakened as it continued north up the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The cyclone fully dissipated on September 6 in the Gulf.

The pressure gradient between Carrie and the <a href="anticyclone">high pressure area</a> to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds, and by extension high seas. In response, the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> issued <a href="small%20craft%20advisory">small craft warnings</a> starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the <a href="Carolinas">Carolinas</a>. <a href="Gale%20warning">Gale warning</a>s were posted the next day from southern <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> to the coast of central New England, and the small craft warnings were brought north to Maine. Ongoing, as well as the threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of <a href="flash%20flood%20watch">flash flood watch</a>es throughout eastern Massachusetts, southeastern <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, and southern and central Maine on September 3. Due to rough surf, the beach at <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a> was closed to swimmers on August 31.

Carrie had minimal effects on the East Coast south of the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, limited to moderate winds and generally light rainfall. Precipitation at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> reached between September 1 and 3, and pressure fell to a modest . Sustained winds were recorded at , with only slightly higher gusts, although the <a href="Chesapeake%20Light">Chesapeake Light</a> unofficially reported gusts to near . Damage in the area was minimal with the exception of <a href="coastal%20erosion">beach erosion</a>, and tides above normal triggered minor flooding. Moderate rainfall, approaching or reaching , fell across the southern <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a>. Equally minor effects were felt in the <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, area, with comparable or even less significant reports of winds and rainfall and damages limited to coastal flooding and beach erosion. Since the adverse weather conditions fell on a portion of the <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend, the local resort industry suffered economical losses.

The brunt of the storm occurred in southeastern New England, particularly coastal Massachusetts, where strong gusts battered the shore. The distribution of winds resulting from the storm more closely resembled that of a <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a> than a cyclone of tropical origin, in which the wind field would typically be concentrated closer to its center. Instead, the strongest winds remained well removed from the center of circulation, but were nonetheless severe; gusts reached at <a href="Point%20Judith%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Point Judith, Rhode Island</a>, and on <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>, Massachusetts. Sustained winds throughout the region were generally below . In <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, Massachusetts, winds gusted to . The storm brought down trees and powerlines, blocking roads and damaging property. Structural damage was also evident, especially to buildings under construction, and an entire cottage in <a href="Rockland%2C%20Maine">Rockland, Maine</a> was blown off its foundation.

Rainfall in southeastern New England was heavy, locally exceeding . On the island of <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, a storm total of was reported, the highest known precipitation sum resulting from Carrie. The most torrential rains were usually confined to within of the coast. The deluge swelled streams, inundated cellars, and washed out a railroad near <a href="Eagle%20Lake%2C%20Maine">Eagle Lake, Maine</a>, derailing a train. Along the coast, rough surf caused beach erosion and swamped hundreds of small craft. On September 3, choppy conditions forced the suspension of steamship services to and from the mainland and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>. Thousands of tourists and seasonal residents became stranded on the islands, creating what officials described as a "logistical problem". During the height of the storm, around 20,000 <a href="Narragansett%20Electric%20Company">Narragansett Electric Company</a> customers lost power, with scattered power outages reported elsewhere throughout New England.

In general, damage from Tropical Storm Carrie and its extratropical remnants was light. Total monetary damage was estimated at $1,780,000 in 1972 terms, of which $1,200,000 in losses was inflicted on Massachusetts. Losses totaled $350,000 in Rhode Island, $200,000 in Maine, and $30,000 in New Hampshire. Four fatalities were attributed to the storm: two in the aftermath of boating accidents in Massachusetts, and two due to rough surf along the coast of Maine. In the aftermath, a local disaster area was declared for the town of <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Plymouth</a>. The weakening remnants of Carrie produced strong winds throughout <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> on September 5 and 6, peaking at . In <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Saint John</a>, where wind gusts reached , there were reports of downed telephone wires and trees. Widespread power outages occurred throughout communities in the province. Only light rain fell in Saint John, and no flooding was evident. The storm damaged or destroyed numerous boats in <a href="Charlo%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Charlo, New Brunswick</a>.

Oceanic currents produced by the storm washed cells of the harmful alga "<a href="Alexandrium%20fundyense">Alexandrium fundyense</a>" south and west into the coastal waters of New England. The alga releases toxins that cause shellfish poisoning and is native to the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a>. Several weeks after the storm, a massive bloom of the alga occurred offshore the northeastern United States for the first time, and the species bloomed every year post-Carrie.

Chalciporus piperatus

Chalciporus piperatus, commonly known as the peppery bolete, is a small pored <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a> of the family <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a> found in mixed woodland in Europe and North America. It has been recorded under <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> trees in Brazil, and has become <a href="naturalization%20%28biology%29">naturalised</a> in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and spread under native "<a href="Nothofagus%20cunninghamii">Nothofagus cunninghamii</a>" trees. A small bolete, the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> has a orange-fawn <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> with cinnamon to brown pores underneath, and a high by thick <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. The rare <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "hypochryseus", found only in Europe, has yellow pores and tubes.

Described by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> in 1790 as "Boletus piperatus", it is only distantly related to other members of the genus "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>" and was reclassified as "Chalciporus piperatus" by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bataille">Frédéric Bataille</a> in 1908. The genus "<a href="Chalciporus">Chalciporus</a>" was an early branching <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a> in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> properties. Previously thought to be <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>l (a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic relationship</a> that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), "C. piperatus" is now suspected of being <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> on "<a href="Amanita%20muscaria">Amanita muscaria</a>". The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> of "C. piperatus" has a very peppery taste, and can be used as a condiment or flavouring.

French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Pierre Bulliard</a> described the species as "Boletus piperatus" in 1790. In its <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, it has been transferred to the genera "<a href="Leccinum">Leccinum</a>" (<a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a>, 1821), "Viscipellis" (<a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a>, 1886), "Ixocomus" (Quélet, 1888), "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" (<a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>, 1898), and "Ceriomyces" (<a href="William%20Alphonso%20Murrill">William Alphonso Murrill</a>, 1909). It was reclassified and given its current <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> name in 1908 by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bataille">Frédéric Bataille</a> when he made it the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the newly circumscribed genus "Chalciporus". The <a href="botanical%20name">species name</a> "piperatus" means "peppery" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. It is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "peppery bolete".

"Chalciporus piperatus" is a member of the genus "<a href="Chalciporus">Chalciporus</a>", with which the genus "<a href="Buchwaldoboletus">Buchwaldoboletus</a>" form a group of fungi that is an early offshoot in the <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a>. Many members of the group appear to be <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a>.

Two <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> have been described. "Chalciporus piperatus" var. "hypochryseus" was originally described as "Boletus hypochryseus" by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993, and was moved to "Chalciporus" a year later by Regis Courtecuisse. Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of "C. piperatus" in 2006, although some sources continue to regard it as a distinct species. Variety "amarellus", first published by Quélet as "Boletus amarellus" in 1883 and later transferred to "Chalciporus" by Bataille in 1908, was described as a variety of "C. piperatus" in 1974 by <a href="Albert%20Pil%C3%A1t">Albert Pilát</a> and <a href="Aurel%20Dermek">Aurel Dermek</a>. Authorities disagree as to whether or not it has independent taxonomic significance.

One of the smaller boletes, "Chalciporus piperatus " has an orange-fawn <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> that is initially convex before flattening out in age. The cap surface can be furrowed; shiny when dry, it can be a little sticky when wet. The colour of the pore surface ranges from cinnamon to dark reddish brown in maturity. When bruised, the pore surface stains brown. Individual pores are angular, measuring about 0.5–2 mm wide, while the tubes are 3–10 mm deep. Slender for a bolete, the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> measures long by thick, and is either roughly the same width throughout its length, or slightly thicker near the base. The colour of the stem is similar to the cap, or lighter, and there is yellow <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> at the base. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is yellow, sometimes with reddish tones, maturing to purplish brown. It has no odour. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is brown to cinnamon. Variety "hypochryseus" is essentially identical to the main form except for its bright yellow tubes and pores. Variety "amarellus" has pinker pores and a taste that is bitter rather than peppery.

The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are smooth, narrowly fusiform (fuse-shaped), and measure 7–12 by 3–5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8 µm and are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are fusiform, sometimes with a rounded tip, and have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12 µm. Some are more or less hyaline, while others are encrusted with a golden pigment. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17 µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are absent from the hyphae.

The fruit body of the North American species "<a href="Chalciporus%20piperatoides">Chalciporus piperatoides</a>" are similar, but can be distinguished by its flesh and pores staining blue after cutting or bruising. It has a less peppery taste. Another mild-tasting relative, "<a href="Chalciporus%20rubinellus">C. rubinellus</a>", has brighter colours than "C. piperatus", including completely red tubes. One European species, "<a href="Chalciporus%20rubinus">C. rubinus</a>", has a shape similar to "C. piperatus", but has red pores and a stem covered in red dots.

Fruit bodies of "Chalciporus piperatus" occur singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground. The fungus occurs naturally in or near <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> or <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a> <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, often on sandy soils. Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November. The fungus is widespread across North America, fruiting from July to October in the eastern states and from September to January on the Pacific Coast. It is found in Mexico and Central America. In Asia, it has been collected from Pakistan, <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> (India), and <a href="Guangdong%20Province">Guangdong Province</a> (China). In South Africa, it is known from the southwestern <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> and the eastern <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal Province</a>.

"Chalciporus piperatus" grows in conifer plantations associated with the fly agaric ("<a href="Amanita%20muscaria">Amanita muscaria</a>") and the chanterelle ("<a href="Cantharellus%20cibarius">Cantharellus cibarius</a>"). It has been recorded under introduced loblolly pine ("<a href="Pinus%20taeda">Pinus taeda</a>") plantations in <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a> and <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a> states in southern Brazil, and under introduced trees in the <a href="Los%20Lagos%20Region">Los Lagos Region</a> of Chile. It has also spread into native forest in northeastern <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and Victoria, having been found growing with the native myrtle beech ("<a href="Nothofagus%20cunninghamii">Nothofagus cunninghamii</a>"). The rare variety "hypochryseus" occurs only in Europe, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Also rare, variety "amarellus" is widespread in European coniferous forests, where it usually found near <a href="pine">pine</a>s, <a href="spruce">spruce</a>, and sometimes <a href="fir">fir</a>.

Fruit bodies can be parasitised by the mould "<a href="Sepedonium%20chalcipori">Sepedonium chalcipori</a>", a highly specialised <a href="mycoparasitism">mycoparasite</a> that is only known to infect this bolete. Infections result in <a href="necrosis">necrotic</a> mushroom tissue and the production of copious yellow <a href="conidia">conidia</a>.

Initially thought to be <a href="ectomycorrhizal">ectomycorrhizal</a> (<a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> with plants, like most Boletaceae), "C. piperatus" has not been confirmed as such in multiple synthesis studies or in <a href="isotope%20fractionation">isotope fractionation</a> studies. There is some speculation that "C. piperatus" is a mycoparasite on the mycorrhiza of "Amanita muscaria". In New Zealand, "A. muscaria" is thought to have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> with "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>", and has made a <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> jump to the native "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>" trees; "C. piperatus" has since been observed fruiting near "Nothofagus" trees with "A. muscaria" associations. "<a href="Buchwaldoboletus%20lignicola">Buchwaldoboletus lignicola</a>" is in the same <a href="clade">clade</a> as "C. piperatus" and is thought to be a parasite as well, strengthening the evidence that "C. piperatus" and its relatives may be mycoparasites.

This mushroom is edible but very peppery. The Italian chef <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a> recommends only using it to add flavour to other mushrooms. It has been used as a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify "C. piperatus" as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for <a href="mushroom%20dye">mushroom dye</a>ing; depending on the <a href="mordant">mordant</a> used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.

<a href="Sclerocitrin">Sclerocitrin</a>, a <a href="biological%20pigment">pigment</a> compound originally isolated from the common earthball ("<a href="Scleroderma%20citrinum">Scleroderma citrinum</a>"), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of "C. piperatus" fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include <a href="norbadione%20A">norbadione A</a>, <a href="chalciporone">chalciporone</a>, <a href="xerocomic%20acid">xerocomic acid</a>, <a href="variegatic%20acid">variegatic acid</a>, <a href="variegatorubin">variegatorubin</a>, and another yellow pigment, <a href="chalcitrin">chalcitrin</a>. Chalciporone is responsible for the bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadione A are derived <a href="biosynthesis">biosynthetically</a> from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.

A field study of fungi growing in polluted sites in the Czech and Slovak Republics found that "C. piperatus" fruit bodies growing near lead <a href="smelting">smelters</a> and on mine and <a href="slag">slag</a> dumps had the greatest ability to <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a> the element <a href="antimony">antimony</a>. In one collection, an "extremely high" level of the element was detected—1423 milligrams of antimony per kilogram of dried mushroom. In comparison, the antimony levels detected in other common terrestrial fungi from the same area, both <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> and ectomycorrhizal, were more than an <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order of magnitude</a> smaller.

Nikki and Paulo

Nikki Fernandez and Paulo are <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a>s on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> drama television series "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>", which chronicles the lives of over forty people after their plane crashes on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. American actress <a href="Kiele%20Sanchez">Kiele Sanchez</a> and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian actor <a href="Rodrigo%20Santoro">Rodrigo Santoro</a> play the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815.

The couple is introduced early in the <a href="Lost%20%28season%203%29">third season</a>. The producers of the show were often asked what the rest of the plane-crash survivors were doing because the show only focuses on approximately fifteen of the survivors, and the characters of Nikki and Paulo were created in response. Reaction to the characters was generally negative, with <a href="show%20runner">show runner</a>, <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a>, acknowledging the couple are "universally despised" by fans. As a result of this, the couple was killed off later in the same season when they are accidentally buried alive.

Originally from <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Paulo is a <a href="confidence%20trick">con artist</a> working with his American girlfriend Nikki, an actress. Paulo works as a chef for a wealthy television executive in Sydney. Nikki guest stars on the executive's show and also seduces him, which makes Paulo uncomfortable. Paulo murders the executive by poisoning his food, allowing him and Nikki to steal his bag of diamonds, which are worth $8 million. Three days later, on September 22, 2004, Nikki and Paulo board Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Nikki's home in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.

They lose the diamonds in the plane crash and spend much of their time on the island searching for them. Paulo suspects they are the only reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while looking in the jungle, they come across the , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the <a href="Others%20%28Lost%29">Others</a> speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.

On their seventy-second day on the island, Nikki and Paulo join <a href="John%20Locke%20%28Lost%29">Locke</a> when he ventures back to the Pearl Station, hoping to communicate with the Others. Paulo returns to the toilet to retrieve the diamonds, storing them in his underwear thereafter. As they leave, the group witnesses <a href="Mr.%20Eko">Mr. Eko</a>'s death and burial not far from The Pearl. Eighty-one days after the crash, Nikki finds out about Paulo hiding the diamonds from her. Furious, she releases a venomous spider on him that causes Paulo to be paralyzed for the next eight hours. As he is entering the state of paralysis, Paulo admits he only kept the diamonds from her because he thought she would leave him after she got them. To Nikki's dismay, the death of the venomous spider only attracted more spiders which bite Nikki, so she is also temporarily paralyzed. The pair are mistaken for dead after being discovered by the survivors. Nikki and Paulo are then buried alive by <a href="James%20%26quot%3BSawyer%26quot%3B%20Ford">James "Sawyer" Ford</a> and <a href="Hugo%20%26quot%3BHurley%26quot%3B%20Reyes">Hugo "Hurley" Reyes</a> after tossing the diamonds in the grave with them as they consider them to be of no value on the island. Much later, <a href="Miles%20Straume">Miles Straume</a> − a psychic who can read people's thoughts from their time of death − indicates he knows about the diamonds.

Paulo was written to be unlikable, with the hope he would redeem himself when his backstory was revealed in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions of some of the survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.

Nikki is manipulative of Paulo and appears to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using him to get the diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.

At the end of the first season, the writers had the idea one of the <a href="extra%20%28actor%29">background survivors</a> would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, "What the hell is going on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" The first of those was <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Dr.%20Leslie%20Arzt">Leslie Arzt</a>, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them "Nina" and "Pablo" and asking "who the hell [they were]". Lindelof later stated, "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.

Nikki and Paulo's original introduction onto the show was deleted for time from the final cut of the episode, "<a href="Further%20Instructions">Further Instructions</a>". They were supposed to be accidentally found by <a href="Claire%20Littleton">Claire Littleton</a> in Jack's tent having sex in the middle of the episode. They were instead introduced at the end of the episode when Locke makes a speech.

Half-French, half-<a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a> <a href="Kiele%20Sanchez">Kiele Michelle Sanchez</a> portrayed Nikki in six episodes of the third season of "Lost". She had trouble filming her burial scene due to her <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a>. <a href="Rodrigo%20Santoro">Rodrigo Santoro</a>, who has been called "the Brazilian <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>" and "the Brazilian <a href="Russell%20Crowe">Russell Crowe</a>", was cast in his first major American television role as Paulo on "Lost". Appearing in a total of seven episodes, Santoro was reportedly paid "between $2634 and $6427 a week". Lindelof called Santoro "talented" and "perfect for "Lost" because he's a face that the American audience is not familiar with", despite being an award-winning actor in his home country of Brazil. Part of the reason Santoro was cast over other actors was because his physique was deemed attractive; however, the writers said that they were not interested in writing for his character with that in mind, nor did he want them to. Santoro has stated he enjoyed working with Sanchez and hoped to return to work on "Lost".

Reaction to the "devious, but doomed" characters was more negative than for other "Lost" characters. One "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" journalist gave Paulo the nickname "Paulo Poops-a-Lot", referencing scenes from the episodes "<a href="The%20Cost%20of%20Living%20%28Lost%29">The Cost of Living</a>" and "<a href="Enter%2077">Enter 77</a>". <a href="AOL">America Online</a><nowiki>'</nowiki>s TV Squad criticized the writing for the characters, and the characters were called "incredibly annoying" by "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" magazine. "<a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a>" called Paulo "walking collateral damage". "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" wrote they were "too darn perfect-looking to be believable as humans". "Entertainment Weekly" included them in their list of the "21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever", commenting "no one could have predicted how grating the pair's whiny inanity would become."

When rumors circulated on the Internet and were mentioned in ABC commercials that the characters were going to die, some viewers hoped for a "double murder" of Nikki and Paulo and rejoiced when their wish was granted. Over three months before the episode aired on television, Santoro stated in an interview with Brazilian "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that his character would die in the middle of the third season. It was also announced that Sanchez had signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for another ABC show, "<a href="Football%20Wives">Football Wives</a>", and thus, it would have been unlikely for her to continue to act as a "murderous femme fatale".

William Bruce (architect)

Sir William Bruce of Kinross, 1st Baronet (c. 1630 – 1 January 1710), was a Scottish <a href="gentleman">gentleman</a>-<a href="architect">architect</a>, "the effective founder of <a href="classical%20architecture">classical architecture</a> in Scotland," as <a href="Howard%20Colvin">Howard Colvin</a> observes. As a key figure in introducing the <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> style into Scotland, he has been compared to the pioneering English architects <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, and to the contemporaneous introducers of French style in English domestic architecture, <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a> and Sir <a href="Roger%20Pratt%20%28architect%29">Roger Pratt</a>.

Bruce was a merchant in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> during the 1650s, and played a role in the <a href="The%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> in 1659. He carried messages between the exiled king and <a href="George%20Monck%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Albemarle">General Monck</a>, and his loyalty to the king was rewarded with lucrative official appointments, including that of <a href="Master%20of%20Work%20to%20the%20Crown%20of%20Scotland">Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland</a>, effectively making Bruce the "king's architect". His patrons included <a href="John%20Maitland%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lauderdale">John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale</a>, the most powerful man in Scotland at that time, and Bruce rose to become a member of Parliament, and briefly sat on the Scottish <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Scotland">Privy Council</a>.

Despite his lack of technical expertise, Bruce became the most prominent architect of his time in Scotland. He worked with competent masons and professional builders, to whom he imparted a classical vocabulary; thus his influence was carried far beyond his own aristocratic circle. Beginning in the 1660s, Bruce built and remodelled a number of country houses, including <a href="Thirlestane%20Castle">Thirlestane Castle</a> for the Duke of Lauderdale, and <a href="Prestonfield%20House">Prestonfield House</a>. Among his most significant work was his own Palladian mansion at <a href="Kinross%20House">Kinross</a>, built on the Loch Leven estate which he had purchased in 1675. As the king's architect he undertook the rebuilding of the Royal Palace of <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyroodhouse</a> in the 1670s, which gave the palace its present appearance. After the death of Charles II Bruce lost political favour, and later, following the accession of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>, he was imprisoned more than once as a suspected <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a>. However, he managed to continue his architectural work, often providing his services to others with Jacobite sympathies.

Little is known of William Bruce's youth, and his date of birth is unrecorded. He was probably born at Blairhall in western <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. He may have attended <a href="St%20Andrews%20University">St Andrews University</a> in 1637–1638, which would suggest that his birth date was as early as 1625. The Bruces were a well-connected <a href="Episcopalianism%20in%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">Episcopalian</a> family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from <a href="Thomas%20Bruce%2C%201st%20Baron%20of%20Clackmannan">Thomas Bruce</a> a cousin of King <a href="Robert%20II%20of%20Scotland">Robert II</a>, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife. Bruce's first cousin Edward Bruce was created <a href="Earl%20of%20Kincardine">Earl of Kincardine</a> in 1643.

Letters in the Earl of Kincardine's papers show that William Bruce was in exile in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> during the 1650s with his cousin, <a href="Alexander%20Bruce%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Kincardine">Alexander Bruce</a>, brother of the Earl of Kincardine. As Episcopalians, William and Alexander would have sought refuge from the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a> established by <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>. In Rotterdam, they were in contact with <a href="Robert%20Moray">Sir Robert Moray</a>, a soldier and <a href="natural%20philosopher">natural philosopher</a> close to Charles II, who then resided at <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. William Bruce was a merchant, based in the Scottish community in Rotterdam, but travelling widely. He owned a ship with Alexander Bruce and John Hamilton of <a href="Grange%20House">Grange</a>, and was involved in the trade of wine, coal and timber between Norway, France, England, Scotland and the Low Countries. He is recorded as having a house and a mistress in <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a>. He may have had a son Normand by this mistress, since in 1672 he figures as a witness to the baptism at Holyrood of a William Bruce, son of Normand Bruce, mason. Moreover, the marriage record of Normand Bruce states that he was employed at Balcaskie. In 1658, William and Alexander travelled together from <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> overland to Maastricht to meet Moray. Alexander Bruce and Moray were founder members of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in 1660, and it is likely that architecture featured in their discussions, particularly the new town hall in Maastricht that Moray had recently advised on.

In 1659, Bruce acted as a messenger between <a href="George%20Monck%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Albemarle">General Monck</a>, Cromwell's commander-in-chief in Scotland, and the exiled King Charles II. A passport survives, issued to Bruce by Monck in September 1659, and giving him permission to remain in Scotland until his "returne to Holland," and it appears that the messages he brought from Charles persuaded Monck to march his army to London, a decisive event in <a href="the%20Restoration">the Restoration</a>. The nature of their communications is not known, although it would appear that Moray selected him for the task. <a href="Robert%20Douglas%20of%20Glenbervie">Sir Robert Douglas</a> stated that Bruce "painted the distress and distractions" of Scotland before the General, and suggested to him "the glory that would be acquired in restoring the royal family."

Following the restoration, William Bruce was appointed Clerk to the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament in the first case, and from petitioners to the <a href="Court%20of%20Session">Court of Session</a> in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had established himself as a courtier and scientist at <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, London, and employed Bruce as a trusted messenger between Whitehall and the <a href="John%20Maitland%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lauderdale">Duke of Lauderdale</a>, Secretary for Scotland.

Moray later served on the Treasury Commission for Scotland, as did Alexander Bruce, now Earl of Kincardine. Bruce reported to this Commission as a revenue collector, and benefited from the patronage of its members. The Commission had responsibility for the King's Works, and in 1667 Bruce was appointed Superintendent and Overseer of the Royal Palaces in Scotland. Four years later he was made <a href="Master%20of%20Work%20to%20the%20Crown%20of%20Scotland">Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland</a>, with a salary of £3600 <a href="Pound%20Scots">Scots</a> (£300 Sterling, or £  in 2019), for the purpose of rebuilding Holyroodhouse. In March 1671, Bruce was part of a <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a> which bought the rights to collect taxes over a five-year period, paying £26,000 Sterling (£  in 2019) for the privilege. As such, it would appear that Bruce was not only the architect of Holyroodhouse, but one of the principal financiers of the £21,000 project.

As a key figure of the Restoration administration, William Bruce became close to other Stuart loyalists, who included such powerful patrons as the Duke of Lauderdale, <a href="Charles%20Maitland%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lauderdale">Lord Haltoun</a>, and the <a href="John%20Leslie%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Rothes">Earl of Rothes</a>. In 1667, he undertook his first building work for Lord Rothes, overseeing the extensions to <a href="Leslie%20House">Leslie House</a>, and later worked on several of Lauderdale's properties, concurrently with Holyroodhouse. In 1668 he was created a <a href="List%20of%20extant%20Baronetcies%23Baronetage%20of%20Nova%20Scotia%20%281625%E2%80%931706%29">Baronet of Nova Scotia</a>.

From 1669 to 1674 Bruce sat in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Scottish Parliament</a> as <a href="shire%20commissioner">shire commissioner</a> for <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, and from 1681 to 1682 as a shire commissioner for <a href="Kinross-shire">Kinross</a>. From April 1685 to May 1686 he reached the peak of his political career, as a member of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Scotland">Privy Council of Scotland</a>. But, in 1674, he became embroiled in factional rivalry between his patron Lauderdale, and his rivals the <a href="William%20Douglas%2C%20Duke%20of%20Hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</a> and the <a href="John%20Hay%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Tweeddale">Earl of Tweeddale</a>. His actions, which apparently included passing information to Hamilton, invoked the fury of the <a href="Elizabeth%20Maitland%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Lauderdale">Duchess of Lauderdale</a>, who tried to persuade her husband to deprive Bruce of his offices. Bruce survived, although his relationship with his patron was damaged. Lauderdale described him as "the bitterest factionalist partie man of his quality in all Scotland". This breakdown resulted in Bruce's eventual dismissal as Surveyor General of the King's Works, on the false pretext that Holyroodhouse was finished.

Bruce's earnings from his offices had made him a wealthy man, even by the standards of his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the <a href="Balcaskie">Balcaskie</a> estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of <a href="Loch%20Leven%20%28Kinross%29">Loch Leven</a>, Kinross, from the <a href="Earl%20of%20Morton">Earl of Morton</a>, which brought him the hereditary <a href="sheriffdom">sheriffdom</a> of <a href="Kinross-shire">Kinross-shire</a>. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.
Following the accession of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James VII</a> in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Revolution of 1688</a>, and the accession of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a> as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential <a href="jacobitism">Jacobite</a> threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in <a href="Stirling%20Castle">Stirling Castle</a> for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a>. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son <a href="Sir%20John%20Bruce%2C%202nd%20Baronet">John Bruce</a>. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.

He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents.

Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Garden%20Edinburgh">Edinburgh Botanic Garden</a>, and may have known <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> and other English horticulturalists.

Around 1660 William Bruce married Mary Halkett, daughter of Sir James Halkett of Pitfirrane, Bt. They had two surviving children:


After the death of his first wife, Sir William Bruce married Magdalen Scott, widow of an Edinburgh merchant called George Clerk, in 1700. They had no issue. Magdalen lived until 1752, and gained a reputation as a Jacobite, establishing a Jacobite cell at her home in Leith Citadel.

The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20%28Amsterdam%29">Amsterdam City Hall</a> (1648–65), the work of <a href="Jacob%20van%20Campen">Jacob van Campen</a>, and <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>'s City Hall (1659–64), by <a href="Pieter%20Post">Pieter Post</a>. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the <a href="House%20of%20Orange">House of Orange</a>, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.

Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further "foreign journey" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including <a href="Vaux-le-Vicomte">Vaux-le-Vicomte</a>, <a href="Bl%C3%A9rancourt">Blérancourt</a>, and the Chateau de <a href="Balleroy">Balleroy</a>, the last the work of French architect <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mansart">François Mansart</a>. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two <a href="enfilade%20%28architecture%29">enfilades</a>, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.

English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a> and Sir <a href="Roger%20Pratt%20%28architect%29">Roger Pratt</a>, but with Continental detailing, such as the <a href="Rustication%20%28architecture%29">rustication</a> on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's <a href="Coleshill%20House">Coleshill House</a> of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an "international style", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

Bruce's early work involved advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. <a href="Panmure%20House">Panmure House</a> and <a href="Leslie%20House">Leslie House</a> (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason <a href="John%20Mylne%20%281611-1667%29">John Mylne</a>. At Panmure, although Bruce has been credited with the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and only a small part of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the <a href="William%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Queensberry">Duke of Queensberry</a> regarding his plans for <a href="Drumlanrig%20Castle">Drumlanrig Castle</a>.

Bruce also worked on his own property at <a href="Balcaskie">Balcaskie</a>, Fife, which he bought in 1665, and which does survive intact, although with later alterations. He doubled the L-plan house to a near-symmetrical U-plan, and may have built the curving wing-walls and linking pavilions. Gifford, however, attributes these to a later building phase. The curving walls, a form later seen at Hopetoun, were a new innovation if Bruce did carry them out, possibly inspired by the work of the Italian <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Gian Lorenzo Bernini</a>. In the gardens he laid out <a href="parterre">parterre</a>s and stepped "Italian" terraces, with a vista leading the eye to the <a href="Bass%20Rock">Bass Rock</a>, all inspired by <a href="French%20Baroque%20architecture">French baroque</a> gardens such as Vaux-le-Vicomte. Internally, Bruce created a new layout of rooms, and it was for his continental-inspired internal planning, as much as his exterior design, that he was sought after as an architect.

In 1670 the Duke of Lauderdale commissioned Bruce to remodel <a href="Thirlestane%20Castle">Thirlestane Castle</a>, his 16th-century <a href="tower%20house">tower house</a> in the Border country. Bruce, working with King's master mason <a href="Robert%20Mylne%20%281633-1710%29">Robert Mylne</a>, extended the building with new corner pavilions and a new entrance, and re-planned the interior. Lauderdale continued to employ Bruce, often working closely with Lord Haltoun, Lauderdale's brother, during the 1670s, on his homes at <a href="Brunstane%20House">Brunstane</a> near Edinburgh, and Lethington (later renamed <a href="Lennoxlove">Lennoxlove</a>), as well as commissioning a design for new gates at his English property, <a href="Ham%20House">Ham House</a>, near London, in 1671. At Ham Bruce may have had further involvement with the remodelling works going on there, under the direction of the English architect <a href="William%20Samwell%20%28architect%29">William Samwell</a>. While engaged at Thirlestane, Bruce also designed the nearby <a href="Lauder">Lauder</a> Kirk, his only complete church. One of very few 17th century cruciform-plan churches in Scotland, it may have been inspired by François Mansart's similar church at Balleroy in France.

William Bruce's appointment as Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland was made chiefly for the purpose of rebuilding the palace of <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyroodhouse</a>. Aside from this project, he only carried out minor repairs to Edinburgh and Stirling Castles, and to the fortifications on the Bass Rock. Charles I had intended to extend and rebuild Holyroodhouse, and plans had been drawn up in the 1630s. Nothing was done however, and in 1650 the palace was burnt out, destroying all but the west range. Bruce was contracted to design and oversee the works, with Robert Mylne acting as contractor. Bruce's plans were drawn up by Mylne, as Bruce himself apparently lacked the technical skills of architectural drawing.

Charles II criticised Bruce's initial plans for the internal layout, and an improved scheme was eventually approved. Construction began in July 1671, and by 1674 much of the work was complete. Bruce built a second gothic tower to mirror the existing one built by <a href="James%20V%20of%20Scotland">James V</a> between 1528 and 1532, and created the courtyard block in a restrained classical style. A second phase of work started in 1676, when the Duke of Lauderdale ordered Bruce to demolish and rebuild the main west façade, resulting by 1679 in the screen wall, topped by a carved imperial crown, which forms the main entrance.

Also in 1676, Bruce drew up plans for the completion of <a href="George%20Heriot%27s%20School">Heriot's Hospital</a> in Edinburgh, which had been started in the 1620s. His design, for the central tower of the south façade, was eventually executed in 1693.

His first commission for a new building was for the construction of Dunkeld House, and came from the <a href="John%20Murray%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Atholl">Earl of Atholl</a> in 1676. The house had been badly damaged in 1654, during the <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">civil war</a>, and Bruce was given the task of building its replacement. (The house was later demolished). Another early full-scale commission was for Moncrieffe House (1679), which burned down in 1957. 
In 1675, Bruce bought the estate of <a href="Loch%20Leven%20%28Kinross%29">Loch Leven</a> from the <a href="Earl%20of%20Morton">Earl of Morton</a>. The estate included an old manor near <a href="Kinross">Kinross</a>, as well as the ruins of <a href="Loch%20Leven%20Castle">Loch Leven Castle</a>, famous as the jail of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. After carrying out repairs on the old manor, and beginning to lay out the gardens, Bruce began work on his new home, <a href="Kinross%20House">Kinross House</a>, in 1686, employing master mason Thomas Bauchop. The <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> building bears some resemblance to Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 (demolished), but with features Bruce derived from French sources. These features, ultimately classical and Italian in origin, include the rusticated basement stonework, and the <a href="giant%20order">giant order</a> of <a href="Corinthian%20order">corinthian</a> pilasters, the latter possibly deriving from Bernini's first designs for the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>. Following Bruce's fall from favour, he found himself increasingly in debt, which delayed the completion of the house until 1693. Kinross was one of the earliest Palladian-style country houses in Scotland, and was recognised as one of the finest buildings in the country; <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> described it as "the most beautiful and regular piece of Architecture in Scotland", and <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a> called Kinross "the first good house of regular architecture in North Britain".

Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and <a href="Craigiehall">Craigiehall</a> (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Annandale">Marquess of Annandale</a>, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young <a href="Charles%20Hope%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hopetoun">Charles Hope</a>, later first <a href="Earl%20of%20Hopetoun">Earl of Hopetoun</a>. <a href="Hopetoun%20House">Hopetoun House</a>, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French <a href="Rustication%20%28architecture%29">rustication</a>. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th century remodelling, carried out by <a href="William%20Adam%20%28architect%29">William Adam</a>. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at <a href="Abercorn">Abercorn</a> Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval "squint" giving a view of the pulpit.

In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> to design a new <a href="Toll%20house">tolbooth</a> for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Borders</a>, and his smallest house, <a href="Auchendinny">Auchendinny</a> in <a href="Midlothian">Midlothian</a>. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite <a href="William%20Murray%2C%202nd%20Lord%20Nairne">Lord Nairne</a>. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>.

Although <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> called Bruce "the Kit Wren of North Britain", for his role as the effective founder of classical architecture in that country, Gifford suggests he is more comparable to <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a> and <a href="Roger%20Pratt%20%28architect%29">Roger Pratt</a> in his achievements. Like May and Pratt, he popularised a style of country house amongst the nobility, encouraging the move away from the traditional "tower house", which came to be perceived as increasingly anachronistic, towards a more continental, leisure-oriented architecture. Sir <a href="John%20Clerk%20of%20Penicuik">John Clerk of Penicuik</a> named Bruce as "the chief introducer of architecture in this country", while to <a href="Colen%20Campbell">Colen Campbell</a>, compiler of "Vitruvius Britannicus", he was "justly esteem'd the best Architect of his time in that Kingdom". His work was a major influence on the design of country houses in the 18th century, an influence which was spread through the masons and draughtsmen he worked with, including Mylne and Bauchop, <a href="james%20Smith%20%28architect%29">James Smith</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Edward">Alexander Edward</a>. At Kinross his deliberate alignment of the main vista on the ruins of Lochleven Castle suggested to <a href="Howard%20Colvin">Howard Colvin</a> "that Bruce, like <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">Vanbrugh</a>, has a place in the prehistory of the <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a>".

Campbell's Soup Cans

Campbell's Soup Cans, which is sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans, is a <a href="work%20of%20art">work of art</a> produced between November 1961 and March or April 1962 by <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring in height × in width and each consisting of a painting of a <a href="Campbell%20Soup%20Company">Campbell's Soup</a> can—one of each of the <a href="canned%20soup">canned soup</a> varieties the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced by a <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> method—the semi-mechanized <a href="screen%20printing">screen printing</a> process, using a non-<a href="painterly">painterly</a> style. "Campbell's Soup Cans"' reliance on themes from <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> helped to usher in <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> as a major <a href="art%20movement">art movement</a> in the United States.

Warhol, a commercial <a href="illustrator">illustrator</a> who became a successful author, publisher, painter, and film director, showed the work on July 9, 1962, in his first one-man <a href="art%20gallery">gallery</a> exhibition as a <a href="fine%20artist">fine artist</a> in the <a href="Ferus%20Gallery">Ferus Gallery</a> of Los Angeles, California curated by Irving Blum. The exhibition marked the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> debut of pop art. The combination of the semi-mechanized process, the non-painterly style, and the commercial subject initially caused offense, as the work's blatantly mundane commercialism represented a direct affront to the technique and philosophy of <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionism</a>. In the United States the abstract expressionism art movement was dominant during the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">war</a> period, and it held not only to "fine art" values and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a> but also to a <a href="Mysticism">mystical</a> inclination. This controversy led to a great deal of debate about the merits and ethics of such work. Warhol's motives as an artist were questioned, and they continue to be topical to this day. The large public commotion helped transform Warhol from being an accomplished 1950s commercial illustrator to a notable fine artist, and it helped distinguish him from other rising pop artists. Although commercial demand for his paintings was not immediate, Warhol's association with the subject led to his name becoming synonymous with the "Campbell's Soup Can" paintings.

Warhol subsequently produced a wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans <a href="Theme%20%28visual%20arts%29">theme</a> is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the point where he was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.

Warhol arrived in New York City in 1949, directly from the <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20College%20of%20Fine%20Arts">School of Fine Arts</a> at <a href="Carnegie%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a>. He quickly achieved success as a commercial illustrator, and his first published drawing appeared in the Summer 1949 issue of "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour Magazine</a>". In 1952, he had his first art gallery show at the <a href="Bodley%20Gallery">Bodley Gallery</a> with a display of <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>-inspired works. By 1955, he was tracing photographs borrowed from the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a>'s photo collection with the hired assistance of Nathan Gluck, and reproducing them with a process he had developed earlier as a collegian at Carnegie Tech. His process, which foreshadowed his later work, involved pressing wet ink illustrations against adjoining paper. During the 1950s, he had regular showings of his drawings, and exhibited at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> ("Recent Drawings", 1956).

In 1960, Warhol began producing his first canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, he learned the process of <a href="silkscreen">silkscreen</a>ing from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a <a href="stencil">stencil</a> drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were <a href="United%20States%20one-dollar%20bill">U.S. dollar bills</a>. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.

Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of <a href="comic%20strips">comic strips</a> and of other <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to soup cans as a subject at the time to avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and <a href="James%20Rosenquist">James Rosenquist</a>, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." Between November 1961 and March or April 1962 he produced the set of soup cans. In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> pictures at <a href="Leo%20Castelli">Leo Castelli</a>'s eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings. Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's, although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as <a href="Popeye">Popeye</a>, while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance). Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time. [He would, in November 1964, be exhibiting Warhol, his "Flower Paintings", and then again Warhol in 1966.] Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by <a href="Wayne%20Thiebaud">Wayne Thiebaud</a>'s April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works. Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works. In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and <a href="Robert%20Indiana">Robert Indiana</a>, but all three were insulted by this proposition.

Irving Blum was the first dealer to show Warhol's soup can paintings. Blum happened to be visiting Warhol in December 1961 and then May 1962, at a time when Warhol was being featured in a May 11, 1962 "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine <a href="Article%20%28publishing%29">article</a> "The Slice-of-Cake School" (that included a portion of Warhol's silkscreened "200 One Dollar Bills"), along with Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, and <a href="Wayne%20Thiebaud">Wayne Thiebaud</a>. Warhol was the only artist whose photograph actually appeared in the article, which is indicative of his knack for manipulating the mass media. Blum saw dozens of Campbell's Soup can variations, including a grid of "One-Hundred Soup Cans" that day. Blum was shocked that Warhol had no <a href="Art%20gallery">gallery</a> arrangement and offered him a July show at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This would be Warhol's first one-man show of his pop art. Warhol was assured by Blum that the newly founded "<a href="Artforum">Artforum</a> magazine", which had an office above the gallery, would cover the show. Not only was the show Warhol's first solo gallery exhibit, but it was considered to be the West Coast premiere of pop art. A letter from Blum to Warhol dated June 9, 1962 set the exhibition opening for July 9th. Andy Warhol's first New York solo Pop exhibit was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works "<a href="Marilyn%20Diptych">Marilyn Diptych</a>", "<a href="Green%20Coca-Cola%20Bottles">Green Coca-Cola Bottles</a>", and "Campbell's Soup Cans".

Warhol sent Blum thirty-two canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each representing a particular variety of the Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. A postcard dated June 26, 1962 sent by from Irving Blum states " 32 ptgs arrived safely and look beautiful. strongly advise maintaining a low price level during initial exposure here". The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: "Clam Chowder" has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said "(<a href="Clam%20Chowder%23Manhattan%20clam%20chowder">Manhattan Style</a>)", which means that the soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; "Beef" has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says "(With Vegetables and Barley)"; "Scotch Broth" has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said "(A Hearty Soup)"; and "Minestrone" had black parenthetical lettering saying "(Italian-Style Vegetable Soup)". There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: "Beef Broth (Bouillon)" and "Consommé (Beef)." The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. "Old-fashioned Tomato Rice" is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. "Old-fashioned Tomato Rice" has the word "Soup" depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, "Cheddar Cheese" has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says "New!", and a middle center golden banner says "Great As A Sauce Too!".

The <a href="Art%20exhibition">exhibition</a> opened on July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases were placed in a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today to have been a watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A <a href="John%20Coplans">John Coplans</a> "Artforum" article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's <a href="studio">studio</a>, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured <a href="Object%20%28philosophy%29">objects</a>. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. <a href="Dennis%20Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a> was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 <a href="Installment%20plan">installments</a> to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.

The Ferus show closed on August 4, 1962, the day before <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>'s death. Warhol went on to purchase a Monroe publicity still from the film <a href="Niagara%20%28film%29">Niagara</a>, which he later cropped and used to create one of his most well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> bottles, <a href="S%26amp%3BH%20Green%20Stamps">S&H Green Stamps</a>, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Liz</a> in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and <a href="Brooke%20Hayward">Brooke Hayward</a> (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.

Since Warhol gave no indication of a definitive ordering of the collection, the sequence chosen by <a href="MoMA">MoMA</a> (in the picture at the upper right of this article) in the display from their permanent <a href="Collection%20%28museum%29">collection</a> reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with "Tomato" in the upper left, which debuted in 1897. By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving "Clam Chowder" to the upper left and "Tomato" to the bottom of the four rows.

Several <a href="Anecdote">anecdotal</a> stories supposedly explain why Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as the focal point of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was <a href="Muriel%20Latow">Muriel Latow</a> who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.

Muriel Latow was then an aspiring <a href="interior%20decorator">interior decorator</a>, and owner of the Latow Art Gallery in the <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">East 60s</a> in Manhattan. She told Warhol that he should paint "Something you see every day and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." Ted Carey, who was there at the time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: "Oh that sounds fabulous." A $50 check dated November 23, 1961 in the archive of the Andy Warhol Museum confirms the story. According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years."

Another account of Latow's influence on Warhol holds that she asked him what he loved most, and because he replied "money" she suggested that he paint U.S. dollar bills. According to this story, Latow later advised that in addition to painting money he should paint something else very simple, such as Campbell's Soup cans.

In an interview for London's "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>" in 1985, David Yarritu asked Warhol about flowers that Warhol's mother made from <a href="tin%20can">tin can</a>s. In his response, Warhol mentioned them as one of the reasons behind his first tin can paintings:

Several stories mention that Warhol's choice of soup cans reflected his own avid devotion to Campbell's soup as a consumer. <a href="Robert%20Indiana">Robert Indiana</a> once said: "I knew Andy very well. The reason he painted soup cans is that he liked soup." He was thought to have focused on them because they composed a daily dietary staple. Others observed that Warhol merely painted things he held close at <a href="Heart%20%28symbol%29">heart</a>. He enjoyed eating Campbell's soup, had a taste for Coca-Cola, loved money, and admired movie stars. Thus, they all became subjects of his work. Yet another account says that his daily lunches in his studio consisted of Campbell's Soup and Coca-Cola, and thus, his inspiration came from seeing the empty cans and bottles accumulate on his desk.

Warhol did not choose the cans because of business relationships with the Campbell Soup Company. Even though the company at the time sold four out of every five cans of prepared soup in the United States, Warhol preferred that the company not be involved "because the whole point would be lost with any kind of commercial <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a>." However, by 1965, the company knew him well enough that he was able to coax actual can labels from them to use as invitations for an exhibit. They even commissioned a canvas.

Warhol had a positive view of ordinary culture and felt the <a href="abstract%20expressionist">abstract expressionist</a>s had taken great pains to ignore the splendor of <a href="modernity">modernity</a>. The "Campbell's Soup Can" series, along with his other series, provided him with a chance to express his positive view of modern culture. However, his <a href="deadpan">deadpan</a> manner endeavored to be devoid of emotional and social commentary. The work was intended to be without personality or individual expression. Warhol's view is encapsulated in the "Time" magazine description of the 'Slice of Cake School,' that "... a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can, when transposed to canvas, become Art."

His pop art work differed from serial works by artists such as <a href="Monet">Monet</a>, who used series to represent discriminating <a href="perception">perception</a> and show that a painter could recreate shifts in time, light, season, and weather with hand and eye. Warhol is now understood to represent the modern era of commercialization and indiscriminate "sameness." When Warhol eventually showed variation it was not "realistic." His later variations in color were almost a mockery of discriminating perception. His adoption of the pseudo-industrial silkscreen process spoke against the use of a series to demonstrate subtlety. Warhol sought to reject invention and nuance by creating the appearance that his work had been printed, and he systematically recreated imperfections. His series work helped him escape Lichtenstein's lengthening shadow. Although his soup cans were not as shocking and vulgar as some of his other early pop art, they still offended the art world's sensibilities that had developed so as to partake in the intimate emotions of artistic expression.

Contrasting against <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>'s sensual baskets of fruit, <a href="Jean-Baptiste-Sim%C3%A9on%20Chardin">Chardin</a>'s plush peaches, or <a href="C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>'s vibrant arrangements of apples, the mundane "Campbell's Soup Cans" gave the art world a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics for those who had not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art can be seen as a relation to <a href="Minimal%20art">Minimal art</a> in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.

Warhol clearly changed the concept of art appreciation. Instead of harmonious three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration with an emphasis on the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.

In Europe, audiences had a very different take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, it was at least considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.

In an effort to complement the message of his art, Warhol developed a pop persona after the mass media took note of his pop art. He began to manifest a teenage-like image, immersing himself in pop culture such as <a href="Rock%20%26amp%3B%20Roll">Rock & Roll</a> shows and fan magazines. Whereas previous artists used repetition to demonstrate their skill at depicting variation, Warhol coupled "repetition" with "monotony" as he professed his love of artwork themes.

Warhol followed the success of his original series with several related works incorporating the same theme of Campbell's Soup cans subjects. These subsequent works along with the original are collectively referred to as the Campbell's Soup cans series and often simply as the Campbell's Soup cans. The subsequent Campbell's Soup can works were very diverse. The heights ranged from to . Generally, the cans were portrayed as if they were freshly produced cans without flaws. Occasionally, he chose to depict cans with torn <a href="label">label</a>s, peeling labels, crushed bodies, or opened <a href="Lid%20%28container%29">lids</a> (images right). Sometimes he added related items like a bowl of soup or a can opener (in the image on the right below). Sometimes he produced images of related items without any soup cans such as the box sculpture "Campbell's Tomato Juice Box" (above left), which are not strictly a part of the series although a part of the theme. Many of these <a href="Work%20of%20art">works</a> were now being produced at the already acclaimed studio, "<a href="The%20Factory">The Factory</a>."

Irving Blum made the original thirty-two canvases available to the public through an arrangement with the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original "Campbell's Soup Cans" is now a part of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> permanent collection. A print called "<a href="Campbell%27s%20Soup%20Cans%20II">Campbell's Soup Cans II</a>" is part of the permanent collection of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Chicago">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Chicago. "200 Campbell's Soup Cans", 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72 inches x 100 inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single canvas of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it as one of the most significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as <a href="Jasper%20Johns">Jasper Johns</a> and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art. The very similar "100 Cans" from the <a href="Albright-Knox%20Art%20Gallery">Albright-Knox Art Gallery</a> collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be "Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice)," a 1961 ink, tempera, crayon, and oil canvas.

In many of the works, including the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors of life in the sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.

By 1970, Warhol established the record auction price for a painting by a living American artist with a $60,000 sale of "Big Campbell's Soup Can with Torn Label (Vegetable Beef)" (1962) in a sale at <a href="Parke-Bernet">Parke-Bernet</a>, the preeminent American auction house of the day (later acquired by <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>). This record was broken a few months later by his rival for the artworld's attention and approval, Lichtenstein, who sold a depiction of a giant brush stroke, "<a href="Big%20Painting%20No.%206">Big Painting No. 6</a>" (1965) for $75,000.

In May 2006, Warhol's "Small Torn Campbell Soup Can (Pepper Pot)" (1962) sold for $11,776,000 and set the current <a href="auction">auction</a> <a href="world%20record">world record</a> for a painting from the "Campbell Soup Can" series. The painting was purchased for the collection of <a href="Eli%20Broad">Eli Broad</a>, a man who once set the record for the largest <a href="credit%20card">credit card</a> transaction when he purchased Lichtenstein's "I ... I'm Sorry" for $2.5 million with an <a href="American%20Express">American Express</a> card. The $11.8 million Warhol sale was part of the <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> Sales of <a href="Impressionist">Impressionist</a>, <a href="Modern%20art">Modern</a>, Post-War and <a href="Contemporary%20art">Contemporary</a> Art for the Spring Season of 2006 that totaled $438,768,924.

The broad variety of work produced using a semi-mechanized process with many collaborators, Warhol's popularity, the value of his works, and the diversity of works across various media and genre have created a need for the <a href="Andy%20Warhol%20Art%20Authentication%20Board">Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board</a> to certify the <a href="Authenticity%20in%20art">authenticity</a> of works by Warhol.

On April 7, 2016, seven "Campbell's Soup Cans" prints were stolen from the <a href="http%3A//www.springfieldmo.gov/art/">Springfield Art Museum</a>. The <a href="FBI">FBI</a> announced a $25,000 reward for information about the stolen art pieces.

Warhol's production of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first took place in 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with a wider variety of hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while <a href="Mirror%20image">inverting</a> and reversing the images. Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after <a href="Andy%20Warhol%23Attempted%20assassination">his 1968 shooting</a>—which occurred the day before the <a href="Bobby%20Kennedy">Bobby Kennedy</a> assassination—to be less significant than that done before it.

The best-remembered Warhol Campbell's Soup can works are from the first phase. Warhol is further regarded for his iconic serial celebrity silkscreens of such people as <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> and <a href="Liz%20Taylor">Liz Taylor</a>, produced during his 1962–1964 silkscreening phase. His most commonly repeated painting subjects are Taylor, Monroe, Presley, <a href="Jackie%20Kennedy">Jackie Kennedy</a> and similar celebrities. In addition to being a notable fine artist, Warhol was a renowned cinematographer, author, and commercial illustrator. Posthumously, he became the subject of the largest single-artist art museum in the United States in 1994. Many Warhol art exhibits include footage of his cinematic directorial efforts (e.g., The Museum of Contemporary Art's ANDY WARHOL/SUPERNOVA: Stars, Deaths, Disasters, 1962–1964 that ran from March 18, 2006 – June 18, 2006). Some say his contributions as an artist pale in comparison to his contributions as a film-maker. Others make it clear that he was not the most conventionally skilled artist of his day. Nonetheless, his techniques were emulated by other highly respected artists and his works continue to command high prices.

Elk

The elk or wapiti ("Cervus canadensis") is one of the largest species within the <a href="deer">deer</a> family, <a href="Cervidae">Cervidae</a>, in the world, and one of the largest terrestrial <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="Northeast%20Asia">Northeast Asia</a>. This animal should not be confused with the still larger <a href="moose">moose</a> ("Alces alces") to which the name "elk" applies in <a href="British%20English">British English</a> and in reference to populations in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.

Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large <a href="antler">antler</a>s which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the <a href="rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and "bugling", a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.

Although they are native to North America and eastern Asia, they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced, including <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Their great adaptability may threaten <a href="endemic">endemic</a> species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced.

Elk are susceptible to a number of <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, some of which can be transmitted to livestock. Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations, largely by vaccination, have had mixed success.

Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their <a href="velvet%20%28antler%20covering%29">velvet</a> are used in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>s. Elk are hunted as a game species. The meat is leaner and higher in <a href="protein">protein</a> than <a href="beef">beef</a> or <a href="chicken">chicken</a>.

Elk were long believed to belong to a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the European <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> ("Cervus elaphus"), but evidence from many <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> genetic studies beginning in 1998 shows that the two are distinct <a href="species">species</a>. Key morphological differences that distinguish "C. canadensis" from "C. elaphus" are the former's wider rump patch and paler-hued antlers.

Early European explorers in North America, who were familiar with the smaller <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal resembled a <a href="moose">moose</a>, and consequently gave it the name "elk", which is the common European name for moose. The word "elk" is related to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "alces", <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "elgr", <a href="Scandinavian%20languages">Scandinavian</a> "elg"/"älg" and <a href="German%20Language">German</a> "Elch", all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the <a href="moose">moose</a>.

The name "wapiti" is from the <a href="Shawnee%20language">Shawnee</a> and <a href="Cree%20language">Cree</a> word "waapiti", meaning "white rump". This name is used in particular for the Asian subspecies (<a href="Altai%20wapiti">Altai wapiti</a>, <a href="Tian%20Shan%20wapiti">Tian Shan wapiti</a>, <a href="Manchurian%20wapiti">Manchurian wapiti</a> and <a href="Alashan%20wapiti">Alashan wapiti</a>), because in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> the name "elk" continues to be used for the moose.

"Wapiti" is also the preferred name for the species in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

Asian subspecies are sometimes referred to as the "maral", but this name applies primarily to the <a href="Caspian%20red%20deer">Caspian red deer</a> ("Cervus elaphus maral"), a subspecies of red deer. There is a subspecies of elk in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> called the <a href="Altai%20wapiti">Altai wapiti</a> ("Cervus canadensis sibiricus"), also known as the Altai maral.

Members of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Cervus">Cervus</a>" (and hence early relatives or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record 25 million years ago, during the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, but do not appear in the North American fossil record until the early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. The extinct <a href="Irish%20elk">Irish elk</a> ("Megaloceros") was not a member of the genus "Cervus", but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.

Until recently, red deer and elk were considered to be one species, "Cervus elaphus". However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the "Cervus" deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely "Cervus canadensis". The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the "C. elaphus" species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to <a href="Thorold%27s%20deer">Thorold's deer</a> and even <a href="sika%20deer">sika deer</a> than they are to the red deer. Elk and red deer produce fertile offspring in captivity, and the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's <a href="Fiordland%20National%20Park">Fiordland National Park</a>, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.

There are numerous <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of elk described, with six from North America and four from Asia, although some <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomists</a> consider them different <a href="ecotype">ecotype</a>s or <a href="Race%20%28biology%29">races</a> of the same species (adapted to local environments through minor changes in appearance and behavior). Populations vary as to antler shape and size, body size, coloration and mating behavior. <a href="DNA">DNA</a> investigations of the Eurasian subspecies revealed that <a href="Phenotype">phenotypic</a> variation in antlers, mane and rump patch development are based on "climatic-related lifestyle factors".
Of the six subspecies of elk known to have inhabited North America in historical times, four remain, including the <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt</a> ("C. canadensis roosevelti"), <a href="Tule%20elk">Tule</a> ("C. canadensis nannodes"), <a href="Manitoban%20elk">Manitoban</a> ("C. canadensis manitobensis") and <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20elk">Rocky Mountain</a> ("C. canadensis nelsoni"). The <a href="Eastern%20elk">Eastern elk</a> ("C. canadensis canadensis") and <a href="Merriam%27s%20elk">Merriam's elk</a> ("C. canadensis merriami") subspecies have been extinct for at least a century.

Four subspecies described in Asia include the <a href="Altai%20wapiti">Altai wapiti</a> ("C. canadensis sibiricus") and the <a href="Tianshan%20wapiti">Tianshan wapiti</a> ("C. canadensis songaricus"). Two distinct subspecies found in <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Korea">Korea</a> are the <a href="Manchurian%20wapiti">Manchurian wapiti</a> ("C. canadensis xanthopygus") and the <a href="Alashan%20wapiti">Alashan wapiti</a>s ("C. canadensis alashanicus"). The <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>n wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration than the other populations. The Alashan wapiti of north central China is the smallest of all subspecies, has the lightest coloration and is the least studied. Biologist Valerius Geist, who has written on the world's various deer species, holds that there are only three subspecies of elk. Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan wapiti but places all other elk into "C. canadensis canadensis", claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as subspecies is driven, at least partly, for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populations.

Recent DNA studies suggest that there are no more than three or four subspecies of elk. All American forms, aside from possibly the Tule and Roosevelt elk, seem to belong to one subspecies ("Cervus canadensis canadensis"). Even the Siberian elk ("Cervus canadensis sibiricus") are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the <a href="Manchurian%20wapiti">Manchurian wapiti</a> ("Cervus canadensis xanthopygus") is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms <a href="Sichuan%20deer">MacNeill's deer</a>, <a href="Kansu%20red%20deer">Kansu red deer</a>, and <a href="Tibetan%20red%20deer">Tibetan red deer</a> belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the <a href="Central%20Asian%20red%20deer">Central Asian red deer</a> ("Cervus wallichi"), which also includes the <a href="Kashmir%20stag">Kashmir stag</a>.

The elk is a large animal of the <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a> order <a href="Artiodactyla">Artiodactyla</a>, possessing an even number of toes on each foot, similar to those of <a href="camel">camel</a>s, <a href="goat">goat</a>s and <a href="cattle">cattle</a>. It is a <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a> species, with a four-chambered stomach, and feeds on grasses, plants, leaves and bark. During the summer, elk eat almost constantly, consuming between of vegetation daily. In North America, males are called "bulls", and females are called "cows". In Asia, "stag" and "hind", respectively, are sometimes used instead.

Elk are more than twice as heavy as <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> and have a more reddish hue to their hair coloring, as well as large, buff-colored rump patches and smaller tails. Moose are larger and darker than elk; bulls have distinctively different antlers. Elk gather in herds, while moose are solitary. Elk cows average , stand at the <a href="withers">wither</a>, and are from nose to tail. Bulls are some 40% larger than cows at maturity, weighing an average of , standing at the wither and averaging in length while large males reach tall at wither and in length. The largest of the subspecies is the <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt elk</a> ("C. c. roosevelti"), found west of the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s of <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a>, and in the <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> province of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Roosevelt elk have been reintroduced into <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where the largest males are estimated to weigh up to . More typically, male Roosevelt elk weigh around , while females weigh . The smallest-bodied subspecies is the <a href="tule%20elk">tule elk</a> ("C. c. nannodes"), which weighs from in both sexes.

Only the males have antlers, which start growing in the spring and are shed each winter. The largest antlers may be long and weigh . Antlers are made of bone which can grow at a rate of per day. While actively growing, the antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as <a href="velvet%20%28antler%20covering%29">velvet</a>. The velvet is shed in the summer when the antlers have fully developed. Bull elk may have eight or more tines on each antler; however, the number of tines has little to do with the age or maturity of a particular animal. The Siberian and North American elk carry the largest antlers while the Altai wapiti have the smallest. The formation and retention of antlers is <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>-driven. After the breeding season in late fall, the level of <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s released during <a href="estrus">estrus</a> declines in the environment and the testosterone levels of males drop as a consequence. This drop in testosterone leads to the shedding of antlers, usually in the early winter.

During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, which helps to insulate them during the winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat and the rest of the body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.

Adult elk usually stay in single-sex groups for most of the year. During the mating period known as the <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, mature bulls compete for the attention of the cow elk and will try to fend off rival bulls from their <a href="Polygyny%23Nature">harem</a>. Rival bulls challenge opponents by bellowing, or bugling, and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground called wallows, in which <a href="Self-anointing%23Ungulates">they urinate and roll their body</a>. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.

Dominant bulls follow groups of cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from competing bulls and predators. It is only the mature bulls that usually have large harems, and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem usually acquire it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds, and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight during the rut. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to keep their harems through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.

Bulls have a loud vocalization consisting of screams known as "bugling", which can be heard for miles. Bugling is often associated with an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day and is one of the most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a>.

Female elk have a short <a href="Estrous%20cycle">estrus</a> cycle of only a day or two, and matings usually involve a dozen or more attempts. By the autumn of their second year, females can produce one and, very rarely, two offspring, although reproduction is most common when cows weigh at least . The <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period is 240 to 262 days and the offspring weigh between . When the females are near to giving birth, they tend to isolate themselves from the main herd, and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predators. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. After two weeks, calves are able to join the herd, and are fully weaned at two months of age. Elk calves are as large as an adult <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> by the time they are six months old. The offspring will remain with their mothers for almost a year, leaving about the time that the next season's offspring are produced. The gestation period is the same for all subspecies.

Elk live 20 years or more in captivity but average 10 to 13 years in the wild. In some subspecies that suffer less predation, they may live an average of 15 years in the wild.

In North America, wolf and <a href="coyote">coyote</a> packs and the solitary <a href="cougar">cougar</a> are the most likely predators, although <a href="Brown%20bear">brown</a> and <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a> also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter- or disease-weakened adult. In the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a> which includes <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, <a href="dhole">dhole</a>, brown bear, <a href="Siberian%20tiger">Siberian tiger</a>, <a href="Amur%20leopard">Amur leopard</a>, and <a href="snow%20leopard">snow leopard</a>. <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">Eurasian lynx</a> and <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a> sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue to do so in the Amur region.

Male elk retain their antlers for more than half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is performed by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.

After the rut, females form large herds of up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close by a series of vocalizations; larger nurseries have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.

Wapiti in New Zealand have no natural predators.

As is true for many species of deer, especially those in mountainous regions, elk <a href="Animal%20migration">migrate</a> into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.

The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200,000 individuals and during the spring and fall, they take part in the longest elk migration in the continental U.S. Elk in the southern regions of Yellowstone National Park and in the surrounding <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forests</a> migrate south towards the town of <a href="Jackson%2C%20Wyoming">Jackson, Wyoming</a>, where they winter for up to six months on the <a href="National%20Elk%20Refuge">National Elk Refuge</a>. Conservationists there ensure the herd is well fed during the harsh winters. Many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, mainly to the north and west.

Elk are ruminants and therefore have four-chambered stomachs. Unlike white-tailed deer and moose, which are primarily browsers, elk are similar to <a href="cattle">cattle</a> in that they are primarily <a href="Grazing">grazers</a>. But like other deer, they also <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browse</a>. Elk have a tendency to do most of their feeding in the mornings and evenings, seeking sheltered areas in between feedings to digest. Their diets vary somewhat depending on the season, with native grasses being a year-round supplement, tree bark being consumed in winter and <a href="forb">forb</a>s and tree sprouts during the summer. Elk consume an average of of various vegetation daily. Particularly fond of <a href="aspen">aspen</a> sprouts which rise in the spring, elk have had some impact on aspen groves which have been declining in some regions where elk exist.

Range and wildlife managers conduct surveys of elk pellet groups to monitor populations and resource use.

At least 53 species of <a href="protist">protist</a> and animal <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s have been identified in elk. Most of these parasites seldom lead to significant mortality among wild or captive elk. "<a href="Parelaphostrongylus%20tenuis">Parelaphostrongylus tenuis</a>" (brainworm or meningeal worm) is a parasitic <a href="nematode">nematode</a> known to affect the spinal cord and brain tissue of elk and other species, leading to death. The definitive host is the white-tailed deer, in which it normally has no ill effects. Snails and slugs, the intermediate hosts, can be inadvertently consumed by elk during grazing. The <a href="liver%20fluke">liver fluke</a> "<a href="Fascioloides%20magna">Fascioloides magna</a>" and the nematode "<a href="Dictyocaulus">Dictyocaulus viviparus</a>" are also commonly found parasites that can be fatal to elk. Since infection by either of these parasites can be lethal to some commercial livestock species, their presence in elk herds is of some concern.

<a href="Chronic%20wasting%20disease">Chronic wasting disease</a>, transmitted by a <a href="misfolded%20protein">misfolded protein</a> known as a <a href="prion">prion</a>, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild in a number of regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation, and listlessness, and at an advanced stage, the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to, but not the same as <a href="Bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">mad cow disease</a>, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.

The <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative</a> <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l disease <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a> occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the only place in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions, and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as <a href="undulant%20fever">undulant fever</a>, producing <a href="influenza">influenza</a>-like symptoms that may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd-management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevertheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed .

A recent <a href="Autopsy">necropsy</a> study of captive elk in Pennsylvania attributed the cause of death in 33 of 65 cases to either gastrointestinal parasites (21 cases, primarily "<a href="Eimeria">Eimeria</a>" sp. and "<a href="Strongylida">Ostertagia</a>" sp.) or bacterial infections (12 cases, mostly <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>).

Elk hoof disease was first noticed in the state of Washington in the late 1990s in the <a href="Cowlitz%20River">Cowlitz River</a> basin, with sporadic reports of deformed hooves. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly with increased sightings throughout southwest Washington and into Oregon. The disease is characterised by deformed, broken, or missing hooves and leads to severe lameness in elk. The primary cause is not known, but it is associated with <a href="Treponema">treponeme</a> bacteria, which are known to cause <a href="digital%20dermatitis">digital dermatitis</a> in commercial livestock. The mode of transmission is also not known, but it appears to be highly contagious among elk. Studies are being undertaken by government departments to determine how to halt or eliminate the disease.

Modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a>, a <a href="steppe">steppe</a> region between Asia and North America that connected the two continents during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. Beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species, including <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>, <a href="camel">camel</a>, <a href="horse">horse</a>, <a href="caribou">caribou</a>, and moose, as well as humans. As the Pleistocene came to an end, ocean levels began to rise; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America. In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, true deserts, and the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">gulf coast of the U.S.</a> The elk of southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> including the <a href="Sayan%20Mountains">Sayan</a> and <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> of <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tianshan</a> region that borders <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, and China's <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> Province. The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia is similar to that of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America.

Throughout their range, they live in <a href="forest">forest</a> and in forest edge habitat, similar to other deer species. In <a href="mountain">mountain</a>ous regions, they often dwell at higher elevations in summer, migrating down slope for winter. The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America, such as the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>. Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.

The Rocky Mountain elk subspecies has been reintroduced by hunter-conservation organizations in the <a href="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>n region of the eastern U.S., where the now extinct <a href="eastern%20elk">eastern elk</a> once lived. After elk were reintroduced in the <a href="U.S.%20states">states</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, they migrated into the neighboring states of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, and have established permanent populations there. In 2017, a male elk, likely from the <a href="Great%20Smoky%20Mountains">Smoky Mountains</a> population, was sighted in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> for the first time in nearly 300 years. Elk have also been reintroduced to a number of other states, including <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> and <a href="Etolin">Etolin</a> and <a href="Afognak">Afognak</a> Islands in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. Reintroduction of the elk into Ontario began in the early 20th century, and is ongoing with limited success. As of 1989, population figures for the Rocky Mountain subspecies were 782,500, and estimated numbers for all North American subspecies exceeded 1 million. Prior to the European colonization of North America, there were an estimated 10 million elk on the continent.

Outside their native habitat, elk and other deer species, especially <a href="White-tailed%20deer">white tails</a>, were introduced in areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates. Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat, hides and antler velvet, they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems. Elk and red deer were introduced to <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> in the early 20th century. There they are now considered an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous <a href="South%20Andean%20deer">Chilean huemul</a> and other herbivores. This negative impact on native animal species has led the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature%20and%20Natural%20Resources">IUCN</a> to identify the elk as one of the world's 100 worst invaders.

The introduction of deer to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> began in the middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.

Elk have played an important role in the cultural history of a number of peoples. <a href="Pictogram">Pictogram</a>s and <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s of elk were carved into cliffs thousands of years ago by the <a href="Ancient%20Pueblo%20Peoples">Anasazi</a> of the southwestern U.S. More recent Native American tribes, including the <a href="Kootenai%20%28tribe%29">Kootenai</a>, <a href="Cree">Cree</a>, <a href="Blackfoot%20Confederacy">Blackfeet</a>, <a href="Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a> and <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a>, produced blankets and robes from elk hides. The elk was of particular importance to the <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a>, and played a spiritual role in their society. At birth, Lakota males were given an elk's tooth to promote a long life since that was seen as the last part of dead elk to rot away. The elk was seen as having strong sexual potency and young Lakota males who had dreamed of elk would have an image of the mythical representation of the elk on their "courting coats" as a sign of sexual prowess. The Lakota believed that the mythical or spiritual elk, not the physical one, was the teacher of men and the embodiment of strength, sexual prowess and courage.

<a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> petroglyphs from Asia depict antler-less female elk, which have been interpreted as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance. By the beginning of the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the elk is depicted less frequently in rock art, coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting.

The Rocky Mountain elk is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20mammals">official state animal</a> for <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. An image of an elk and a moose appear on the state <a href="Seal%20of%20Michigan">seal</a> and <a href="Flag%20of%20Michigan">flag</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The <a href="Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks">Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks</a> (B.P.O.E.) chose the elk as its namesake because a number of its attributes seemed appropriate for cultivation by members of the fraternity. A representation of the majestic head of the male, with its spreading antlers, was adopted as the first badge of the Order; and is still the most conspicuous element of its copyrighted fraternal emblem. A prized possession of many members of the B.P.O.E. are jewel encrusted, gold mounted elk teeth – which are actually ivory.

Although breakdown figures for each game species are not available in the 2006 National Survey from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, hunting of wild elk is most likely the primary economic impact.

While elk are not generally harvested for meat production on a large scale, some restaurants offer the meat as a specialty item and it is also available in some grocery stores. The meat has a taste somewhere between <a href="beef">beef</a> and <a href="venison">venison</a> and is higher in <a href="protein">protein</a> and lower in <a href="fat">fat</a> and <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> than beef, <a href="pork">pork</a>, and <a href="chicken">chicken</a>. Elk meat is also a good source of <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>.

A male elk can produce of <a href="Velvet%20antler">antler velvet</a> annually and on ranches in the United States, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, this velvet is collected and sold to markets in East Asia, where it is used in medicine. Velvet is also considered by some cultures to be an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>. However, consuming velvet from elk in North America may be risky since velvet from animals infected with <a href="chronic%20wasting%20disease">chronic wasting disease</a> may contain <a href="prions">prions</a> that could result in a human getting <a href="variant%20Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob%20disease">variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease</a>.

Antlers are also used in artwork, furniture and other novelty items. All Asian subspecies, along with other deer, have been raised for their antlers in central and eastern Asia by <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a>, <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic peoples</a>, <a href="Tungusic%20peoples">Tungusic peoples</a>, <a href="Mongols">Mongolians</a>, and <a href="Koreans">Koreans</a>. Elk farms are relatively common in North America and New Zealand.

Elk hides have been used for thousands of years for <a href="tepee">tepee</a> covering, blankets, clothing and footwear. Modern uses are more decorative, but elk skin shoes, gloves and belts are not uncommon.

Since 1967, the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> have assisted employees at the <a href="National%20Elk%20Refuge">National Elk Refuge</a> in Wyoming by collecting the antlers which are shed each winter. The antlers are then auctioned with 80% of the proceeds returned to the refuge. In 2010, of antlers were auctioned, bringing in over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>46,000.

Falkland Islands

The Falkland Islands (; , ) is an <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">South Atlantic Ocean</a> on the <a href="Patagonian%20Shelf">Patagonian Shelf</a>. The principal islands are about east of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>'s southern <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>n coast, and about from the <a href="Cape%20Dubouzet">northern tip</a> of the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of , comprises <a href="East%20Falkland">East Falkland</a>, <a href="West%20Falkland">West Falkland</a> and 776 smaller islands. As a <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British overseas territory</a>, the Falklands have internal <a href="self-governance">self-governance</a>, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is <a href="Stanley%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Stanley</a> on East Falkland.

Controversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain <a href="Reassertion%20of%20British%20sovereignty%20over%20the%20Falkland%20Islands%20%281833%29">reasserted its rule in 1833</a>, although Argentina maintains its <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20sovereignty%20dispute">claim to the islands</a>. In April 1982, Argentine forces temporarily <a href="1982%20invasion%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">occupied the islands</a>. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20sovereignty%20dispute">dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom</a>.

The population (3,398 inhabitants in 2016) primarily consists of native-born <a href="Falkland%20Islanders">Falkland Islanders</a>, the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, <a href="Gibraltarians">Gibraltarian</a> and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, and <a href="Chile">Chile</a> has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the <a href="British%20Nationality%20%28Falkland%20Islands%29%20Act%201983">British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983</a>, Falkland Islanders are <a href="British%20nationality%20law">British citizens</a>.

The islands lie on the boundary of the <a href="Oceanic%20climate">subantarctic oceanic</a> and <a href="tundra%20climate">tundra climate</a> zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching . They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20Government">Falkland Islands Government</a>, remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.

The name "Falkland Islands" comes from <a href="Falkland%20Sound">Falkland Sound</a>, the <a href="strait">strait</a> that separates the two main islands. The name "Falkland" was applied to the channel by <a href="John%20Strong%20%28mariner%29">John Strong</a>, captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of <a href="Anthony%20Cary%2C%205th%20Viscount%20of%20Falkland">Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland</a>, the <a href="Treasurer%20of%20the%20Navy">Treasurer of the Navy</a> who sponsored his journey. The Viscount's title originates from the town of <a href="Falkland%2C%20Fife">Falkland</a>, Scotland—the town's name likely comes from a <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a> term referring to an "enclosure" ("lann"), but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo-Saxon term "folkland" (land held by <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20law%23Folk-right%20and%20privilege">folk-right</a>). The name "Falklands" was not applied to the islands until 1765, when <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> captain <a href="John%20Byron">John Byron</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, claimed them for <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> as "Falkland's Islands". The term "Falklands" is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.

The Spanish name for the archipelago, "Islas Malvinas", derives from the French "Îles Malouines"—the name given to the islands by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French</a> explorer <a href="Louis-Antoine%20de%20Bougainville">Louis-Antoine de Bougainville</a> in 1764. Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of <a href="Saint-Malo">Saint-Malo</a> (the point of departure for his ships and colonists). The port, located in the <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> region of western France, was in turn named after <a href="Malo%20%28saint%29">St. Malo</a> (or Maclou), the Christian <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a> who founded the city.

At the twentieth session of the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Fourth%20Committee">Fourth Committee</a> determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)". In Spanish, the territory was designated as "Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands)". The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".

Although <a href="Fuegians">Fuegians</a> from <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were uninhabited when Europeans first discovered them. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to <a href="Peru">Peru</a>'s and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.

The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of <a href="Port%20Louis%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Port Louis</a> on <a href="East%20Falkland">East Falkland</a> by French captain <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20de%20Bougainville">Louis Antoine de Bougainville</a>, and the 1766 foundation of <a href="Port%20Egmont">Port Egmont</a> on <a href="Saunders%20Island%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Saunders Island</a> by British captain <a href="John%20MacBride%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John MacBride</a>. Whether or not the settlements were aware of each other's existence is debated by historians. In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony <a href="Puerto%20Soledad">Puerto Soledad</a> the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and <a href="Capture%20of%20Port%20Egmont">captured Port Egmont</a> in 1770. <a href="Falklands%20Crisis%20%281770%29">War</a> was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.

Both the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a> became the only governmental presence in the territory. <a href="West%20Falkland">West Falkland</a> was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the <a href="British%20invasions%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">British invasions of the Río de la Plata</a> during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for <a href="gaucho">gaucho</a>s and fishermen who remained voluntarily.

Thereafter, the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships; its political status was undisputed until 1820, when Colonel <a href="David%20Jewett">David Jewett</a>, an American <a href="privateer">privateer</a> working for the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of the Río de la Plata</a>, informed anchored ships about <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>' 1816 claim to Spain's territories in the South Atlantic. Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants, in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German-born merchant <a href="Luis%20Vernet">Luis Vernet</a> permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago. Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony. Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829, and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers. Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to <a href="Falklands%20Expedition">a raid</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Ship">American warship</a> <a href="USS%20Lexington%20%281825%29">USS "Lexington"</a> in 1831, when <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> commander <a href="Silas%20Duncan">Silas Duncan</a> declared the dissolution of the island's government.

Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who <a href="Reassertion%20of%20British%20sovereignty%20over%20the%20Falkland%20Islands%20%281833%29">reasserted Britain's rule</a>. The <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a> (headed by Buenos Aires Governor <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20de%20Rosas">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a>) protested against Britain's actions, and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman <a href="Matthew%20Brisbane">Matthew Brisbane</a>, returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho <a href="Antonio%20Rivero">Antonio Rivero</a> led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a>, and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant <a href="Samuel%20Fisher%20Lafone">Samuel Lafone</a> began a venture to encourage British colonisation.

<a href="Stanley%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Stanley</a>, as Port Jackson was soon renamed, officially became the seat of government in 1845. Early in its history, Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo-shipping losses; only in emergencies would ships rounding <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> stop at the port. Nevertheless, the Falklands' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the "Wrecking Trade", the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes. Aside from this trade, commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low-value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures. Economic growth began only after the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20Holdings">Falkland Islands Company</a>, which bought out Lafone's failing enterprise in 1851, successfully introduced <a href="Cheviot%20sheep">Cheviot sheep</a> for wool farming, spurring other farms to follow suit. The high cost of importing materials, combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages, meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive. After 1870, it declined as the replacement of sail ships by <a href="steamship">steamship</a>s was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America; by 1914, with the opening of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, the trade effectively ended. In 1881, the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain. For more than a century, the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago; in addition, it owned most housing in Stanley, which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK.

In the first half of the 20th century, the Falklands served an important role in Britain's territorial claims to <a href="subantarctic">subantarctic</a> islands and a section of Antarctica. The Falklands governed these territories as the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20Dependencies">Falkland Islands Dependencies</a> starting in 1908, and retained them until their dissolution in 1985. The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic. In the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> in December 1914, a Royal Navy fleet defeated an <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial German</a> squadron. In the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, following the December 1939 <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">Battle of the River Plate</a>, the battle-damaged <a href="HMS%20Exeter%20%2868%29">HMS "Exeter"</a> steamed to the Falklands for repairs. In 1942, a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago. After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina.

Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century, when Argentine President <a href="Juan%20Per%C3%B3n">Juan Perón</a> asserted sovereignty over the archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a> which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position. In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly%20Resolution%202065">Resolution 2065</a>, calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK Parliament</a>, and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.

Concerned at the expense of maintaining the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early <a href="Premiership%20of%20Margaret%20Thatcher">Thatcher government</a>. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became <a href="Falklands%20War">an armed conflict</a> when Argentina <a href="1982%20invasion%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">invaded the Falklands</a> and other <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">British territories in the South Atlantic</a>, briefly <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">occupying them</a> until a UK <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building <a href="RAF%20Mount%20Pleasant">RAF Mount Pleasant</a> and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of <a href="Demining">deminer</a> casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.

Based on <a href="Edward%20Shackleton%2C%20Baron%20Shackleton">Lord Shackleton</a>'s recommendations, the Falklands diversified from a sheep-based monoculture into an economy of tourism and, with the establishment of the Falklands <a href="Exclusive%20Economic%20Zone">Exclusive Economic Zone</a>, fisheries. The road network was also made more extensive, and the construction of RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access to <a href="Flight%20length">long haul</a> flights. Oil exploration also began, with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits in the Falklands basin. Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009, in accordance with the UK's obligations under the <a href="Ottawa%20Treaty">Ottawa Treaty</a>, and <a href="Sapper%20Hill">Sapper Hill</a> Corral was cleared of mines in 2012, allowing access to an important historical landmark for the first time in 30 years. Argentina and the UK re-established diplomatic relations in 1990; relations have since deteriorated as neither has agreed on the terms of future sovereignty discussions. Disputes between the governments have led "some analysts [to] predict a growing conflict of interest between Argentina and Great Britain ... because of the recent expansion of the fishing industry in the waters surrounding the Falklands".

The Falkland Islands are a self-governing <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territory">British Overseas Territory</a>. Under the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20Constitution">2009 Constitution</a>, the islands have full internal self-government; the UK is responsible for foreign affairs, retaining the power "to protect UK interests and to ensure the overall <a href="good%20governance">good governance</a> of the territory". The <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Monarch of the United Kingdom</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, and <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">executive authority</a> is exercised on the monarch's behalf by the <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Governor</a>, who appoints the islands' <a href="Chief%20Executive%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Chief Executive</a> on the advice of members of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Legislative Assembly</a>. Both the Governor and the Chief Executive serve as the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>.

Governor <a href="Nigel%20Phillips">Nigel Phillips</a> was appointed in September 2017 and Chief Executive <a href="Barry%20Rowland">Barry Rowland</a> was appointed in October 2016. The UK minister responsible for the Falkland Islands since 2016, <a href="Alan%20Duncan">Alan Duncan</a>, administers British foreign policy regarding the islands.

The Governor acts on the advice of the islands' <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Executive Council</a>, composed of the Chief Executive, the <a href="Director%20of%20Finance%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Director of Finance</a> and three elected members of the Legislative Assembly (with the Governor as chairman). The Legislative Assembly, a <a href="Unicameralism">unicameral legislature</a>, consists of the Chief Executive, the Director of Finance and eight members (five from Stanley and three from <a href="Camp%20%28Falkland%20Islands%29">Camp</a>) elected to four-year terms by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. All politicians in the Falkland Islands are <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a>; no political parties exist on the islands. Since the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20general%20election%2C%202013">2013 general election</a>, members of the Legislative Assembly have received a salary and are expected to work full-time and give up all previously held jobs or business interests.

As a territory of the United Kingdom, the Falklands are part of the <a href="Special%20member%20state%20territories%20and%20the%20European%20Union">overseas countries and territories</a> of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. The islands' judicial system, overseen by the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>, is largely based on <a href="English%20law">English law</a>, and the constitution binds the territory to the principles of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. Residents have the right of appeal to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> and the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the <a href="Royal%20Falkland%20Islands%20Police">Royal Falkland Islands Police</a> (RFIP), and <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">military defence</a> of the islands is provided by the United Kingdom. A British military garrison is stationed on the islands, and the Falkland Islands government funds an additional <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>-sized <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20Defence%20Force">Falkland Islands Defence Force</a>. The Falklands claim an <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a> (EEZ) extending from its coastal baselines, based on the <a href="United%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>; this zone overlaps with the EEZ of Argentina.

The United Kingdom and Argentina both claim the Falkland Islands. The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 and the islanders' "right to self-determination as set out in the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">UN Charter</a>". Argentina's position is that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it <a href="Argentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">achieved independence</a> in 1816, and that, in 1833, the UK expelled Argentine authorities and settlers from the islands with a threat of "greater force" and, afterwards, barred Argentines from resettling the islands.

In 2009, the British prime minister, <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, had a meeting with the Argentine president, <a href="Cristina%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Kirchner">Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</a>, and said that there would be no further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%202013">referendum</a> on its political status: 99.8% of voters favoured remaining a British overseas territory. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islanders as a partner in negotiations.

The Falkland Islands have a land area of and a coastline estimated at . The archipelago consists of two main islands, West Falkland and East Falkland, and about 776 smaller islands. The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly, with the major exception being the depressed plains of <a href="Lafonia">Lafonia</a> (a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland). The Falklands consists of <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a> fragments resulting from the break-up of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago. The islands are located in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">South Atlantic Ocean</a>, on the <a href="Patagonian%20Shelf">Patagonian Shelf</a>, about east of Patagonia in southern Argentina.

The Falklands' approximate location is latitude  – and longitude  – . The archipelago's two main islands are separated by the <a href="Falkland%20Sound">Falkland Sound</a>, and its deep coastal indentations form <a href="natural%20harbour">natural harbour</a>s. East Falkland houses Stanley (the capital and largest settlement), the UK military base at RAF Mount Pleasant, and the archipelago's highest point: <a href="Mount%20Usborne">Mount Usborne</a>, at . Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as "Camp", which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside ("Campo").

The <a href="Climate%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">climate of the islands</a> is cold, windy and humid <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime</a>. Variability of daily weather is typical throughout the archipelago. Rainfall is common over half of the year, averaging in Stanley, and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year. The temperature has historically stayed between in Stanley, with mean monthly temperatures varying from early in the year to in July. Strong <a href="Westerlies">westerly winds</a> and cloudy skies are common. Although numerous storms are recorded each month, conditions are normally calm.

The Falkland Islands are a <a href="Biogeography">biogeographical</a> part of the mild <a href="Antarctic%20ecozone">Antarctic zone</a>, with strong connections to the flora and fauna of Patagonia in mainland South America. Land birds make up most of the Falklands' <a href="Bird">avifauna</a>; 63 species breed on the islands, including 16 <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> species. There is also abundant <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> diversity on the islands. The Falklands' flora consists of 163 native <a href="Vascular%20plant">vascular species</a>. The islands' only native terrestrial mammal, the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20wolf">warrah</a>, was hunted to extinction by European settlers.

The islands are frequented by <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s, such as the <a href="southern%20elephant%20seal">southern elephant seal</a> and the <a href="South%20American%20fur%20seal">South American fur seal</a>, and various types of <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns; offshore islands house the rare <a href="striated%20caracara">striated caracara</a>. There are also five different penguin species and a few of the largest <a href="albatross">albatross</a> colonies on the planet. Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus "<a href="Galaxias">Galaxias</a>". The Falklands are treeless and have a wind-resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of <a href="Subshrub">dwarf shrubs</a>.

Virtually the entire land area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep. Introduced species include <a href="reindeer">reindeer</a>, hares, rabbits, <a href="South%20American%20gray%20fox">Patagonian foxes</a>, <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>s and cats. Several of these species have harmed native flora and fauna, so the government has tried to contain, remove or exterminate foxes, rabbits and rats. Endemic land animals have been the most affected by introduced species. The extent of <a href="Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">human impact</a> on the Falklands is unclear, since there is little long-term data on habitat change.

The economy of the Falkland Islands is ranked the largest out of 229 in the world by <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> (<a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>), but ranks worldwide by <a href="GDP%20%28PPP%29%20per%20capita">GDP (PPP) per capita</a>. The unemployment rate was 1% in 2016, and <a href="inflation">inflation</a> was calculated at 1.4% in 2014. Based on 2010 data, the islands have a high <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> of 0.874 and a moderate <a href="Gini%20coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> for <a href="Economic%20inequality">income inequality</a> of 34.17. The local currency is the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20pound">Falkland Islands pound</a>, which is <a href="Fixed%20exchange-rate%20system">pegged</a> to the British <a href="pound%20sterling">pound sterling</a>.

<a href="Economic%20development">Economic development</a> was advanced by <a href="Shipyard">ship resupplying</a> and sheep farming for high-quality <a href="wool">wool</a>. The main sheep breeds in the Falkland Islands are <a href="Polwarth%20%28sheep%29">Polwarth</a> and <a href="Corriedale">Corriedale</a>. During the 1980s, although ranch under-investment and the use of <a href="synthetic%20fibre">synthetic fibre</a>s damaged the sheep-farming sector, the government secured a major revenue stream by the establishment of an <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a> and the sale of fishing licences to "anybody wishing to fish within this zone". Since the end of the Falklands War in 1982, the islands' economic activity has increasingly focused on <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a> <a href="Hydrocarbon%20exploration">exploration</a> and tourism.

The port settlement of Stanley has regained the islands' economic focus, with an increase in population as workers migrate from Camp. Fear of dependence on fishing licences and threats from <a href="overfishing">overfishing</a>, <a href="illegal%20fishing">illegal fishing</a> and fish <a href="Market%20trend">market price fluctuations</a> have increased interest in <a href="oil%20well">oil drilling</a> as an alternative source of revenue; exploration efforts have yet to find "exploitable reserves". Development projects in education and sports have been funded by the Falklands government, without aid from the United Kingdom.

The <a href="primary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">primary sector of the economy</a> accounts for most of the Falkland Islands' gross domestic product, with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50% and 60% of annual GDP; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population. A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government, making it the archipelago's largest employer. Tourism, part of the service economy, has been spurred by increased interest in <a href="Tourism%20in%20Antarctica">Antarctic exploration</a> and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America. Tourists, mostly <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a> passengers, are attracted by the archipelago's wildlife and environment, as well as activities such as fishing and <a href="wreck%20diving">wreck diving</a>; the majority find accommodation in Stanley. The islands' major exports include wool, hides, venison, fish and squid; its main imports include fuel, <a href="building%20material">building material</a>s and clothing.

The Falkland Islands population is <a href="homogeneous">homogeneous</a>, mostly descended from <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> and <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> immigrants who settled in the territory after 1833. The Falkland-born population are also descended from <a href="English%20People">English</a> and <a href="French%20people">French people</a>, <a href="Gibraltarian%20people">Gibraltarians</a>, <a href="North%20Germanic%20peoples">Scandinavians</a> and <a href="South%20Americans">South Americans</a>. The 2016 census indicated that 43% of residents were born on the archipelago, with foreign-born residents assimilated into local culture. The legal term for the right of residence is "belonging to the islands".

A significant <a href="population%20decline">population decline</a> affected the archipelago in the twentieth century, with many young islanders moving overseas in search of education, a modern lifestyle, and better job opportunities, particularly to the British city of <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, which came to be known in the islands as "Stanley north". In recent years, the islands' population decline has reduced, thanks to immigrants from the United Kingdom, <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. In the 2012 census, a majority of residents listed their nationality as <a href="Falkland%20Islander">Falkland Islander</a> (59 percent), followed by <a href="British%20people">British</a> (29 percent), Saint Helenian (9.8 percent), and <a href="Chileans%20in%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Chilean</a> (5.4 percent). A small number of <a href="Argentine%20people">Argentines</a> also live on the islands.

The Falkland Islands <a href="List%20of%20South%20American%20countries%20by%20population">have a low population density</a>. According to the 2012 census, the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932, excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents. A 2012 report counted 1,300 uniformed personnel and 50 <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Ministry of Defence</a> civil servants present in the Falklands. Stanley (with 2,121 residents) is the most-populous location on the archipelago, followed by <a href="RAF%20Mount%20Pleasant">Mount Pleasant</a> (369 residents, primarily air-base contractors) and Camp (351 residents). The islands' age distribution is skewed towards working age . Males outnumber females (53 to 47 percent), and this discrepancy is most prominent in the age group.

In the 2012 census, most islanders identified themselves as <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> (66 percent), followed by those with no religious affiliation (32 percent). The remaining 2 percent identified as adherents of other faiths, including <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. The main Christian denominations are <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> and other <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>.

<a href="Education%20in%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Education in the Falkland Islands</a>, which follows <a href="Education%20in%20England">England's system</a>, is free and compulsory for residents aged between 5 and 16 years. Primary education is available at Stanley, RAF Mount Pleasant (for children of service personnel) and a number of rural settlements. Secondary education is only available in Stanley, which offers <a href="Boarding%20school">boarding facilities</a> and 12 subjects to <a href="General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education">General Certificate of Secondary Education</a> (GCSE) level. Students aged 16 or older may study at colleges in England for their <a href="GCE%20Advanced%20Level">GCE Advanced Level</a> or vocational qualifications. The Falkland Islands government pays for older students to attend institutions of higher education, usually in the United Kingdom.

Falklands culture is based on the <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cultural traditions</a> of its British settlers. It has also been influenced by <a href="Hispanic%20America">Hispanic South America</a>. Falklanders still use some terms and place names from the former Gaucho inhabitants. The Falklands' predominant and official language is English, with the foremost dialect being <a href="British%20English">British English</a>; nonetheless, inhabitants also speak Spanish and other languages. According to naturalist <a href="Will%20Wagstaff">Will Wagstaff</a>, "the Falkland Islands are a very social place, and stopping for a chat is a way of life".

The islands have two weekly newspapers: "Teaberry Express" and "<a href="Penguin%20News">The Penguin News</a>", and television and radio broadcasts generally feature programming from the United Kingdom. Wagstaff describes local cuisine as "very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables, local lamb, mutton, beef, and fish". Common between meals are "home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee". Social activities are, according to Wagstaff, "typical of that of a small British town with a variety of clubs and organisations covering many aspects of community life".

Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo

The Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo was a land battle of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, between the forces of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> (mainly <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States (U.S.) Marine</a>) ground forces. It took place from 7–9 August 1942 on the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, during the initial Allied landings in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.

U.S. Marines, under the overall command of U.S. <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, captured the islands of <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, <a href="Gavutu">Gavutu</a>, and <a href="Tanambogo">Tanambogo</a> among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and seaplane base. The landings were fiercely resisted by the Japanese Navy troops who, outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces, fought and died almost to the last man.

At the same time that the landings on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.

On 7 December 1941, <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">the Japanese attacked</a> the U.S. Pacific fleet at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, initiating a state of war between the two nations. The attack crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet. The initial goals of Japanese leaders in the war were to neutralize the U.S. fleet, seize possessions rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases to defend Japan's empire in Asia and the Pacific. In support of these goals, Japanese forces attacked and took control of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, and <a href="Guam">Guam</a>.

Two attempts by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> (May 1942) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway</a> (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them with an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and <a href="Nggela%20Islands">Florida</a> as the location for their first offensive.

As part of an <a href="Operation%20Mo">operation</a> that resulted in the Coral Sea battle, the Japanese Navy sent troops to <a href="Japanese%20Tulagi%20landing%20%281942%29">occupy Tulagi</a> and nearby islands in the southern Solomons. These troops—mainly members of the 3d Kure <a href="Japanese%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Forces">Special Naval Landing Force</a>—occupied Tulagi on 3 May 1942, and constructed a seaplane, ship refueling, and communications base on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Gavutu, Tanambogo and Florida, all of which were soon operational. Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi, the Allies' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on nearby Guadalcanal. By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi and nearby islands, and 2,800 personnel (many of whom were <a href="Korean%20people">Korean</a> and Japanese construction specialists and laborers) on Guadalcanal. The airfield—when complete—would protect Japan's major base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, and <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> (<a href="Operation%20FS">Operation FS</a>).
The Allied plan to attack the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral <a href="Ernest%20King">Ernest King</a>, Commander in Chief, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">United States Fleet</a>. He proposed the offensive to deny the use of the southern Solomon Islands by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> to threaten the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and to use them as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the objective of capturing or neutralizing the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>, with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines. U.S. Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>—Allied commander-in-chief for Pacific forces—created the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific</a> theater—with U.S. Vice Admiral <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a> in command—to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons.

In preparation for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a> was ordered to move his <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> from the U.S. to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a> in the <a href="New%20Hebrides">New Hebrides</a> was selected as the headquarters and main base for the impending offensive—codenamed Operation Watchtower—with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942. At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Islands">Santa Cruz Islands</a>, omitting Guadalcanal. However, after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, capture of that airfield was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped.

The Allied "Watchtower" expeditionary force of 75 warships and transports, which included vessels from both the U.S. and Australia, assembled near <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> on 26 July, and engaged in one rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on July 31. Vandegrift was the overall commander of the 16,000 Allied (primarily U.S. Marine) ground forces involved in the landings and personally commanded the assault on Guadalcanal. In command of the 3,000 U.S. Marines set to land on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Florida, Gavutu, and Tanambogo was U.S. <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="William%20H.%20Rupertus">William H. Rupertus</a> on the transport ship .

Bad weather allowed the Allied expeditionary force to arrive in the vicinity of Guadalcanal unseen by the Japanese on the morning of 7 August. The Japanese detected the radio traffic from the incoming Allied invasion force and prepared to send scout aircraft aloft at daybreak. The landing force ships split into two groups, with one group assigned for the assault on Guadalcanal and the other tasked with the assault on Tulagi, Florida, and Gavutu–Tanambogo. Aircraft from the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> dive-bombed Japanese installations on Tulagi, Gavutu, Tanambogo, and Florida and strafed and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes floating in the anchorages near the islands. Several of the seaplanes were warming their engines in preparation for takeoff and were lost with their aircrews and many of their support personnel.

The cruiser and destroyers and bombarded planned landing sites on Tulagi and <a href="Florida%20Island">Florida Island</a>. To cover the assaults on Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, U.S. Marines from the <a href="1st%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">1st Battalion</a>, <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Regiment</a> made an unopposed landing on Florida Island at 07:40. They were guided to their objective by several Australians, such as Lieutenant Frank Stackpool (later Captain, <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate%20Defence%20Force">British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force</a>), who were familiar with the Tulagi-Florida area from having previously lived and worked in the area.

At 08:00 on August 7, 1942, two <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s of U.S. Marines, including the <a href="Marine%20Raiders">1st Raider Battalion</a> under <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Merritt%20A.%20Edson">Merritt A. Edson</a> (Edson's Raiders), and the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marines</a> (2/5) under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Harold%20E.%20Rosecrans">Harold E. Rosecrans</a> made an unopposed landing on the western shore of Tulagi about halfway between the two ends of the oblong-shaped island. Beds of coral near the shore kept the landing craft from reaching the shoreline. The Marines, however, were able to wade the remaining without hindrance from the Japanese forces, who were apparently taken by surprise by the landings and had yet to begin any organized resistance. At this time, the Japanese forces on Tulagi and Gavutu, a detachment of the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) plus members of the <a href="Yokohama%20Air%20Group">Yokohama Air Group</a>—commanded by Captain <a href="Shigetoshi%20Miyazaki">Shigetoshi Miyazaki</a>—signaled their commander at Rabaul—Captain <a href="Sadayoshi%20Yamada">Sadayoshi Yamada</a>—that they were under attack, were destroying their equipment and papers, and signed off with the message, "Enemy troop strength is overwhelming, We will defend to the last man." Masaaki Suzuki, commander of the SNLF unit, ordered his troops into pre-prepared defensive positions on Tulagi and Gavutu.
Marines of 2/5 secured the northwest end of Tulagi without opposition and then joined Edson's Raiders in their advance towards the southeastern end of the island. The Marines advanced towards the southeast end of the island throughout the day while defeating a few isolated pockets of Japanese resistance. Around noon, Suzuki repositioned his main defenses into a line on a hill—called Hill 281 (Hill 280 in some sources) by U.S. forces based on its elevation—and a nearby ravine located at the southeast end of the island. The Japanese defenses included dozens of tunneled caves dug into the hill's limestone cliffs and machinegun pits protected by sandbags. The Marines reached these defenses near dusk, realized that they did not have enough daylight left for a full-scale attack, and dug in for the night.

During the night, the Japanese attacked the Marine lines five times, beginning at 22:30. The attacks consisted of frontal charges along with individual and small group infiltration efforts towards Edson's command post that at times resulted in <a href="hand%20to%20hand%20combat">hand to hand combat</a> with the Marines. The Japanese temporarily broke through the Marine lines and captured a machine gun, but were quickly thrown back. After taking a few more casualties, the Marine lines held throughout the rest of the night. The Japanese suffered heavy losses in the attacks. During the night, one Marine—<a href="Edward%20H.%20Ahrens">Edward H. Ahrens</a>—killed 13 Japanese who assaulted his position before he was killed. Describing the Japanese attacks that took place during the night, eyewitness raider Marine Pete Sparacino said:

At daybreak on 8 August, six Japanese infiltrators hiding under the porch of the former British colonial headquarters shot and killed three Marines. Within five minutes, other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades. Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements in the form of the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines</a> (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine, pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine. Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed. Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days. In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died. Three Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.

The nearby <a href="islet">islet</a>s of <a href="Gavutu">Gavutu</a> and <a href="Tanambogo">Tanambogo</a> housed the Japanese seaplane base as well as 536 Japanese naval personnel from the Yokohama Air Group and 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force and Korean and Japanese civilian technicians and laborers from the 14th Construction Unit. The two islets were basically mounds of coral—both about high—and connected to each other by a -long <a href="causeway">causeway</a>. The hills on Gavutu and Tanambogo were called Hills 148 and 121 respectively by the Americans because of their height in feet. The Japanese on both islets were well entrenched in bunkers and caves constructed on and in the two hills. Also, the two islets were mutually supportive since each was in machine gun range of the other. The U.S. mistakenly believed that the islets were garrisoned by only 200 naval troops and construction workers.

At 12:00 on 7 August, Gavutu was assaulted by the <a href="Paramarines">U.S. Marine 1st Parachute Battalion</a> consisting of 397 men. The assault was scheduled for noon because there were not enough aircraft to provide air cover for the Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu landings at the same time. The preceding naval bombardment had damaged the seaplane ramp, forcing the naval landing craft to land the Marines in a more exposed location on a nearby small beach and dock at . Japanese machine gun fire began inflicting heavy casualties, killing or wounding one in ten of the landing Marines as they scrambled inland in an attempt to get out of the crossfire coming from the two islets.

Surviving Marines were able to deploy two <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M1919 Browning machine gun</a>s to provide suppressing fire on Gavutu's caves, allowing more Marines to push inland from the landing area. Seeking cover, the Marines became scattered and were quickly pinned down. Captain George Stallings—the battalion operations officer—directed Marines to begin suppressive fire with machine guns and mortars on the Japanese machine gun emplacements on Tanambogo. Shortly thereafter, American dive bombers dropped several bombs on Tanambogo, diminishing some of the volume of fire from that location.

After about two hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began clearing the Japanese fighting positions on the hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, <a href="Hand%20grenade">grenade</a>s, and hand-to-hand combat. From the top of the hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo. The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.

Most of the 240 Japanese defenders on Tanambogo were aircrew and maintenance personnel from the Yokohama Air Group. Many of these were aircraft maintenance personnel and construction units not equipped for combat. One of the few Japanese soldiers captured recounts fighting armed with only hand sickles and poles. Rupertus detached one <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of Marines from the <a href="1st%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">1st Battalion</a>, <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment">2nd Marine Regiment</a> on Florida Island to assist in assaulting Tanambogo, in spite of advice from his staff that one company was not enough. Incorrectly believing that Tanambogo was only lightly defended, this company attempted an amphibious assault directly on Tanambogo shortly after dark on 7 August. Illuminated by fires started during a U.S. naval bombardment of the islet, the five landing craft carrying the Marines were hit by heavy fire as they approached the shore, with many of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> boatcrews being killed or wounded, as well as heavily damaging three of the boats. Realizing the position was untenable the Marine company commander ordered the remaining boats to depart with the wounded marines, and he and 12 men who had already landed sprinted across the causeway to cover on Gavutu. The Japanese on Tanambogo suffered 10 killed in the day's fighting.
Throughout the night, as the Japanese staged isolated attacks on the marines on Gavutu under the concealment of heavy thunderstorms, Vandegrift prepared to send reinforcements to assist with the assault on Tanambogo. The <a href="3rd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">3rd Battalion 2nd Marines</a> (3/2), still embarked on ships off Guadalcanal, was notified to prepare to assault Tanambogo on August 8.

The 3rd Battalion began landing on Gavutu at 10:00 on 8 August and assisted in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet, which was completed by 12:00. Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo. The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack. In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier-based <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and naval gunfire bombardment were requested. After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled. "San Juan", however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes. The Marine assault began at 16:15, both by landing craft and across the causeway, and, with assistance from two marine <a href="M3%20Stuart">Stuart</a> light tanks, began making headway against the Japanese defenses. One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support was surrounded by a "frenzied mob" of about 50 Japanese airmen. The Japanese set fire to the tank, killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire. The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned-out hulk of the tank, including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots. One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported, "I recall seeing my officer, Lieutenant Commander Saburo Katsuta of the Yokohama Air Group, on top of the tank. This was the last time I saw him". The overall commander of troops on Tanambogo was Captain (naval rank) Miyazaki-san who blew himself up inside his dugout on the late afternoon of 8 August.

Throughout the day, the Marines methodically dynamited the caves, destroying most of them by 21:00. The few surviving Japanese conducted isolated attacks throughout the night, with <a href="hand%20to%20hand%20combat">hand to hand</a> engagements occurring. By noon on 9 August, all Japanese resistance on Tanambogo ended. In the battle for Gavutu and Tanambogo, 476 Japanese defenders and 70 U.S. Marines or naval personnel died. Of the 20 Japanese prisoners taken during the battle, most were not actually Japanese combatants but Korean laborers belonging to the Japanese construction unit. The poem, <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20170920044127/http%3A//vmf-213.com/graves-of-gavutu.html">Graves of Gavutu</a>, written by Frank W. McCullock, memorializes the Marines battle for Gavutu and is part of the Hell Hawk Poems collection. 

In contrast to Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, the landings on Guadalcanal encountered much less resistance. At 09:10 on 7 August, General Vandegrift and 11,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal between <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a> and Lunga Point. Advancing towards Lunga Point, they encountered no resistance except for "tangled" rain forest, and halted for the night about from the Lunga Point airfield. The next day, again against little resistance, the Marines advanced all the way to the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a> and secured the airfield by 16:00 on 8 August. The Japanese naval construction units had abandoned the airfield area, leaving behind food, supplies, and intact construction equipment and vehicles. 

During the battle, about 80 Japanese escaped from Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo by swimming to Florida Island. They were, however, all hunted down and killed by Marine and <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate%20Defence%20Force">British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force</a> patrols over the next two months.

The Allies quickly turned the Tulagi anchorage, one of the finest natural harbors in the South Pacific, into a naval base and refueling station. During the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns, Tulagi served as an important base for Allied naval operations. Since the Japanese exerted control over the nearby seas at night throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, any Allied ships in the Guadalcanal area that could not depart by nightfall often took refuge in Tulagi's harbor. Allied ships damaged in the naval battles that occurred between August and December 1942 in the vicinity of Guadalcanal usually anchored in Tulagi's harbor for temporary repairs before heading to rear-area ports for permanent repairs.

Later in the campaign, Tulagi also became a base for U.S. <a href="PT%20boats">PT boats</a> that attempted to interdict "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" missions by the Japanese to resupply and reinforce their forces on Guadalcanal. A seaplane base was also established on nearby Florida Island.

Except for some troops left to build, garrison, operate, and defend the base at Tulagi, however, the majority of the U.S. Marines that had assaulted Tulagi and the nearby islets were soon relocated to Guadalcanal to help defend the airfield, later called <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> by Allied forces, located at Lunga Point.

The U.S. Navy <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> —in <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commission</a> from 1943 to 1946—was named for the fighting on Tulagi.

George Formby Sr

George Formby (born James Lawler Booth; 4 October 1875 – 8 February 1921) was an English comedian and singer in musical theatre, known as one of the greatest <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> performers of the early 20th century. His comedy played upon Lancashire stereotypes, and he was popular around Britain. His nickname, "The Wigan Nightingale", was coined because of the way he would use his <a href="Bronchitis">bronchial</a> cough as a comedic device in his act.

Formby was born into poverty in the industrial north west of England; his mother was an alcoholic and part-time prostitute, and during much of his youth he was maltreated. To earn money he would sing for pennies on street corners, before he joined a singing duo in his teens. He began to develop his own act during the 1890s and built up a following in Lancashire. He also developed a series of stage characters, including that of "John Willie", which is described by the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards as "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad ... hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through." Formby also had a successful recording career and made the transition from music hall to <a href="revue">revue</a> in 1916.

His health had always been poor, but a stage accident in 1916 weakened Formby's lungs, and he suffered increasingly for the next few years, reducing his ability to perform. <a href="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</a> and <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H1N1">influenza</a>—the latter contracted in the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">pandemic of 1918</a>—weakened his constitution further, and he died of <a href="pulmonary%20tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</a> in 1921 at the age of 45. Formby's act, and one of his costumes and canes, inspired <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> in the formation of his character <a href="the%20Tramp">the Tramp</a>. Formby's son also used parts of his father's act when starting his stage career and, once established, also changed his name to <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a>; Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943.

George Formby was born James Lawler Booth in <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, on 4 October 1875. He was the illegitimate and only child of Sarah Jane Booth (c. 1856–1912), a poor, illiterate cotton weaver. His father, Francis Lawler, a coal miner, was not named on the <a href="birth%20certificate">birth certificate</a>; six months after the birth of their son, the couple married, both aged about 19. Sarah worked as a prostitute; she was small, around tall, and sang in pubs in exchange for alcoholic drinks. She was convicted 140 times for offences that included theft, prostitution, drunkenness and brawling. The marriage was turbulent, and Formby was often neglected, mistreated and suffered <a href="malnutrition">malnourishment</a>. Because Sarah was frequently absent from home, and often detained overnight at the local police station, Formby was regularly forced to sleep outside. As a result he developed <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and became susceptible to <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>. In his later years he recalled that his "childhood was the most miserable as ever fell to the lot of a human creature".

Formby left formal education at the age of eight or nine, and did not learn to read until well into his teenage years. To earn money for the household, he sang on street corners for <a href="Coins%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">coppers</a>; the family's poverty worsened when, in October 1890, Lawler died from <a href="pulmonary%20tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</a> at the age of 33. Formby secured a job at a cotton mill and spent two years as a <a href="loom">loom</a> builder. He supplemented his wages by singing in pubs, alehouses and free-and-easies, the last being places where informal arrangements were made for patrons to provide their own entertainment. Around this time he joined up with another boy to form an act, "the Glenray Brothers" (also "the Glen Ray Brothers"), which was profitable enough to have a manager; the act continued until Formby's <a href="boy%20soprano">boy soprano</a> voice broke, after which the pair separated.

Formby began to develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several characters with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story is likely to be apocryphal. The origin of the Formby name is more likely to have been a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the <a href="Argyle%20Theatre">Argyle Theatre</a> in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star <a href="George%20Robey">George Robey</a>. Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.

One of the earliest characters Formby developed was "John Willie". Baz Kershaw, the professor of theatre, described the character as Formby's "onstage alter ego", while the cultural historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Richards">Jeffrey Richards</a> describes Willie as "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad in baggy trousers, tight jacket, and bowler hat, slow-talking, hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through." His costume included ill-fitting clothes, large boots worn on the wrong feet, and a variety of hats; he would often carry a cane. In 1908 he lent one of his costumes to a young <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> when the latter was touring with <a href="Fred%20Karno">Fred Karno</a>'s troupe; Chaplin also incorporated Formby's cane twirl and duck-like walk into his act.
In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old music hall performer, and they married in her home town of <a href="Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Halifax</a> in August. Little is known about Salter, although the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201901">1901 census</a> shows that she was still living with her parents. The marriage does not appear to have been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.

In 1897 or 1898 Formby was signed to appear at the Lyceum Theatre, <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, supporting the magician <a href="Walford%20Bodie">Walford Bodie</a>; a 40-week tour followed, with Formby earning 30 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s a week. In 1898, while performing at the Wigan Empire as part of the tour, Formby met Eliza Hoy, the daughter of the Empire's cashier. The couple married in August the following year at Wigan Registry Office, although this marriage was <a href="bigamous">bigamous</a> because of his union two years previously with Salter. In the months after their marriage, Eliza persuaded Formby to join the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which helped her parents overcome their initial distrust of him. Formby and Eliza had thirteen children, of whom seven survived: four daughters and three sons. The cultural historian <a href="David%20Bret">David Bret</a> states that Formby was "possessed of staggering consumptive virility", as the comedian also had several children with other partners. Eliza became an important figure in Formby's professional life, making his costumes and standing in the wings during his performances to help him. Eliza also continued working as a seamstress and would sell chips during lunchtimes to supplement the family's income.

In 1902 Formby performed for the first time in London, when he was booked by Ted Granville, the proprietor of the Royal Albert Music Hall in <a href="Canning%20Town">Canning Town</a>, to appear for £3 a week; Granville subsequently became Formby's London agent. Eliza Formby later recounted that Belle Elmore, the wife (and later victim) of the murderer <a href="Dr%20Crippen">Dr Crippen</a>, saw Formby perform, and was so impressed that she contacted Granville and told him to travel to <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> to see the act. Formby soon transferred to the <a href="London%20Pavilion">London Pavilion</a> music hall, where he was immediately successful, and became "an idol of the town", according to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". His popularity increased when <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a>, the influential music hall singer and actress, said that she would only watch two acts: his and <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>'s. Lloyd recommended Formby to the proprietor of the <a href="Tivoli%20Music%20Hall%20%28London%29">Tivoli Music Hall</a>, who gave the comedian a ten-week run. Robey was also impressed, and in 1905 he recommended Formby as the lead in a <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> in Newcastle at a salary of £35 a week. He was able to command £325 a week by 1920.
After the Formbys had lost three daughters to early deaths, their first son, <a href="George%20Formby">George Hoy Booth</a>, was born in 1904. Although the boy was born unable to see owing to an obstructive <a href="caul">caul</a>, he gained his sight during a violent coughing fit or sneeze when he was a few months old. Over the course of 1904 Formby purchased the singing rights to 57 songs, more than his normal annual number of between 10 and 20; the average cost of his songs was around a <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a>. Two years later he made his first recordings, on <a href="phonograph%20cylinder">phonograph cylinder</a>s, for the Louis Sterling Cylinder Company, and in 1907 he signed a recording contract with <a href="Zonophone">Zonophone</a>. He was one of the few performers who had no difficulties recording clearly with the primitive equipment, and he performed in a relaxed fashion for an invisible audience. He would sing his song and then talk to the listener using a variant of his normal stage patter. Some of those songs, such as "Playing the Game out West" and "Since I Parted my Hair in the Middle" have been identified by Dave Russell, the social historian, as "clever depictions of a provincial innocent let lose in the capital".

For much of January and February 1908 Formby appeared in various London music halls for which he received £20 a week. The following year, and staying in the capital, he played three halls a night in exchange for £45 a week. One such venue was the Tivoli with Lloyd and <a href="Little%20Tich">Little Tich</a> as the headline acts. When not performing in London, Formby continued to tour the provincial music halls. In 1910 he again appeared at the Tivoli, and was reviewed in "The Times", in which the reporter opined that Formby "becomes more of an artist the longer he sings". Later that year Formby recorded what would become his most famous song, "Standing at the Corner of the Street", which he also co-wrote. By 1913 his record sales were strong enough for him to negotiate a new recording contract worth £300 a year.

Formby's career received a further boost in July 1913 when he was one of seven acts to appear before <a href="George%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BV">George V</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> in a <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> at <a href="Knowsley%20Hall">Knowsley Hall</a>, near Liverpool. "The Times" reported that Formby's "broad humour succeeded with unexpected ease, and their Majesties praised him very highly after the performance." Formby was embarrassed by his performance. His usual act partly consisted of a running patter with the orchestra conductor, which he again did on this occasion; behind the conductor sat the royal party, and it looked to some that Formby was speaking disrespectfully to them. The king understood to whom Formby was talking, however, and afterwards presented him with a tiepin. In October Formby appeared in his second Royal Command Performance of the year, in a charity show organised by the French actress <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>. He took part in two acts: a performance of "Ten Little Nigger Boys All in a Row", alongside other music hall entertainers including Robey, <a href="Mark%20Sheridan">Mark Sheridan</a>, <a href="Cicely%20Courtneidge">Cicely Courtneidge</a> and <a href="George%20Graves%20%28actor%29">George Graves</a>, followed by a short solo piece.
In March 1914 Formby appeared in "No Fool Like an Old Fool", a 20-minute-long silent comedy film, which is thought to be <a href="Lost%20film">lost</a>; it was his only film appearance, and little is known about the plot or his character. When the First World War broke out in August that year, he tried to enlist, but was turned down on medical grounds; instead he, like many music hall stars, was active in the recruiting campaign for the army and spoke at rallies, particularly on behalf of the <a href="Derby%20Scheme">Derby Scheme</a>.

Formby was always worried that his son George would watch him on stage, as he did not wish the boy to become a comic, saying "one fool in the family is enough". Nevertheless, although he had sent George away to train as a jockey, in 1915 he allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead part of a stable boy in "<a href="By%20the%20Shortest%20of%20Heads">By the Shortest of Heads</a>", a thriller directed by <a href="Bert%20Haldane">Bert Haldane</a>. After the filming, Formby sent his son to Ireland, to continue his jockey training, and also sent the five horses Formby had purchased that year, which joined others he had previously bought.

Formby was injured in June 1916 during rehearsals for the <a href="revue">revue</a> "Razzle-Dazzle", after a stage collapsed onto him at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>. He suffered lung damage and was treated for a <a href="pulmonary%20haemorrhage">pulmonary haemorrhage</a> at <a href="Guy%27s%20Hospital">Guy's Hospital</a> before recovering. Although he was the lead in the show, the premiere took place without him; it was criticised by reviewers, and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" thought that "some of it seemed to have strayed in by mistake out of a second-rate provincial pantomime". Formby returned within a week and the reviews were more positive, with "The Observer" stating that it was "one of the successes of the season ... "Razzle-Dazzle" is now one of the liveliest revues in London, and the most spectacular". By August the production had transferred to the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire Theatre</a>, Leicester Square.
The damage to Formby's lungs from the accident was exacerbated by tuberculosis, and he began to miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the <a href="Southport">Southport</a> Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.

Formby's health was further damaged in the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">influenza pandemic of 1918</a>, during which he contracted the disease while appearing at the <a href="Hulme%20Hippodrome">Manchester Hippodrome</a> and was unable to work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an <a href="oxygen%20tent">oxygen tent</a> was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.

In early 1921 Formby was appearing at the Newcastle Empire in "Jack and Jill" when he collapsed after a show. He returned to his home near Warrington, where he died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 8 February, at the age of 45. He was buried in a family plot in the Catholic section of <a href="Warrington">Warrington Cemetery</a>. He left over £25,000 in his will, listing Eliza as <a href="wikt%3Aexecutrix">executrix</a>. As their marriage had been bigamous, he described her as "my reputed wife Eliza Ann Booth, otherwise Eliza Ann Hoy".

The obituarist for "The Manchester Guardian" wrote that Formby was one of the "great <a href="wikt%3Adroll">drolls</a>" of the music hall whose humour "always seemed to take its rise in a sympathetic perception of human vanities and weaknesses". "<a href="The%20Dundee%20Courier">The Dundee Courier</a>" considered him a great comedian, made all the greater by his continuing to perform through his illness, while the drama critic <a href="J.%20T.%20Grein">J. T. Grein</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>", thought that Formby, "along with <a href="Harry%20Lauder">[Harry] Lauder</a>, Robey and <a href="Albert%20Chevalier">[Albert] Chevalier</a>, formed the leading quartette of the profession".

Formby was the first comic to use a delayed entrance as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would say that he was "Coughin' well tonight!" He also created the phrase "It's not the cough that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!" One of Formby's nicknames, "The <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a> Nightingale" was coined because of the way he used his bronchial cough in his act.

The "John Willie" character, like much of Formby's act, used pathos as one of the comedic drivers, "but it was not contrived and was never mawkish", according to Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, two of Formby Jr's biographers. In his examination of British screen stars, Geoffrey Macnab agrees, and identifies that although Formby's jokes were about himself, "there was grit in the routines, a resolute denial of self-pity". "The Times" examined the performer's style of humour, and considered it "often crude, and always simple, but it was always true humour, and, what is more, it was invariably clean."

Much of Formby's humour was based in his north western roots, particularly Wigan, which he told people was where he was born, rather than Ashton. He would refer to taking his holidays at <a href="Wigan%20Pier">Wigan Pier</a>, which was a small wooden platform on the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a> for loading coal, rather than a <a href="Pier%23Pleasure%20pier">pleasure pier</a>. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" called him "Lancashire's accredited representative on the London variety stage ... clown-satirist of genius".

When he performed in London, Formby would change his act, introducing himself as "Good evening, I'm Formby fra' Wigan ... I've not been in England long"; he slightly modified his stage persona, and he played "the naïve boy trying to fit in with the sophisticated south". Smart and Boothroyd consider that "the contrast between his northern accent and metropolitan bravado was humorous, and the more urbane and sophisticated his audience the more George exaggerated his provincial gormlessness".

Six weeks after Formby's death, his son George first appeared on stage in a copy of his father's act; he initially appeared under the name George Hoy—using his mother's maiden name—but soon took his father's stage name. Formby Jr went on to become the top British male star in box office takings between 1937 and 1943, and the highest-paid entertainer in Britain.

Chaplin, who derived some of his stage persona from Formby's, sailed in 1908 with Karno's troupe to the United States, where he developed the character of the Tramp, the image of which became universally familiar by 1915. <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> later used Formby's humorous concept of "Wigan Pier" in the title of his 1937 study of depression and unemployment in the area, "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Wigan%20Pier">The Road to Wigan Pier</a>".

Formby left over 190 recordings, and after his death "The Times" commented, "There cannot be many people who have not heard at some time in their lives either the words or the refrain of 'John Willie – Come On', 'One of the Boys', 'I was Standing on the Corner of the Street', or 'Playing the Game in the West, songs described by Fisher as "afizz with gaiety and champagne".

In October 1922 a large marble memorial was unveiled at the site of Formby's grave, in the presence of Formby Jr, Eliza and a large crowd. The memorial later became the resting place for both the younger Formby and Eliza. In June 2012 a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was unveiled at Hodgson Street, Ashton, Formby's birthplace.

Domenico Selvo

Domenico Selvo (died 1087) was the 31st <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge of Venice</a>, serving from 1071 to 1084. During his reign as Doge, his domestic policies, the alliances that he forged, and the battles that the <a href="Venice">Venetian</a> military won and lost laid the foundations for much of the subsequent foreign and domestic policy of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>. He avoided confrontations with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> at a time in European history when conflict threatened to upset the balance of power. At the same time, he forged new agreements with the major nations that would set up a long period of prosperity for the Republic of Venice. Through his military alliance with the Byzantine Empire, Emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> awarded Venice economic favors with the declaration of a <a href="Golden%20Bull">Golden Bull</a> that would allow for the development of the republic's international trade over the next few centuries.

Within the city itself, he supervised a longer period of the construction of the modern <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> than any other Doge. The basilica's complex architecture and expensive decorations stand as a testament to the prosperity of Venetian traders during this period. The essentially democratic way in which he not only was elected but also removed from power was part of an important transition of Venetian political philosophy. The overthrow of his rule in 1084 was one of many <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">forced abdications</a> in the early history of the republic that further blurred the lines between the powers of the Doge, the common <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice%23Selection%20of%20the%20Doge">electorate</a>, and the nobility.

Beginning with the reign of <a href="Pietro%20II%20Candiano">Pietro II Candiano</a> in 932, Venice saw a string of inept leaders such as <a href="Pietro%20III%20Candiano">Pietro III Candiano</a>, <a href="Pietro%20IV%20Candiano">Pietro IV Candiano</a>, and <a href="Tribuno%20Memmo">Tribuno Memmo</a>. The reputed arrogance and ambition of these Doges caused the deterioration of the relationship with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, the stagnancy of the relationship with the Byzantine Empire in the east, and discord at home in the Republic. However, in 991, <a href="Pietro%20II%20Orseolo">Pietro II Orseolo</a> became the Doge and spent his reign pushing the boundaries of the Republic further east down the western coast of the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a> with his conquests in <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> in 1000. This strengthened the commercial bonds with the empires of the east, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">Northern Africa</a>, and the Holy Roman Empire, and put an end to the infighting among the citizens of Venice. Pietro II's negotiations with <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20Emperors">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> to decrease <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s on Venetian-produced goods helped foster a new age of prosperity in the Republic as Venetian merchants could undercut the competition in the <a href="international%20trade">international market</a>s of the Byzantine Empire. Similarly, Pietro II had success developing a new relationship with <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto III</a>, who displayed his friendship to him by restoring previously seized lands to Venice, opening up routes of free trade between the two states, and exempting all Venetians from taxes in the Holy Roman Empire.

As the power and reputation of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people began to wonder if he was secretly planning to establish a <a href="hereditary%20monarchy">hereditary monarchy</a>. Their fears were confirmed when his son, <a href="Otto%20Orseolo">Otto Orseolo</a> (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, but his successor, <a href="Pietro%20Barbolano">Pietro Barbolano</a>, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.

In 1032, Barbolano himself was deposed by those who wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople and was unable to return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, attempted to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because he was the son of Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and <a href="Domenico%20Flabanico">Domenico Flabanico</a>, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.

Doge <a href="Domenico%20I%20Contarini">Domenico Contarini</a> (1043–1071) had a relatively uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory that had been lost in the east to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28medieval%29">Kingdom of Croatia</a> in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions in the first half of the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.

What little is known of Selvo's past is based mostly on accounts of his reputation when he entered his Dogeship. Details of his family origins and even the year of his birth are unknown, but it can be assumed that he was a Venetian noble because, with the rare exception of Domenico Flabanico, only members of this class were elected to the position of Doge at this point in the Republic's history. Selvo supposedly belonged to a family in the <a href="Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29">patrician</a> class from the <a href="Sestiere%20%28Venice%29">sestiere</a> of <a href="Dorsoduro">Dorsoduro</a> who were allegedly of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Roman</a> origin, possibly from one of the <a href="tribune">tribune</a>s. He had also apparently been an ambassador to <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry III</a> and he was certainly ducal counselor to <a href="Domenico%20I%20Contarini">Domenico Contarini</a> prior to his election as Doge. Being connected to the relatively popular Doge might have been one of the causes for his own apparent initial popularity.

Selvo is notable for being the first Doge in the history of Venice whose election was recorded by an eyewitness, a parish priest of the church of San Michele Archangelo by the name of Domenico Tino. The account gives historians a valuable glimpse of the power of the popular will of the Venetian people. Over the previous two centuries, the rule of quasi-<a href="tyrant">tyrannies</a> had plagued the popular belief that Venetians held democratic control over their leaders. The events of Selvo's election occurred in the spring of 1071, when the nearly thirty-year reign of Doge <a href="Domenico%20I%20Contarini">Domenico Contarini</a> came to an end upon his death.

According to Tino's account, on the day of the election, Selvo was attending mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on <a href="Lido%20di%20Venezia">Lido</a>, an island in the <a href="Venetian%20Lagoon">Venetian Lagoon</a>. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.

After the funeral, a large crowd assembled in their <a href="gondola">gondola</a>s and armed <a href="galley">galley</a>s. Domenico Tino says "an innumerable multitude of people, virtually all Venice" was there to voice their opinion on the selection of a new Doge. After the <a href="bishop">bishop</a> of Venice asked "who would be worthy of his nation," the crowds chanted, "Domenicum Silvium volumus et laudamus" (We want Domenico Selvo and we praise him). The people, according to the account, had clearly spoken, and with these cries, the election was over. A group of more distinguished citizens then lifted the Doge-elect above the roaring crowd, and he was transported as such back to the city. Barefoot, in accordance with tradition, Selvo was led into <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> where, amidst the construction materials and scaffolding, he prayed to <a href="Christianity">God</a>, received his staff of office, heard the oaths of fidelity from his subjects, and was legally sworn in as the 31st Doge of Venice.

During the first decade of his rule, Selvo's policies were largely a continuation of those of <a href="Domenico%20I%20Contarini">Domenico Contarini</a>. There were few armed conflicts at home or abroad, and the Doge enjoyed a period of popularity due to the prosperous economic conditions. The relations with the Holy Roman Empire were gradually strengthened to a level unknown since the reign of the last <a href="Orseolo">Orseolo</a> through relatively free trade and the good relationship that Selvo maintained with <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Henry IV</a>. The importance of the economic alliance between the two nations became increasingly crucial when the historically shared power of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> and the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> was challenged by the <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">Investiture Controversy</a> between Henry IV and <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope Gregory VII</a>. Selvo had to walk an extremely tight line of competing priorities. On the one hand, he wanted to maintain the trade agreement Venice had with the lands occupied by Henry IV, but on the other hand, Venetians were religiously loyal to <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a> as opposed to the <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>. At the height of the controversy, Pope Gregory VII privately threatened to <a href="Excommunication">excommunicate</a> Selvo and put an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> on the Venetian Republic, but Selvo was able to narrowly escape this by diplomatically asserting Venice's religious power as the reputed holders of the remains of St Mark.

In the east, Selvo not only maintained good trade relations with the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of <a href="Constantine%20X">Constantine X</a> and sister of the reigning emperor, <a href="Michael%20VII">Michael VII</a>. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though the popularity of the new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.

Despite the relative peace of the early years of Selvo's reign, the forces that would eventually lead to his deposition had already swung into action. In southern <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Counts%20and%20Dukes%20of%20Apulia%20and%20Calabria">Duke of Apulia and Calabria</a>, <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>, had spent the majority of his reign consolidating <a href="Italo-Norman">Norman</a> power along the heel and toe of "<a href="Italian%20Peninsula">lo Stivale</a>" by expelling the Byzantine armies. Guiscard was pushing north toward the Papal States (to which the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria was allied), and was threatening Byzantine control of cities along the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian</a> and <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> seas. In May 1081, Guiscard led his army and navy across the sea to <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%281081%29">lay siege</a> to the port city of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durazzo</a>, as it was one end of the famous <a href="Via%20Egnatia">Via Egnatia</a>, a direct route to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a>, the newly crowned Byzantine Emperor, dispatched an urgent message to Selvo asking for the mobilization of the Venetian fleet in defense of Durazzo in return for great rewards. The Doge wasted no time in setting sail for the besieged city in charge of his fleet of 14 <a href="warship">warship</a>s and 45 other vessels. Selvo was motivated not only by his familial ties and the promise of reward, but also the realization that Norman control over the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a> would be just as great of a threat to Venetian power in the region as it would be to their ally in the east.

When Selvo approached the city, Guiscard's ships had already anchored in the harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet under the command of his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a <a href="Golden%20Bull">Golden Bull</a>: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.

The defeat off the coast of Durazzo, though devastating to Guiscard's fleet, had inflicted little damage to his army as the majority of it had disembarked before the battle in preparation of the <a href="siege%20of%20Durazzo">siege of Durazzo</a>. In the coming months, Guiscard would regroup his forces and defeat a large Byzantine army led by Alexios I himself. In 1082, Guiscard took the city of Durazzo, and as the Venetian sailors were forced out of the city and their ships vacated the harbor of Durazzo, the first victory by Venice against the Norman fleet appeared just a temporary setback for the Normans. Due to the new trade privileges and the fact that virtually no damage was inflicted on the Venetians during this siege, Selvo remained very popular in Venice. Meanwhile, Guiscard advanced rapidly across the Balkan Peninsula, but his march was halted by an urgent dispatch and a call for help from his greatest ally, Pope Gregory VII. Guiscard responded by returning to Italy and marching on Rome to temporarily expel Henry IV, but in the process, he lost almost all the territories he had gained in the Balkans. Knowing that Guiscard was gone, in 1083, Selvo sent the Venetian fleet to recapture both Durazzo and the island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> to the south.

In 1084, Guiscard returned to the Balkans and planned a new offensive against Corfu, where a combined Greek-Venetian fleet, commanded by Selvo, awaited his arrival. When the Normans approached the island, the combined fleets dealt Guiscard an even greater defeat than he had received in the naval battle at Durazzo. Guiscard ordered another attack three days later, but the results were still more disastrous for the Normans. Selvo was completely convinced of his fleet's victory and sent all damaged ships north to Venice for repairs, to free them for other uses, and to report of their victory. The Doge then retired with the remaining ships to the Albanian coast to await the departure of the Normans. Acting on the Doge's belief that a third attack would be unlikely and that the presence of a slightly depleted Venetian fleet meant greater odds for victory, Guiscard summoned every floating vessel he could find and led the Normans into a surprise attack. His strategy, though perhaps risky, was ultimately well-calculated as it caused mass confusion among the Venetians, who were overwhelmed on all flanks, while the Greeks fled what they assumed to be a losing battle. Selvo barely managed to retreat with the remainder of his fleet, but not before 3,000 Venetians died and another 2,500 were taken prisoner. The Venetians also lost 9 great galleys, the largest and most heavily armed ships in their <a href="war">war</a> <a href="Naval%20fleet">fleet</a>.

When the battered fleet returned to Venice, news of the defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to forgive the defeat considering the circumstances, many others needed someone to blame for the loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die the next year and the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that moment. A faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by <a href="Vitale%20Faliero">Vitale Faliero</a> based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was sent off to a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the <a href="loggia">loggia</a>to of <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St. Mark's Basilica</a>.

After Selvo was deposed, it took several years for Venice to recover from the defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the immediate impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a> in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>.

At the beginning of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also a monument to the great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee the beginning or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.
The Doge decreed that all Venetian merchants returning from the east had to bring back marbles or fine carvings to decorate St Mark's. The first <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s were started in the basilica under the supervision of Selvo.

By gaining power through a vote of confidence from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a <a href="classical%20republic">classical republic</a>. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that was in the process of moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.

History of the New York Yankees

The history of the New York Yankees <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) team spans more than a century. <a href="Frank%20J.%20Farrell">Frank J. Farrell</a> and <a href="William%20Stephen%20Devery">William Stephen Devery</a> bought the rights to an <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) club in New York City after the <a href="1902%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1902 season</a>. The team, which became known as the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">Yankees</a> in 1913, rarely contended for the AL championship before the acquisition of <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> after the 1919 season. With Ruth in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">lineup</a>, the Yankees won their first AL title in 1921, followed by their first <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championship in 1923. Ruth and <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> were part of the team's <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-AL record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927 under <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a>. They repeated as World Series winners in 1928, and their next title came under manager <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joe McCarthy</a> in 1932.

The Yankees won the World Series every year from 1936 to 1939 with a team that featured Gehrig and outfielder <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, who recorded a record <a href="hitting%20streak">hitting streak</a> during New York's 1941 championship season. New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times from 1955 to 1964. <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>, <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a>, and <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a> were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the field, and the team became a money-loser for owners <a href="CBS">CBS</a> while playing in an aging <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">stadium</a>.

<a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> bought the club in 1973 and regularly invested in new talent, using <a href="Free%20agent">free agency</a> to acquire top players. Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 as the home of a more competitive Yankees team. Despite clubhouse disputes, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually sank into mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, including <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> and <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a>. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.

As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' <a href="Red%20Sox%E2%80%93Yankees%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> increased in intensity as the sides met multiple times in the <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated in the first two rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">new Yankee Stadium</a> and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record. The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason since then is the ALCS, in 2010, 2012, and 2017.

At the end of the <a href="1900%20in%20baseball">1900 baseball season</a>, the <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a> was positioned by its president, <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a>, as a new major league that would compete with the established <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL). The league was reorganized and renamed the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL), and eight cities fielded teams in the 1901 season. A <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28NL%29">Baltimore team</a> had played in the NL through the <a href="1899%20in%20baseball">1899 season</a>, after which the club was shut down by the league. Baltimore was one of three former NL cities where the AL placed teams in an effort to reach underserved fans. The new Orioles' first <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> was <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">John McGraw</a>, who had held the same position for the previous Baltimore team in 1899; McGraw also held an ownership stake.

In 1901, <a href="1901%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">their first season</a>, the Orioles had a 68–65 win–loss record and finished in fifth place in the AL. During the season, there were numerous disputes between Johnson and McGraw over disciplinary issues, which continued into <a href="1902%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">the following year</a>. Rumors began to spread that Johnson was interested in relocating the team to New York City, in an attempt to compete directly with the NL. McGraw left the Orioles and joined the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> as their manager; he transferred his interest in the Baltimore team to the Giants as part of the deal. Several Orioles—including <a href="Roger%20Bresnahan">Roger Bresnahan</a> and <a href="Joe%20McGinnity">Joe McGinnity</a>—joined the Giants after McGraw's departure, and the Giants gained a majority of the Orioles' stock. The league managed to take back control of the team from the Giants; after the Orioles forfeited a game because they lacked enough active players, Johnson ordered that the team be "restocked with players essentially given away by the other teams in order to play out the schedule", according to author <a href="Marty%20Appel">Marty Appel</a>. The Orioles finished last in the league both in the standings and in attendance.

The AL and NL signed an agreement after the 1902 season that ended the leagues' battles for players, which had led to increasing salaries. Johnson sought the right to locate an AL team in New York City, which was granted as part of the leagues' peace agreement. His intention was for the team to play in Manhattan, but the idea was opposed by Giants owner <a href="John%20T.%20Brush">John T. Brush</a> and former owner <a href="Andrew%20Freedman">Andrew Freedman</a>, who were connected to the city's <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a> political organization. They blocked several potential stadium locations, before a pair of Tammany Hall politicians, <a href="Frank%20J.%20Farrell">Frank J. Farrell</a> and <a href="William%20Stephen%20Devery">William Stephen Devery</a>, purchased the New York franchise in the AL. The pair paid for the team. It is not clear whether Farrell and Devery purchased the remains of the Orioles and moved them to New York, or if they received an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion franchise</a>. It was the last change in the lineup of MLB teams for half a century.

The ballpark for the New York team was constructed between 165th and 168th Streets, on <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Formally known as American League Park, it was nicknamed <a href="Hilltop%20Park">Hilltop Park</a> because of its relatively high elevation. The team did not have an official nickname; it was often called the New York Americans in reference to the AL. Another common nickname for the club was the Highlanders, a play on the last name of the team's president, Joe Gordon, and the British military unit, the <a href="Gordon%20Highlanders">Gordon Highlanders</a>. The team acquired players such as <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Willie%20Keeler">Willie Keeler</a> and <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Jack%20Chesbro">Jack Chesbro</a>. The player-manager was <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a>, obtained from the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. On April 22, 1903, the Highlanders began <a href="1903%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">their season</a> with a 3–1 loss to the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>; eight days later, they won their first game in Hilltop Park, defeating the Senators 6–2. New York fell out of contention for the AL <a href="Pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a> in May, falling to seventh place after playing games away from Hilltop Park for a 24-day period while construction on the stadium concluded. With a final record of 72–62 after wins in 19 of 29 games played in September, New York finished in fourth.

Chesbro won 41 games in <a href="1904%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">New York's 1904 season</a>, still an AL record. New York contended for the AL pennant with the <a href="Boston%20Americans">Boston Americans</a> (later nicknamed the Red Sox); Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire multiple players in trades, including Boston's <a href="Patsy%20Dougherty">Patsy Dougherty</a>. Boston and New York faced each other in a season-ending five-game series that decided the pennant winner, and was played from October 7–10. Boston won two of the first three games, which meant that New York needed to win the two contests scheduled on October 10 to win the AL title. With the score of the first game tied 2–2 in the ninth inning, Chesbro threw a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a> that allowed a runner on <a href="Third%20baseman">third base</a> to score, giving Boston a 3–2 victory that clinched the AL pennant; New York won the now-meaningless second game.

New York's performance declined <a href="1905%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">in 1905</a>, as numerous pitchers dealt with arm injuries and conditioning issues. After losing 18 of 25 games in May, the Highlanders ended the season in sixth. In <a href="1906%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">its 1906 season</a>, New York again contended for the AL championship. With 13 games left, the team held a one-game lead over the White Sox, but finished in second place three games behind Chicago. According to Appel, "What would follow would be a string of mediocre to bad seasons and not a very good attraction for baseball-crazed New York fans." New York recorded a fifth-place finish <a href="1907%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">in 1907</a>, with 70 wins, 22 fewer than the league champion <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. The <a href="1908%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">1908</a> and <a href="1909%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">1909 teams</a> finished last and fifth, respectively, and there were multiple managerial changes in the period.

New York had a second-place finish <a href="1910%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">in 1910</a>, but did not seriously contend for the pennant. Manager <a href="George%20Stallings">George Stallings</a> and <a href="first%20base">first base</a>man <a href="Hal%20Chase">Hal Chase</a>, the team <a href="Captain%20%28baseball%29">captain</a>, clashed towards the end of the season; facing opposition from Ban Johnson, who wanted him to resign as manager, Stallings left the position. Chase managed New York's last 14 games. <a href="1911%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">The following season</a>, New York had a sixth-place finish. Early in the season, New York allowed the Giants to play in Hilltop Park after the Giants' stadium, the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>, burned down; the arrangement lasted until June 28, when the rebuilt Polo Grounds opened. Chase resigned as manager before <a href="1912%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">New York's 1912 season</a>; <a href="Harry%20Wolverton">Harry Wolverton</a> accepted the position. That year, New York had a last-place finish with a record of 50–102, the winning percentage of .329 the lowest-ever for the club.

After their first couple of seasons in New York City, team ownership infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him "the most crooked player to ever play the game" because of reports that he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that "maybe the best thing you could say about the ballpark was that it never burned down." By the end of the 1912 season, Farrell was searching for a site to build a new stadium on.

New York started playing home games at the Polo Grounds in 1913 as tenants of the Giants. Before <a href="1913%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the 1913 season</a>, the team gained an official nickname for the first time. Either "Yankees" or "Yanks" had been used frequently since 1904 in newspapers such as the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Journal">New York Evening Journal</a>", since "Highlanders" was hard to fit in headlines. Such unofficial nicknames were common during that era, but thereafter the official name took hold—the New York Yankees.

A third major league, the <a href="Federal%20League">Federal League</a> (FL), began play in 1914 and lasted for two years. While the Yankees did not have to contend with direct competition for fans, as the FL chose to place its New York City franchise in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan, the team nearly lost leading pitcher <a href="Ray%20Caldwell">Ray Caldwell</a> to the rival league after the 1914 season. With the Yankees finishing seventh in 1913 and sixth in 1914, Farrell and Devery sold the team to brewery magnate <a href="Jacob%20Ruppert">Jacob Ruppert</a> and former <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> engineer <a href="Tillinghast%20L%27Hommedieu%20Huston">Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston</a>. The Yankees had rarely been profitable over the previous 10 years, and carried debts of $20,000. The sale was completed on January 11, 1915, as the pair paid a combined $460,000. Ruppert called the team "an orphan ball club, without a home of its own, without players of outstanding ability, without prestige." The new owners intended to spend freely to improve the club's talent level and made a major purchase <a href="1915%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1915</a>, buying pitcher <a href="Bob%20Shawkey">Bob Shawkey</a> from the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>. In spite of this, the Yankees' 69 wins were only enough for fifth in the league. After wearing different designs during the Highlanders years, in 1915 the Yankees introduced white uniforms with pinstripes and an interlocking "NY" logo during games at the Polo Grounds; this remains their home uniform design today. For road games, the team began to wear gray uniforms with "New York" across the chest from 1913; the Yankees still wear similar garb.

Following the acquisition of third baseman <a href="Home%20Run%20Baker">Frank "Home Run" Baker</a> from the Athletics, the <a href="1916%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1916 Yankees</a> had 80 wins and contended for the AL pennant for most of the season, before suffering a run of injuries to key players, including Baker. In the <a href="1917%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees' 1917 season</a>, New York finished in sixth; <a href="Bill%20Donovan">Bill Donovan</a>, the club's manager since 1915, was fired in the offseason. Ruppert replaced him with <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a>, completing the hire while Huston was overseas fighting in World War I. The Yankees contended for first place in the war-shortened <a href="1918%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1918 campaign</a> along with the Red Sox and <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, but lost numerous players to military service and were fourth at 60–63. After the season, the Yankees acquired three players—including outfielder <a href="Duffy%20Lewis">Duffy Lewis</a> and pitcher <a href="Ernie%20Shore">Ernie Shore</a>—in a trade with the Red Sox, the winners of the <a href="1918%20World%20Series">1918 World Series</a>. In 1919, the club made another trade with Boston, acquiring pitcher <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> for two players and $40,000. The midseason deal provoked a dispute between the teams and Ban Johnson, who unsuccessfully attempted to block it. Mays had a 9–3 pitching record as a Yankee, and the team improved to 80–59 for the <a href="1919%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">season</a>; the mark was good for third in the AL.

The 1919 season was the first in which the Yankees played games at the Polo Grounds on Sundays; until then, <a href="blue%20law">blue law</a>s had banned Sunday baseball in New York state. The Yankees' attendance more than doubled in 1919, rising to about 619,000. The Giants soon moved to force the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds, in an effort to secure more Sunday home games. On December 26, 1919, the Yankees made an agreement with the Red Sox to purchase outfielder <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> for $25,000 cash and $75,000 in <a href="promissory%20note">promissory note</a>s. The deal, which was announced on January 5, 1920, was called "the most famous transaction in sports" by author Glenn Stout. After tying for the MLB home run lead in 1918 with the Athletics' <a href="Tilly%20Walker">Tilly Walker</a> (with 11), Ruth broke the single-season record with 29 in 1919. At the same time, he sought a new contract that would double his $10,000 yearly salary. After the trade, Boston did not win another World Series championship until 2004; an alleged jinx against the Red Sox, which was known as the <a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a> (after a nickname for Ruth), was first brought up when they lost the <a href="1986%20World%20Series">1986 World Series</a> and became widely discussed after <a href="Dan%20Shaughnessy">Dan Shaughnessy</a> authored a book with the title. The deal became a symbol of "how things [would] always go wrong for the Red Sox and right for the Yankees", according to Stout.

With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees' fortunes were transformed. Playing on four World Series champion teams, Ruth hit 659 home runs and scored 1,959 runs; both marks are <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20team%20records">team records</a> as of 2018. He is second in club history with 1,978 <a href="run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> and accumulated 2,518 hits as a Yankee, third on the team's all-time list. As well as prowess on the field, Ruth had a larger-than-life personality, bringing him and his team a huge amount of press and public attention. The addition of Ruth helped the Yankees increase their attendance to 1,289,422 for the <a href="1920%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1920 season</a>; it was the first time that any MLB team drew more than one million fans in a year. His skills and charm appealed to large segments of the New York City population; Stout wrote that "He belonged to everyone." New York was the AL attendance leader for 13 of Ruth's 15 seasons with the team; the Yankees became solidly profitable as well, making over $370,000 in 1920 and remaining in the black for the rest of the decade.

In 1920, Ruth hit 54 home runs for a new record; his total was higher than that of all other MLB teams but the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. New York had 95 wins, the most in team history to that point, but fell three wins short of the AL championship and finished third. In an August 16 game against the Indians, a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a> in the head, leading to his death; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland captured the pennant. After the season, the Yankees hired general manager <a href="Ed%20Barrow">Ed Barrow</a> from the Red Sox. Barrow made numerous trades with his former club, including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher <a href="Wally%20Schang">Wally Schang</a> and pitcher <a href="Waite%20Hoyt">Waite Hoyt</a> to New York. The Yankees also became involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson, this time over the replacement of baseball's existing governing body, the National Commission, after reports came out that the <a href="1919%20World%20Series">1919 World Series</a> had been fixed. The Yankees and 10 other franchises—including the entire NL—supported the idea of a three-man committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB, and for a time a move by the Yankees to the NL was rumored; ultimately, Judge <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> was named MLB's first <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">commissioner</a>.

The <a href="1921%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1921 season</a> began a 44-year period in which the Yankees were, according to author Richard Worth, "The greatest sustained winning 'empire' in sports". Ruth surpassed his own record by hitting 59 home runs. He also led MLB in <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> with a .512 mark for the season. The Yankees won the AL pennant for the first time, winning 98 games in the regular season; the total gave them the league championship by a margin of games over Cleveland. In the best-of-nine <a href="1921%20World%20Series">1921 World Series</a>, they faced the Giants and won the first two games, but their opponents claimed the Series title when they won four of the next five games. Ruth suffered an arm infection, which limited his playing time in the later part of the Series. He and <a href="Bob%20Meusel">Bob Meusel</a> participated in exhibition games during the offseason, in violation of MLB rules forbidding players on pennant-winning teams from <a href="Barnstorm%20%28sports%29">barnstorming</a> after the World Series. Season-long suspensions were considered a possibility, but Landis decided to suspend the pair for six weeks. Despite the setback, New York had 94 wins and repeated as AL champions. The <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a> were the closest pursuers, finishing one game behind New York. In the <a href="1922%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, the Yankees again faced the Giants in an all-New York matchup; the Series changed to a best-of-seven format that year. The Giants defeated the Yankees in five games, including one that ended in a tie when it was suspended because of darkness.

By 1923, the teams no longer shared the Polo Grounds, as Giants owner <a href="Charles%20Stoneham">Charles Stoneham</a> had attempted to evict the Yankees in 1920. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, and Stoneham and the Yankees' owners agreed to a two-year lease renewal, the Giants decided against giving the Yankees an extension after 1922. The treatment pushed the Yankees into seeking their own stadium. In 1921, the team bought a plot of land in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, and the construction crew finished the new ballpark before the 1923 season. <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a>, a triple-deck facility, was originally designed to hold more than 55,000 spectators; it was later able to hold over 70,000. Writer Peter Carino called the stadium "a larger and more impressive facility than anything yet built to house a baseball team." At Yankee Stadium's inaugural game on April 18, 1923, Ruth hit the first home run in the stadium, which sportswriter <a href="Fred%20Lieb">Fred Lieb</a> named "the House That Ruth Built" as the Yankees would not have needed such a large stadium without the Ruth-driven attendance. Ruth himself had a resurgence after receiving vocal criticism for his 1922 World Series performance. He shared the MLB lead with <a href="Cy%20Williams">Cy Williams</a> by hitting 41 home runs in the <a href="1923%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1923 season</a>, and had a career-best .393 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>; his performance earned him the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a>. The Yankees finished first for the third consecutive year, and faced the Giants again in the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">1923 World Series</a>. Giants outfielder <a href="Casey%20Stengel">Casey Stengel</a> hit game-winning home runs in two of the first three games of the World Series, but Ruth's three home runs helped the Yankees win in six games for their first MLB title. Off the field, Ruppert purchased Huston's share of the Yankees for $1,250,000, assuming full ownership of the club.

The Yankees did not return to the World Series in either of the following two seasons. By 1925, New York had fallen to seventh place. That year marked the team's last <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28L%29%23losing%20record">losing season</a> until 1965; the 39-year streak of winning seasons is an MLB record. First baseman <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> debuted in 1925, earning a spot in the lineup he would not relinquish for almost 15 years, a then-record <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20consecutive%20games%20played%20streaks">consecutive games played streak</a>. The Yankees made more talent upgrades before <a href="1926%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1926 season</a>, which included the signing of infielder <a href="Tony%20Lazzeri">Tony Lazzeri</a>, who spent over a decade with the club. New York's performance on the field surpassed preseason expectations, and a 16-game winning streak in May gave the team a substantial lead. With a three-game final margin over the Indians, the Yankees won the pennant and a spot in the <a href="1926%20World%20Series">1926 World Series</a> against the <a href="1926%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. After the Yankees took a 3–2 series lead, the Cardinals won the final two games in Yankee Stadium to claim the Series title. Ruth hit three home runs in the fourth game, but made the final <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> of the Series on a failed <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a> attempt.

The Yankees' lineup in the <a href="1927%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1927 season</a>, which featured Ruth, Gehrig, Lazzeri, Meusel, <a href="Mark%20Koenig">Mark Koenig</a>, and <a href="Earle%20Combs">Earle Combs</a>, was known as <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> for its power hitting. The team led in the standings throughout. The Yankees took first place in early May, and by the end of June had posted a 49–20 record, giving them a large lead in the AL standings; by mid-September, they had clinched the pennant. The 1927 Yankees had a 110–44 record in the regular season, and broke the AL record for wins in a year. Ruth's total of 60 home runs set a single-season home run record that stood for 34 years. Gehrig added 47 home runs and his 175 RBI topped the AL; he won the first of his two AL MVP Awards. The Yankees completed the season by <a href="wikt%3Asweep">sweeping</a> the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in the <a href="1927%20World%20Series">1927 World Series</a>. The 1927 Yankees squad is included among the great teams in baseball history.

To begin the <a href="1928%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1928 season</a>, the Yankees went on a 34–8 run and took a sizable lead. The Athletics chased them for the AL pennant towards the end of the season, but New York won the title again and faced the <a href="1928%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">Cardinals</a> in the <a href="1928%20World%20Series">1928 World Series</a>, sweeping them in four games. Coming off a 54-home run regular season, Ruth had three more and a .625 batting average in the Series, while Gehrig batted .545 with four home runs. With the Yankees' run of three straight league pennants and two World Series titles came criticism from fans of other teams, who decried the team's dominance. Calls to "Break up the Yankees!" were made, and critics hoped that the team would sell Gehrig to separate him from Ruth; Ruppert declined to do so.

The Yankees' run of pennants was broken up by a rising <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics%20%28AL%29">Philadelphia Athletics</a> team, which denied the Yankees a fourth straight AL championship <a href="1929%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1929</a>. The team's manager, Huggins, died on September 25. After <a href="Art%20Fletcher">Art Fletcher</a> managed for the rest of the year, Shawkey took the position for the <a href="1930%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1930 season</a>, in which the Yankees had a third-place finish. The Yankees fired Fletcher and hired <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joe McCarthy</a>; in his <a href="1931%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">first season</a> as manager, the team won 94 games but finished second behind the Athletics. McCarthy's team was undergoing a transition from Murderers' Row; new contributors included <a href="Bill%20Dickey">Bill Dickey</a>, who had first played for the Yankees in 1928, and pitchers <a href="Red%20Ruffing">Red Ruffing</a> and <a href="Lefty%20Gomez">Lefty Gomez</a>. Ruffing, who had a 39–96 record with the Red Sox before being traded to New York, ended up 231–124 in his Yankees career.

<a href="1932%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">In 1932</a>, McCarthy's Yankees returned to the top of the AL with 107 wins, enough for a 13-game margin over the Athletics. The Yankees met the <a href="1932%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a> in the <a href="1932%20World%20Series">1932 World Series</a> and swept them four games to none. Gehrig had three home runs, eight RBI, and a .529 batting average for the Series, while Ruth contributed a pair of home runs in the third game at Chicago's <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>. The second of Ruth's home runs was <a href="Babe%20Ruth%27s%20called%20shot">his "called shot"</a>; after pointing towards the center field stands, according to some post-game press reports, Ruth homered to break a 4–4 tie in the fifth inning. Although accounts of the incident vary greatly, author Eric Enders called the home run "the most talked-about hit in baseball history".

The Yankees began cutting their payroll in 1933, as their finances were strained by the Great Depression. Regardless, the makeup of the team was minimally impacted in comparison to the Athletics, who were forced to sell key players to lower their expenses. From 1933 to 1935, the Yankees posted three consecutive second-place finishes. Ruth's performance declined from previous seasons <a href="1933%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1933</a> and <a href="1934%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1934</a>, his final years with the team. The Yankees released Ruth from his contract before the <a href="1935%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1935 season</a>, and Gehrig took a leadership role for the club; he was named <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20captains">New York's captain</a>. New York was beginning to see results from an initiative to buy minor league teams in an effort to reduce the cost of obtaining players; after buying their first minor league club in 1929, the Yankees had a 15-team system by 1937. Players developed in the <a href="farm%20system">farm system</a> entered the Yankee lineup beginning in the mid-1930s, and into the early 1960s this remained the team's primary player acquisition method. McCarthy worked to regulate player behavior in areas such as mental focus and off-field attire; the Yankees acquired a "corporate image" that they retained for many years.

<a href="1936%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York's 1936 season</a> was <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio's</a> first with the club. The young center fielder was signed in 1934 from the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>'s <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a>, and made his debut with the Yankees in 1936, gaining an extra year's experience with the Seals. DiMaggio had a .323 batting average, 29 home runs, and 125 RBI in his rookie season. Gehrig won the AL MVP Award for his season, in which he hit a career-high 49 home runs, with a .354 batting average and 152 RBI. Behind these performances, the Yankees had a 102-win season and won the AL pennant, before defeating the Giants in the <a href="1936%20World%20Series">1936 World Series</a>, four games to two. After a second consecutive 102-win regular season and AL championship in the <a href="1937%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1937 season</a>, the Yankees again defeated the Giants in the <a href="1937%20World%20Series">Series</a>—this time winning 4–1. The <a href="1938%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1938 Yankees</a> had 48 victories in 61 games during one stretch, and won the team's third straight AL championship despite a drop in batting performance by Gehrig. In the <a href="1938%20World%20Series">1938 World Series</a>, the Yankees swept the <a href="1938%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a> in four games. Ruppert died early in 1939; before his death, he sold his ownership interest to Barrow, who took over as the Yankees' president. Financially, the club's position had improved from earlier in the decade; after posting a net loss of around $170,000 from 1931 to 1935, the team made over $1 million during the next four years.

The <a href="1939%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1939 Yankees</a> lost the services of Gehrig early in the season. After starting the year poorly, he ended his streak of 2,130 consecutive games played; he was later diagnosed with <a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>, which forced him to retire. Despite the loss of Gehrig, New York fielded a team that posted 106 victories in 1939, 17 more than the second-place team. DiMaggio was named MVP of the league; he led the AL in batting average (.381) and was second in RBI (126). Ruffing led the Yankees' pitchers with 20 wins. In the <a href="1939%20World%20Series">1939 World Series</a>, the Yankees swept the <a href="1939%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> in four games for the club's fourth consecutive Series championship. Writers have given the 1936–39 Yankees acclaim for their success in regular season and World Series play; Stout wrote that the 1939 squad was "magnificent", and that their campaign was "wholly without drama" besides Gehrig's departure from the lineup. In response to the Yankees' dominance, after the 1939 season the AL temporarily barred most transactions between the last pennant winner and other league teams in an attempt to prevent New York from improving its roster. The Yankees' run of championships ended <a href="1940%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1940</a>; the team had 18 more losses than in the previous season and finished second, two games behind the Tigers.

DiMaggio recorded base hits in 56 consecutive games for the Yankees during the <a href="1941%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1941 season</a>, breaking the MLB record of 44 games that had been set by Willie Keeler in 1897. His <a href="hitting%20streak">hitting streak</a> lasted from May 15 to July 17, when DiMaggio failed to record a hit during a game against the Indians at <a href="Cleveland%20Stadium">Cleveland Stadium</a>. After winning the AL pennant, the Yankees met the <a href="1941%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in the <a href="1941%20World%20Series">1941 World Series</a>, prevailing in five games. In Game 4, the Yankees trailed 4–3 in the ninth inning and were on the verge of defeat when <a href="Tommy%20Henrich">Tommy Henrich</a> struck out; Dodgers catcher <a href="Mickey%20Owen">Mickey Owen</a> was <a href="uncaught%20third%20strike">unable to field the pitch</a>, allowing Henrich to reach base. That began a four-run game-winning rally, and New York won the championship in Game 5 the following day.

The <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> occurred during the offseason, and some baseball players immediately joined the Armed Forces. Most of the Yankees' roster remained with the team <a href="1942%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1942</a>, and the club repeated as AL champions despite Gomez's departure. In the <a href="1942%20World%20Series">1942 World Series</a>, the Cardinals gave the Yankees their first Series loss since 1926, after winning in eight consecutive appearances. DiMaggio and other Yankees entered the military before the <a href="1943%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1943 season</a>, but the club won the AL championship for the 14th time and 7th since 1936. The Cardinals met the Yankees in a <a href="1943%20World%20Series">World Series rematch</a>, and New York won four games to one.

After 1943, more of the team's players were drafted into military, and the Yankees <a href="1944%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">ended 1944</a> in third place, one position higher than they finished <a href="1945%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the following season</a>. A group consisting of <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a>, <a href="Dan%20Topping">Dan Topping</a>, and <a href="Del%20Webb">Del Webb</a> bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over and the return of players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the <a href="1946%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">season</a>. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and <a href="Johnny%20Neun">Johnny Neun</a>), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a> made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. <a href="Bucky%20Harris">Bucky Harris</a> was brought in to be the manager, and his <a href="1947%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1947 team</a> won the AL pennant and defeated the <a href="1947%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Dodgers</a> in a seven-game <a href="1947%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2 million.

Despite contending late into the season, the <a href="1948%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1948 Yankees</a> finished in third place. Harris was released and the Yankees brought in Casey Stengel to manage. At the time, Stengel had "a reputation as a bit of a clown", according to Appel, and had been unsuccessful in two previous MLB managing stints. As the Yankees' manager, he optimized matchups by using a <a href="platoon%20system">platoon system</a>, playing more left-handed batters against right-handed pitchers. Numerous injuries affected the team during the <a href="1949%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1949 season</a> but it battled with the Red Sox for the AL pennant; before a season-ending two-game series at Yankee Stadium, New York trailed Boston by one game and needed a pair of wins. By scores of 5–4 and 5–3, the Yankees won the two games and the league championship. New York won a <a href="1949%20World%20Series">World Series</a> rematch with the <a href="1949%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Dodgers</a> in five games. Stengel was named <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">AL Manager of the Year</a> in his first season. The Yankees faced another competitive pennant race <a href="1950%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1950</a>, as the Tigers joined New York and Boston at the top of the AL. Late in the season, the Yankees broke a tie with the Tigers for first place and went on to win the pennant. In the <a href="1950%20World%20Series">1950 World Series</a>, the Yankees swept the Phillies; the second game was decided by a DiMaggio home run in the tenth inning. Following the season, Yankee <a href="Phil%20Rizzuto">Phil Rizzuto</a> was named AL MVP after recording 200 base hits during the regular season.

Fan interest in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans had the option of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.

DiMaggio played his final MLB season <a href="1951%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1951</a>, while highly touted outfielder <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a> made his debut for New York. Pitcher <a href="Allie%20Reynolds">Allie Reynolds</a> threw two <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>s during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant for the third straight year. They then won the <a href="1951%20World%20Series">1951 World Series</a> against the Giants, four games to two. When <a href="1952%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1952 team</a> took the AL pennant, the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In <a href="1952%20World%20Series">another Yankees–Dodgers matchup</a>, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the <a href="1953%20World%20Series">1953 World Series</a>, and a <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a> base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row. As of 2016, the 1949–<a href="1953%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1953 Yankees</a> are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team since has won more than three in a row.

The Yankees won 103 games <a href="1954%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1954</a>, the most yet for a Stengel-managed team, but the <a href="1954%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a> took the pennant with a then-AL record 111 wins. One year later, the <a href="1955%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1955 Yankees</a> faced the <a href="1955%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Dodgers</a> in the <a href="1955%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. After the teams split the first six games of the Series, the Yankees lost the seventh and final game 2–0, giving the Dodgers their first Series win. <a href="Elston%20Howard">Elston Howard</a>, the first African American player in Yankees history, made his debut in 1955. His arrival came eight years after <a href="Baseball%20color%20line">MLB's color line</a> had been broken, as the Yankees' management had sought to avoid integrating the club's roster. As teams such as the Dodgers added black players, the Yankees turned down numerous opportunities to acquire Negro league talent. Management feared alienating white fans and harbored stereotypes of African American players. Author Robert Cohen called these views "symbolic of the overall arrogance of Yankee ownership and management, as well as their prevailing racial attitudes."

In 1956, Mantle won the MVP award for a season in which he led the AL and MLB in batting average (.353), home runs (52), and RBIs (130), becoming the second Yankee (after Gehrig in 1934) to win a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Triple%20Crown">Triple Crown</a>. The <a href="1956%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1956 Yankees</a> won the franchise's seventh AL championship under Stengel and advanced to a <a href="1956%20World%20Series">World Series</a> rematch with the <a href="1956%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Dodgers</a>. In Game 5, with the Series even at 2–2, Yankees pitcher <a href="Don%20Larsen">Don Larsen</a> threw a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a>. In seven games, the Yankees won the Series.

By 1957, the Yankees had won 15 of the last 21 AL pennants. The team's minor-league system had been reduced to 10 teams from a peak of 22, and its <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scouting</a> system was acclaimed by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>"'s Roy Terrell as "the best in all baseball." Instead of signing many players for their organization, the Yankees concentrated on acquiring a smaller number of highly skilled players, according to head scout <a href="Paul%20Krichell">Paul Krichell</a>. The club recruited players by selling them on the "fame, fortune and fat shares of a World Series pot" that came with making New York's roster.

The <a href="1957%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1957 Yankees</a> reached <a href="1957%20World%20Series">that year's World Series</a>, but lost in seven games to the <a href="1957%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season">Milwaukee Braves</a>. Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California, leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team. Despite their status as the sole New York City-based franchise, the <a href="1958%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees' 1958</a> attendance decreased from previous seasons as the team could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers fans. In the <a href="1958%20World%20Series">1958 World Series</a>, the Yankees had an opportunity to avenge their defeat to the <a href="1958%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season">Braves</a>. The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship. The Yankees were unable to defend their AL and World Series championships <a href="1959%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1959</a>, as they ended up with a 79–75 record, their worst record since 1925, good for third place.

When <a href="Arnold%20Johnson%20%28industrialist%29">Arnold Johnson</a> (a friend of Topping and Yankees general manager <a href="George%20Weiss%20%28baseball%29">George Weiss</a>) became the owner of the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Athletics">Kansas City Athletics</a> in 1955, his new team made many transactions with the Yankees. From 1956 to 1960, the Athletics traded many young players to the Yankees for cash and aging veterans. The trades strengthened the Yankees' roster, but brought criticism from rival clubs. Before <a href="1960%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1960 season</a>, the Yankees made one such trade with the Athletics in which they acquired outfielder <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a>. In his first Yankees season, Maris led the league in slugging percentage, RBIs, and extra base hits, finished second with 39 home runs, and won the AL MVP Award. The 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 12 years under Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55–27 in the seven <a href="1960%20World%20Series">World Series</a> games. However, the team lost four of them, falling short of a Series championship after <a href="Bill%20Mazeroski">Bill Mazeroski</a> hit a <a href="walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off home run</a> in the final game, ending a contest that Appel called "one of the most memorable in baseball history." The season turned out to be Stengel's last as Yankees manager; he indicated that his age played a role in the team's decision, saying, "I'll never make the mistake of being seventy again."

<a href="Ralph%20Houk">Ralph Houk</a> was chosen to replace Stengel. <a href="1961%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">During the 1961 season</a>, both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and <a href="M%26amp%3BM%20Boys">the pair</a> attracted much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow out of the race in mid-September with 54 home runs. Maris continued, though, and on October 1, the final day of the season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher <a href="Tracy%20Stallard">Tracy Stallard</a> into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. Commissioner <a href="Ford%20Frick">Ford Frick</a> decreed that two separate records be kept, as the Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams). MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later, giving Maris sole possession of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a>. The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated the <a href="1961%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> in five games to win the franchise's 19th <a href="1961%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. Maris won another AL MVP Award, while <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a> captured the <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>, having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees. New York returned to the <a href="1962%20World%20Series">World Series</a> <a href="1962%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1962</a>, facing the <a href="1962%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a>. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.

The Yankees again reached the <a href="1963%20World%20Series">World Series</a> in <a href="1963%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1963 campaign</a>, but were swept in four games by the <a href="1963%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Houk left the manager's position to become the team's general manager and the newly retired Berra was named manager. After dealing with player injuries and internal dissension, the Yankees rallied from third place late in the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1964 season</a> and won the AL pennant by one game over the White Sox. It was their fifth straight <a href="1964%20World%20Series">World Series</a> appearance and fourteenth in the past sixteen years. The team faced the <a href="1964%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in a series that included a walk-off home run by Mantle to end the third game. Despite Mantle's game-winning hit, the Yankees were defeated by the Cardinals in seven games, and Berra was fired.

In 1964, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> announced that it was purchasing 80 percent of the Yankees for $11.2 million. The television network bought the remaining 20 percent, originally retained by Topping and Webb, during the next two years. Topping left as team president after the sale; CBS executive <a href="E.%20Michael%20Burke">Mike Burke</a> replaced him. From 1962 to the sale, Topping and Webb had sharply curtailed the Yankees' investment in their minor league system, to show greater profits. As a result, the team lacked capable replacements for its aging players. Other factors affected the club's fortunes as well. The team had been slow in signing African American players even after Howard, and lost the opportunity to sign future stars. As most American League clubs dragged their feet in integrating their rosters, the rapid decline of the Yankees' white stars left them on the same footing as the rest of the league. Also, the 1965 introduction of the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">MLB draft</a>, which allowed the clubs with the worst records to have the first selections, meant that the Yankees could not outbid other teams for young talent. Their trade pipeline with the A's had dried up by 1960, as new A's owner <a href="Charlie%20Finley">Charlie Finley</a> announced his intention to avoid trading with New York. Competition for the attention of local fans had been provided by the expansion <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>, founded in 1962. By 1964, the new club started a 12-year streak of outdrawing the Yankees; the Mets also won the <a href="1969%20World%20Series">1969 World Series</a>.

The Yankees had a record of 77–85 <a href="1965%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1965</a>, and their sixth-place finish was their lowest since 1925. It was only their second finish in the <a href="second%20division%20%28baseball%29">second division</a> since 1918. <a href="Johnny%20Keane">Johnny Keane</a>, who was hired to succeed Berra as manager, was fired after the Yankees lost 16 of 20 games to start <a href="1966%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1966 season</a>; Houk named himself as Keane's replacement. A last-place finish—their first since 1912—followed at season's end, and the Yankees ended up one position higher, ninth, <a href="1967%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the following season</a>. Ford, Howard, Mantle, and Maris all retired or were traded to other clubs between 1966 and 1969. Attendance at Yankee Stadium fell to between 1 and 1.3 million fans per season from 1965 to 1971, and dropped below 1 million in 1972. One 1966 game had a crowd of 413 fans; television announcer <a href="Red%20Barber">Red Barber</a> was fired by the Yankees after discussing the low attendance during his telecast.

After fifth-place finishes <a href="1968%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1968</a> and <a href="1969%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1969</a> (the latter in the newly created six-team <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> division), the <a href="1970%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1970 Yankees</a> improved to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. Catcher <a href="Thurman%20Munson">Thurman Munson</a> played his first full season for the Yankees and won <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">AL Rookie of the Year</a> honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during <a href="1971%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1971 season</a> than they had in 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in <a href="1972%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the season</a>, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth by the end of their campaign with a record of 79–76.

Less than a decade into its ownership of the Yankees, CBS moved to sell the team in 1972. In eight years, the team posted an $11 million loss under CBS; losing money in all but two years. Along with the decrease in attendance, the Yankees' television revenues fell by more than 80 percent from their peak, and in 1973 were more than $1 million below what the Mets earned from their broadcasting agreement. A group of investors, led by <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>-based shipbuilder <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, purchased the club from CBS on January 3, 1973 for $10 million. Despite an initial promise that he would "stick to building ships" and remain in the background, Steinbrenner proved to be a hands-on owner, clashing with Burke and forcing him out of his leadership position. Describing the level of control displayed by the lead owner, investor <a href="John%20McMullen%20%28engineer%29">John McMullen</a> stated, "There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner."

The <a href="1973%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1973 Yankees</a> held the AL East lead entering August, but faded and ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before the building was renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the <a href="Meadowlands%20Sports%20Complex">Meadowlands Sports Complex</a>, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24 million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, and the Yankees were required to play at the Mets' home field, <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>, in 1974 and 1975. During <a href="1974%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the first</a> of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman <a href="Chris%20Chambliss">Chris Chambliss</a> to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.

After the 1974 season, star pitcher <a href="Catfish%20Hunter">Catfish Hunter</a> was declared a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> because of a skipped insurance payment. The Yankees signed him to a $3.75 million, four-year contract. It was the beginning of a long-term franchise philosophy of using free agency to acquire talent; Stout writes that they "were the first team to comprehend what free agency meant", as it provided an advantage over lower-spending rivals and generated fan and media interest. Hunter had 23 wins during the <a href="1975%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees' 1975 season</a>, but the team did not contend for the playoffs after July. New York fired manager <a href="Bill%20Virdon">Bill Virdon</a> in August and hired Billy Martin as his replacement. With Martin as the helm, the Yankees returned to the postseason in <a href="1976%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their first season</a> in the renovated Yankee Stadium, winning the 1976 AL East title by a 10 1/2-game margin over the Orioles. Munson was named AL MVP, with a .302 batting average and a total of 105 RBIs that was second-best in the AL. The <a href="1976%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1976 American League Championship Series</a> (ALCS) between the Yankees and <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> went to a deciding fifth game, which was won by New York on a walk-off home run by Chambliss. The Yankees did not win a game against the <a href="1976%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> in the <a href="1976%20World%20Series">1976 World Series</a>.

Free agency was introduced more fully from the 1976 offseason; outfielder <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, who had spent one season with the Orioles after being traded by the Athletics, was the most significant player available in that first offseason. Steinbrenner signed Jackson to a five-year, $2.96 million contract, giving the Yankees a key player, but one who had difficulty fitting in with the rest of the team. Martin had opposed Jackson's signing, and many players were angered by comments Jackson made that were critical of Munson. Jackson and Martin nearly came to blows in the Yankees' dugout during one game against the Red Sox, in which Martin removed Jackson for being slow to field a ball. The incident sparked media reports of disputes between Martin and Steinbrenner, and further conflict between Martin and Jackson. The Yankees of the late-1970s, noted for clubhouse conflict and on-field success, were later nicknamed "The Bronx Zoo", after a <a href="The%20Bronx%20Zoo%20%28book%29">book of the same name</a> by pitcher <a href="Sparky%20Lyle">Sparky Lyle</a>, and at the time, New York and the baseball world were agog at their antics. The <a href="1977%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1977 Yankees</a> won the AL East and defeated the Royals in the <a href="1977%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1977 ALCS</a>. Trailing 3–2 in the top of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game, the Yankees scored three times to gain a berth in the <a href="1977%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. Against the Dodgers, the Yankees prevailed in six games for their first Series championship since 1962. Jackson hit a record five home runs in the Series, including three in Game 6 on consecutive pitches, against three different Dodgers pitchers. Jackson gained his own candy bar and the nickname "Mr. October".

Before <a href="1978%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1978 season</a>, the Yankees added <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a> <a href="Goose%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a>, even though their <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> was reigning Cy Young Award winner Lyle. By the middle of July, the team was 14 games behind the Red Sox and infighting had begun again. After making comments to reporters criticizing both Jackson and Steinbrenner, Martin resigned and <a href="Bob%20Lemon">Bob Lemon</a> was hired as manager. The Yankees closed the gap that Boston had opened on them, and by the start of a four-game series at Fenway Park on September 7, the Red Sox' lead was down to four games. Over the course of the series, nicknamed "The Boston Massacre", the Yankees outscored the Red Sox 42–9, winning each game. The teams finished the regular season with identical records, and an <a href="1978%20American%20League%20East%20tie-breaker%20game">AL East tie-breaker game</a> was held on October 2. Losing 2–0 in the seventh inning, the Yankees took the lead on a three-run home run by shortstop <a href="Bucky%20Dent">Bucky Dent</a>, and eventually won 5–4. After beating the <a href="1978%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a> for the third consecutive year in the <a href="1978%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, the Yankees faced the <a href="1978%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Dodgers</a> again in the <a href="1978%20World%20Series">1978 World Series</a>. They lost the first two games on the road, but then returned to Yankee Stadium and won three consecutive games before clinching a Series championship in Game 6 in Los Angeles. Pitcher <a href="Ron%20Guidry">Ron Guidry</a> was the Cy Young Award winner in 1978, having posted 25 wins against 3 losses with a 1.74 ERA, and 248 strikeouts. Eighteen of his strikeouts came in his June 17 appearance against the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a>, which broke the franchise record.

On August 2, 1979, Munson was killed in a plane crash. Martin, who had returned as manager after Steinbrenner fired Lemon in June, said that with his death, "The whole bottom fell out of the team." The <a href="1979%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1979 Yankees</a> finished fourth with an 89–71 record. Steinbrenner fired Martin after the season and replaced him with <a href="Dick%20Howser">Dick Howser</a>, who led the Yankees to 103 wins and the AL East title <a href="1980%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1980</a>. Jackson led the AL with 41 home runs and posted a .300 batting average for the Yankees, who finished three games ahead of the Orioles. Their stay in the postseason was brief, as the <a href="1980%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Royals</a> beat them in three straight games to win the <a href="1980%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. Before <a href="1981%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1981 campaign</a>, the Yankees signed <a href="Dave%20Winfield">Dave Winfield</a> to a 10-year contract worth $23 million, a record at the time. The season was shortened by a <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike</a>, and the Yankees qualified for the playoffs by virtue of leading the AL East when the work stoppage began. They defeated the <a href="1981%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Milwaukee Brewers</a> in a <a href="1981%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">divisional playoff round</a> in five games. and won the AL pennant with three straight wins over the <a href="1981%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Athletics</a> in the <a href="1981%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. The Yankees won the first two games of the <a href="1981%20World%20Series">1981 World Series</a> against <a href="1981%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles</a>, but the Dodgers won the next four games and the championship.

Following the team's loss to the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series, the Yankees had a 15-year absence from the World Series, the longest since the time before their initial appearance in 1921. As the 1980s progressed, the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents who were often aging and proved to be declining in performance. The atmosphere of turmoil around the club discouraged some players from signing contracts with New York; they either ignored the Yankees' offers or used them to get more money from other teams. Steinbrenner traded prospects for veterans; sportswriter <a href="Buster%20Olney">Buster Olney</a> called this "a practice that ultimately inflicted serious damage on the organization, leaving the team without the needed influx of young and cheap talent." With Steinbrenner at the helm, the team continued to change managers frequently; there were 21 managerial changes in his first two decades of ownership; Martin served five separate stints as New York's manager.

The <a href="1982%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1982</a> and <a href="1983%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1983 Yankees</a> were fifth and third, respectively. Henry Fetter wrote of the following year's team, which had several aging players, "The <a href="1984%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1984 Yanks</a> had assembled an all-star lineup—but it was that of 1979." In what became a trend in future seasons, the Yankees lacked effective pitching, undoing the efforts of a top-tier offense that included players such as Winfield and first baseman <a href="Don%20Mattingly">Don Mattingly</a>, one of the few star hitters produced by the farm system during the era. Mattingly led the AL in batting average in 1984—beating out Winfield for the league lead. The <a href="1985%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees' 1985 season</a> began with a batting lineup improved by an offseason trade for <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a>, the future MLB career stolen base and runs scored record holder. Mattingly was AL MVP in 1985, with 145 RBI and a personal-best 35 home runs, while Guidry won 22 games. The Yankees had 97 wins, two off the division leader <a href="1985%20Toronto%20Blue%20Jays%20season">Toronto Blue Jays</a>. The <a href="1986%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1986 side</a>'s win total fell to 92, but it was only enough for second place again behind Boston. Mattingly hit an MLB record six <a href="Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a> home runs <a href="1987%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 1987</a>, but dealt with back pain that limited his effectiveness in his remaining years. The Yankees fell to fourth, beginning a six-year streak of fourth or worse. The Yankees had the most wins of any MLB team during the 1980s, but missed the playoffs eight times during the decade and did not win a World Series. Many New York baseball fans chose to support an exciting Mets team. From 1984 to 1992, a period that featured their 1986 World Series victory, the Mets' attendance topped that of the Yankees every year. Despite falling attendance, the Yankees' finances were not significantly harmed, as they had a 12-year television rights contract with the <a href="MSG%20%28TV%20channel%29">Madison Square Garden</a> network that gave them a record $500 million and flexibility to increase their payroll if desired.

Winfield's tenure with the team ended when he was traded in May 1990. <a href="1990%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">The 1990 team</a> lost 95 games to finish at the bottom of the AL East, and its .414 winning percentage was the franchise's worst since 1913. The Yankees underwent a dramatic change in their front office that year, which Glenn Stout cites as a turning point for the club. Winfield had become a target of Steinbrenner in previous years. At one 1985 game, he criticized Winfield by calling him "Mr. May", that is, a player who only performed well early in the season. Steinbrenner also resented Winfield's salary as too high, and was critical of a charitable foundation run by him. A gambler was paid by Steinbrenner "for damaging information" about Winfield, an incident that resulted in an indefinite suspension from then-commissioner <a href="Fay%20Vincent">Fay Vincent</a> in 1990. Under new general manager <a href="Gene%20Michael">Gene Michael</a>, the Yankees allowed their minor league talent more time to improve their skills and more of a chance to play for the Yankees if they were good enough. Michael focused on on-base percentage in deciding which hitters to pursue, and emphasized left-handed batters who might take advantage of Yankee Stadium's short right-field porch. The players developed by the team during its rebuilding years included outfielder <a href="Bernie%20Williams">Bernie Williams</a>, a future AL batting average leader, and a group—<a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a>, <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a>, <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>, and <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a>—that became the centerpiece of the championship teams of the 1990s, and was later nicknamed the "<a href="Core%20Four">Core Four</a>".

After a 71-win <a href="1991%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1991 season</a>, the Yankees replaced their incumbent manager, <a href="Stump%20Merrill">Stump Merrill</a>, with <a href="Buck%20Showalter">Buck Showalter</a>, who increased the playing time given to young players. While the <a href="1992%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1992 Yankees</a> were 20 games behind the AL East winner, offseason acquisitions—third baseman <a href="Wade%20Boggs">Wade Boggs</a>, pitcher <a href="Jimmy%20Key">Jimmy Key</a>, and outfielder <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Paul O'Neill</a>—helped the <a href="1993%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1993 team</a> to an 88–74 record and New York's highest finish (second) in seven seasons. By 1994, the Yankees had progressed to the point where they led the AL with a 70–43 record going into the homestretch of the regular season. <a href="1994%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Their campaign</a> was cut short by a <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">players' strike</a>, which resulted in the cancellation of the playoffs and <a href="1994%20World%20Series">1994 World Series</a>. Many media members believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike. A year later, <a href="1995%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">the team</a> reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">wild card</a> berth, but it was eliminated in a five-game <a href="1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">Division Series</a> (ALDS) against the <a href="1995%20Seattle%20Mariners%20season">Seattle Mariners</a>.

Mattingly did not return to the Yankees for <a href="1996%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1996 season</a>, and the club replaced Showalter with <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a>. Although the managerial change met with a mixed reception by the press, Torre received praise for his handling of players as his managerial career progressed; Olney remarked that he was able to "defuse powder-keg issues and serve as a buffer between Steinbrenner and the players." Jeter won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in his first full season with the Yankees, and Pettitte with 21 wins was second in AL Cy Young Award voting and Rivera posted an 8–3 record and 2.09 ERA as the club won a division title. New York reached the <a href="1996%20World%20Series">1996 World Series</a>, where they lost the first two games at home to the <a href="1996%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> by a combined score of 16–1. But New York won three straight contests in Atlanta, including a Game 4 in which they scored eight straight runs to rally from a 6–0 deficit. With a 3–2 win in Game 6, the Yankees won the World Series for the first time in 18 years. For 1997, the Yankees signed starting pitcher <a href="David%20Wells">David Wells</a> and allowed closer <a href="John%20Wetteland">John Wetteland</a> to leave in free agency, enabling Rivera to inherit the role. The <a href="1997%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1997 Yankees</a> earned a wild card playoff berth, but lost three games to two against the <a href="1997%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> in the <a href="1997%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>.

In preparation for <a href="1998%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 1998 season</a>, the Yankees replaced general manager <a href="Bob%20Watson">Bob Watson</a> with <a href="Brian%20Cashman">Brian Cashman</a>. The club made many player acquisitions, gaining the services of third baseman <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a>, second baseman <a href="Chuck%20Knoblauch">Chuck Knoblauch</a>, and starting pitcher <a href="Orlando%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Orlando Hernández</a>. The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a <a href="David%20Wells%27%20perfect%20game">perfect game pitched by Wells</a>—and by August were 76–27. The 1998 Yankees are considered by some writers to be among the greatest teams in baseball history, having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> and Indians, New York defeated the <a href="1998%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">San Diego Padres</a> in four consecutive <a href="1998%20World%20Series">World Series</a> games for their 24th Series title.

After the 1998 season, Wells was traded to the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> for <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>, who had just completed two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another <a href="David%20Cone%27s%20perfect%20game">perfect game</a> by a Yankees pitcher, this one by <a href="David%20Cone">David Cone</a>, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the <a href="1999%20Texas%20Rangers%20season">Rangers</a> in the <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. This led to an <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> against the rival <a href="1999%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a>. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the <a href="1999%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Braves</a> in the <a href="1999%20World%20Series">1999 World Series</a>. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2000 Yankees</a> had an 87–74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the <a href="2000%20World%20Series">2000 World Series</a> against the cross-town <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">Mets</a>, the first <a href="Subway%20Series">Subway Series</a> in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2017, the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.

Free agent pitcher <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a> signed with the Yankees before <a href="2001%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 2001 season</a> began, and the club pulled away from the Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> interrupted the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">Twin Towers</a>. After falling behind 2–0 in the <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> against the <a href="2001%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Athletics</a>, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. They prevailed in five games against the <a href="2001%20Seattle%20Mariners%20season">Seattle Mariners</a>, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The <a href="2001%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> gained a two-game lead in the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a> before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.

After the 2001 season, several players from the late 1990s and early 2000s Yankees teams departed. New York won their fifth AL East title in a row in its <a href="2002%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2002 campaign</a>, but the <a href="2002%20Anaheim%20Angels%20season">Anaheim Angels</a> defeated the Yankees in the <a href="2002%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. The Yankees' major acquisition in the offseason was leading Japanese hitter <a href="Hideki%20Matsui">Hideki Matsui</a> of the <a href="Yomiuri%20Giants">Yomiuri Giants</a>. Another signing, that of Cuban pitcher <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Contreras">José Contreras</a>, led to complaints from Red Sox CEO <a href="Larry%20Lucchino">Larry Lucchino</a>, who dubbed his team's rivals "the Evil Empire". Tensions between the rivals increased in the coming seasons, and writers called the rivalry one of the most intense and well known in North American professional sports. By 2003, New York's overall payroll had reached almost $153 million, more than the <a href="2003%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">Padres</a>, <a href="2003%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Brewers</a>, <a href="2003%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Royals</a>, and <a href="2003%20Tampa%20Bay%20Devil%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a> combined. Criticism of the Yankees' spending such as Lucchino's was frequently raised; during a 15-year stretch from 1999 to 2013, they had the biggest MLB player payroll every year.

Jeter became the Yankees' captain in <a href="2003%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 2003 season</a>. The team faced the <a href="2003%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> in the <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. The series came down to a seventh game, and the Yankees fell behind before three eighth-inning runs forced a 5–5 tie and extra innings. <a href="Aaron%20Boone">Aaron Boone</a>, a third baseman acquired by New York in a mid-season trade, hit a walk-off home run in the eleventh inning to give New York the pennant. The Yankees were then defeated by the <a href="2003%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> in the <a href="2003%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, four games to two. The Yankees added power hitting to their lineup in the offseason, signing free agent <a href="Gary%20Sheffield">Gary Sheffield</a> and trading for shortstop <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a>, who became a third baseman with New York. Three of the starting pitchers from the previous season—Clemens, Pettitte, and Wells—left the team before the season. Despite the losses, the <a href="2004%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2004 Yankees</a> managed to top the AL East with 101 wins and defeat the <a href="2004%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Twins</a> three games to one in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. The victory set up an <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> rematch with the <a href="2004%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a>. The Yankees took a 3–0 series lead before losing four consecutive games, becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a best-of-seven series after winning the first three games.

The <a href="2005%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2005 season</a> featured an AL MVP performance by Rodriguez, who hit a league-leading 48 home runs with 130 RBIs and a .321 batting average. The Yankees beat the <a href="2005%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> for the division title because they won 10 of their 19 contests against Boston; both teams had 95–67 records. The <a href="2005%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a> defeated the Yankees in five games in the <a href="2005%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">first round</a> of the postseason. The <a href="2006%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2006 Yankees</a> kept at the same level, as they won the AL East for the ninth straight year but were eliminated in the <a href="2006%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> by the <a href="2006%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a> three games to one.

Rodriguez again won the AL MVP award in 2007, as his 54 home runs and 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After starting the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; it was the first time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. <a href="2007%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York's season</a> ended in the first round of the playoffs; the <a href="2007%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a> won the opening two games of the <a href="2007%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and <a href="Joe%20Girardi">Joe Girardi</a> took his place. Rodriguez, who used an opt-out clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275 million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The <a href="2008%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2008 season</a> was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which <a href="Hal%20Steinbrenner">Hal</a> and <a href="Hank%20Steinbrenner">Hank Steinbrenner</a> ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the <a href="2008%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2008 All-Star Game</a>, but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.

The <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">new Yankee Stadium</a>, which cost a record $1.5 billion, was constructed near the old facility. As built, it had a capacity of approximately 52,000, with 52 <a href="Luxury%20box">luxury suites</a>. <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a>, which holds plaques and monuments honoring former Yankees personnel, was built beyond the center field fence; its collection was transplanted from the old stadium. For the <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2009 season</a>, the team committed over $400 million in future salaries to three free agents: pitchers <a href="CC%20Sabathia">CC Sabathia</a> and <a href="A.%20J.%20Burnett">A. J. Burnett</a>, and first baseman <a href="Mark%20Teixeira">Mark Teixeira</a>. New York won 90 of its last 134 games, and broke the franchise single-season record by hitting 244 home runs. Another club record was broken by Jeter, who passed Gehrig as the Yankees' all-time hits leader on September 11. New York posted 103 wins in 2009 and beat out the Red Sox for the division title by eight games. In the AL playoffs, the Yankees defeated the <a href="2009%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Twins</a> in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> and the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Angels</a> in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, advancing to the <a href="2009%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. There, they faced the defending Series champions, the <a href="2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. Behind a six-RBI effort by Matsui in the sixth and final game, the Yankees defeated the Phillies to win their record 27th Series championship.

George Steinbrenner died in July 2010. The <a href="2010%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> won the league's wild card berth, but their title defense was ended by the <a href="2010%20Texas%20Rangers%20season">Texas Rangers</a> in the <a href="2010%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. Multiple Yankees players set individual marks in 2011. Jeter joined the <a href="3%2C000%20hit%20club">3,000 hit club</a> on July 9; he was the first player to do so while playing for the club. Later in the season, Rivera posted the 602nd save of his career, breaking the all-time record that had been held by <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a>. The Yankees won the AL East, but lost in the <a href="2011%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> to the Tigers. Rivera suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee in May 2012 while catching fly balls before a game against the Royals. Even without their longtime closer, the <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2012 Yankees</a> gained a 10-game lead by mid-July, and held off the <a href="2012%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> to win the division title by a final margin of two games. After defeating the Orioles in a five-game <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>, the Yankees were swept by the Tigers in the <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>.

During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter broke his right ankle while attempting to field a ball. He was one of many Yankees to miss playing time during the club's <a href="2013%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2013 campaign</a>; 20 players were placed on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> at least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason, second baseman <a href="Robinson%20Can%C3%B3">Robinson Canó</a> departed New York for the Mariners in free agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher <a href="Masahiro%20Tanaka">Masahiro Tanaka</a>, who was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's <a href="Tohoku%20Rakuten%20Golden%20Eagles">Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles</a>, to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The <a href="2014%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2014 Yankees</a>, the last with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored. The offense improved <a href="2015%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">in 2015</a>, ending the regular season with the second-most runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, but was defeated by the <a href="2015%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston Astros</a> in a <a href="2015%20American%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">one-game playoff</a>. The Yankees traded several veteran players during <a href="2016%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">their 2016 season</a> and received top prospects <a href="Gleyber%20Torres">Gleyber Torres</a>, <a href="Clint%20Frazier">Clint Frazier</a>, and <a href="Justus%20Sheffield">Justus Sheffield</a> in return. In August 2016, Rodriguez was released from his contract and retained as a special advisor.The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs for the third time in four years. As the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40 percent from 2009 to 2016.

The <a href="2017%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2017 Yankees</a> featured a group of young players who became known as the "Baby Bombers". Among them were outfielder <a href="Aaron%20Judge">Aaron Judge</a>, catcher <a href="Gary%20S%C3%A1nchez">Gary Sánchez</a>, starting pitcher <a href="Luis%20Severino">Luis Severino</a>, and first baseman <a href="Greg%20Bird%20%28baseball%29">Greg Bird</a>. Judge hit a league-leading 52 home runs, the most ever by a rookie; he was the AL MVP runner-up and won AL Rookie of the Year honors. New York earned a postseason berth and reached the <a href="2017%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> by beating the <a href="2017%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Twins</a> in the <a href="2017%20American%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">AL wild card game</a>. The <a href="2017%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a> gained a two-game lead in the ALDS, but the Yankees won three consecutive times to advance to the <a href="2017%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. Against the <a href="2017%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Astros</a>, the Yankees lost in seven games. After 10 years as the team's manager, Girardi was replaced by Boone. New York acquired outfielder <a href="Giancarlo%20Stanton">Giancarlo Stanton</a>, the 2017 NL MVP, in an offseason trade with the Marlins. Stanton had 38 of the 267 home runs hit by the <a href="2018%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees in 2018</a>, as the club set an MLB single-season record. They again qualified for the playoffs and made it to the <a href="2018%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>, where they faced the Red Sox. The Yankees were defeated three games to one by their rivals, falling short of a return to the ALCS.

As of 2018, the Yankees' 27 World Series championships are 16 more than the number won by the St. Louis Cardinals, who have the second-most titles among MLB teams. New York's championship total is the highest of any franchise in major North American professional sports; the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>'s <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> are second behind the Yankees with 24 <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> wins. The 40 American League titles, or pennants, won by the Yankees places them 17 in front of the Cardinals for the most pennants won by an MLB team. The Giants and Dodgers are the only other clubs with 20 or more pennants. The <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> has <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20in%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">inducted over 40 players and managers</a> who have worn Yankees pinstripes, with two more--<a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> and <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a>--forthcoming in August 2019. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine has labeled the Yankees the most valuable team in baseball every year since 1998; the franchise was worth an estimated $4 billion in 2018.

Brockway Mountain Drive

Brockway Mountain Drive is an <a href="scenic%20highway">scenic roadway</a> just west of <a href="Copper%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Copper Harbor</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> in the United States. Drivers can access the road from state highway <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a> on either end near <a href="Eagle%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Eagle Harbor</a> to the west or Copper Harbor to the east in the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a>. The drive runs along the ridge of Brockway Mountain on the <a href="Keweenaw%20Fault">Keweenaw Fault</a> and climbs to above sea level, above the surface of <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. Several viewpoints along the route allow for panoramas of Copper Harbor, Lake Superior, and undeveloped woodland. On a clear day, <a href="Isle%20Royale">Isle Royale</a> is visible approximately in distance from the top of the mountain.

Brockway Mountain was named for Daniel D. Brockway, one of the pioneer residents of the area. The road was constructed by the county road commission with funding through <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>-era work programs in 1933. It was briefly used as a connection for the parallel state highway after it opened. Since it opened, Brockway Mountain Drive has been recognized nationally and locally in several media outlets for its picturesque qualities, usually in profiles of <a href="Keweenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Keweenaw County</a>, the Upper Peninsula or other scenic drives.

The road can be accessed from either Eagle Harbor or Copper Harbor and serves as a scenic loop off M-26. The western end starts at M-26 near Lake Bailey and Agate Harbor. Brockway Mountain Drive ascends along the ridgeline of the Keweenaw Fault. Immediately south of the road, Upson Creek runs parallel to the cliff face as it drains Lake Upson. from the western end, there is a parking area for the Oren Krumm Trail, part of the Brockway Mountain Audubon Sanctuary. The drive is lined with low stone walls, built as part of the original construction of the roadway.
Upon reaching the top of the mountain, drivers are greeted with a full panoramic view of the surrounding area, allowing views of Lake Superior, Copper Harbor, Eagle Harbor and the surrounding lakes and forests. Freighters occasionally can be seen traversing Lake Superior, and on clear days <a href="Isle%20Royale">Isle Royale</a> can be spotted nearly in the distance.

Continuing eastward, the drive descends down the mountain toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to the face of the bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp <a href="hairpin%20turn">hairpin turn</a>s, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby <a href="Copper%20Country%20Trail">Copper Country Trail</a> National Scenic Byway portion of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 41</a> (US 41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.
This road is one of the highest scenic roadways <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a> in the US between the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky</a> and <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Allegheny</a> mountains. During the winter, Brockway Mountain Drive is closed to cars as the <a href="Keweenaw%20County%20Road%20Commission">Keweenaw County Road Commission</a> does not plow the road; instead the drive is used as a snowmobile trail. According to the commission, 200 vehicles per day use the roadway on average. There are no posted speed limits along the roadway, however in the words of a former Keweenaw County Sheriff's Department deputy, "the nature and design of the road was such that the 'problem' of people driving too fast ... was basically 'self-correcting'."

Brockway Mountain is a volcanic landform on the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a> of Michigan about west of Copper Harbor. The top of the mountain is above the level of Lake Superior. The peak was named for Daniel D. Brockway, local pioneer settler, postmaster and state road commissioner. Brockway moved to Copper Harbor in 1846 at the beginning of the area's copper boom. He built the first permanent structure in the community, a hostelry named The Brockway House, which was used by the miners and scientists in the area. By the time of his death on May 9, 1899, the ridge west of town had been named in his honor.

A road to the summit of Brockway Mountain was first proposed in the 1920s by <a href="Warren%20H.%20Manning">Warren H. Manning</a>, a renowned landscape architect. Manning was in the Keweenaw at the time to design Agassiz Park in <a href="Calumet%2C%20Michigan">Calumet</a> and suggested the road while visiting the area. The road was designed in 1932 with three different options considered. The first involved the construction of the current road from near the Silver River on the west to the summit. It followed a route used by the previous <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan%23Military%20Road">Military Road</a> that connected <a href="Fort%20Wilkins">Fort Wilkins</a> to <a href="Fort%20Howard%20%28Wisconsin%29">Fort Howard</a>; traffic would have to turn around to descend Brockway Mountain. Another option included a route from the summit southwest across the Upson Creek Valley to a second summit on the nearby Mount Lookout, a total of about . The third option was that of the current route down the mountain to the west.
Construction of Brockway Mountain Drive began in early 1933 by the Keweenaw County Road Commission with federal highway funding designed to provide meaningful work to the many copper miners who became unemployed during the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20States">Great Depression</a>. Rather than provide welfare, the government provided work for the jobless. The <a href="Reconstruction%20Finance%20Corporation">Reconstruction Finance Corporation</a> was the agency on the federal level responsible for the project. Up to 300 laborers were employed for a wage of 25<a href="Cent%20%28currency%29">¢</a>/hr (equivalent to $/hr in ). The work required to build the road was carried out by manual labor, with the assistance of a team of horses, in a project designed to maximize the numbers of men employed. The grading and leveling of the road surface was done by hand; no survey instruments were used to level the roadway. The road was opened for public use that October 14, at a preliminary cost of $30,000 (equivalent to $ in ). That same year, the Skytop Inn opened on top of the mountain. During 1934, additional work was done to the roadway to build the stone walls. Motorists were restricted to one-way traffic, and the road was only open to the public on Sundays and holidays. In the interim, the road was temporarily used as a connection between completed segments of the parallel state highway, numbered <a href="M-129%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-129</a> at the time. This highway, now part of M-26, was built starting in July 1933 but was not completed through the area until October 1934. The KCRC declared the road initially finished on June 14, 1935, at a cost of $40,000 (equivalent to $ in )
According to historian LeRoy Barnett, "this county highway quickly became one of the most popular motoring destinations in the Midwest." The "<a href="Ironwood%20Daily%20Globe">Ironwood Daily Globe</a>" reported that in December 1938, "at least one million persons" had traveled on Brockway Mountain Drive in the first five years it was open, sparking a tourism boom in the area. The eastern end of the roadway was paved in 1938, with the final done in 1940. The first Skytop Inn was built at the summit of Brockway Mountain in 1935. A replacement structure was built in 1965. During the first few winters of 1946/47 and 1947/48, a ski hill was operated down the roadway on the western end.

In February 2013, <a href="Eagle%20Harbor%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Eagle Harbor Township</a> purchased at the top of Brockway Mountain with plans to refit the Skytop Inn to serve as a visitors center. The building was the oldest gift shop in Keweenaw County and owned by the same family from the time of its construction until it was sold in 2013. The following August, Governor <a href="Rick%20Snyder">Rick Snyder</a> helped to dedicate the summit as part of the Keweenaw Coastal Wildlife Corridor, a protected area in the raptors' annual migration flight path. The area is now owned by the township after assistance by <a href="The%20Nature%20Conservancy">The Nature Conservancy</a> and local donors.

During the spring, particularly in April, hawks migrate along the length of the Keweenaw Peninsula headed across Lake Superior. They flock together along the cliffs and ridges of Brockway Mountain. The top of the mountain is a semi-<a href="alpine%20climate">alpine climate</a> with strong winds, and guide books advise visitors to bring windbreaker jackets, even in the summer. The peak is also known as an excellent star-gazing location because there are no electric lights to interrupt the darkness. The surrounding mountainsides are privately owned, mostly by <a href="Champion%20International%20Paper">Champion International Paper</a>. The company receives reduced taxes in exchange for keeping the land open for recreational uses. The <a href="Michigan%20Nature%20Association">Michigan Nature Association</a> owns of property on Brockway Mountain itself. There are over 700 species of flowers including <a href="trillium">trillium</a> and <a href="orchids">orchids</a>. The peak bloom is in June, and some of the wildflowers on display are not found elsewhere in the state. "Motorcycle Cruiser" magazine featured a piece on Copper Harbor in February 2010 that suggested visiting Brockway Mountain at dawn saying that "the vista at the peak is amazing and it's worth the early morning rise." The area is renowned as a fall foliage destination; color season starts by the second week of September and ends in October.

Many locales in the Keweenaw Peninsula are frequently praised for their beauty and pristine appearances and Brockway Mountain Drive is no exception. The road has been recognized in numerous publications, dating back to the 1950s. The "<a href="Milwaukee%20Sentinel">Milwaukee Sentinel</a>" profiled the "famous Brockway Mountain Drive" in 1956 in an article about a tourism boom to the region. More attention was focused on the roadway when Milwaukee's other newspaper, the "<a href="Milwaukee%20Journal">Milwaukee Journal</a>", spotlighted the region in 1961 stating, "the road along the Brockway Mountain fault follows the Keweenaw Peninsula above Lake Superior, past ghost copper mines [toward] restored Fort Wilkins". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" had similar praise in 1962, saying "a side trip that should not be missed is the Brockway Mountain Drive ... for a panoramic view of the forest and the blue waters of Lake Superior." The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" called the overlook "breathtaking" in 1986, and the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" said that views from Brockway "rival[ed] any in New England" in 1990. The "<a href="St.%20Paul%20Pioneer%20Press">Pioneer Press</a>" of St. Paul profiled the area in 2005 saying that the tourists "cruise along Brockway Mountain Drive, renowned for fall color." The staff of "MLive", the online news presence of <a href="Booth%20Newspapers">Booth Newspapers</a> in Michigan, highlighted the height of the roadway, the view to Isle Royale, and the birdwatching opportunities in a profile of the area in 2007.

In April 1994 and April 2001, the route along US 41 and Brockway Mountain Drive was selected as "one of the best fall color views and mountain biking areas" by "Michigan Living". It was also named the "most beautiful bike ride in the United States" by "<a href="Bicycling%20%28magazine%29">Bicycling</a>" magazine in February 1995. The "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" in Minneapolis said that a visit to the drive "is worth the whole trip by itself, with a twisting road leading up to the crest, with panoramic views of fall colors."
The drive was also included in the coverage of the <a href="Copper%20Country%20Trail">Copper Country Trail</a>, a designation applied to the neighboring US 41 by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> as a part of the <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byway">National Scenic Byway</a> program. <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today</a>" featured Brockway Mountain Drive in September 2007 as part of a segment on "great and unusual fall foliage destinations". In May 2010, local residents of the Upper Peninsula chose the road as the region's "favorite natural wonder" in a poll conducted by <a href="WLUC-TV">WLUC-TV</a>. Brockway Mountain Drive was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on July 24, 2017.

Management of multiple sclerosis

<a href="Multiple%20sclerosis">Multiple sclerosis</a> (MS) is a <a href="chronic%20%28medical%29">chronic</a> <a href="Inflammation">inflammatory</a> <a href="demyelinating%20disease">demyelinating disease</a> that affects the <a href="Central%20Nervous%20System">central nervous system</a> (CNS). Several therapies for it exist, although there is no known cure.

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks (<a href="relapse">relapse</a>s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a <a href="diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.

The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several <a href="adverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29">adverse effects</a>, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different <a href="Alternative%20medicine">alternative treatments</a> are pursued by many people, despite the fact that there is little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; <a href="idiopathic%20inflammatory%20demyelinating%20diseases">borderline forms of MS</a> have particular treatments that are excluded.
Administration of high doses of <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenous</a> <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a>s, such as <a href="methylprednisolone">methylprednisolone</a>, is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a> in promoting a faster recovery from <a href="disability">disability</a> after an attack. There is however insufficient evidence to indicate any significant impact on long-term disability of corticosteroid treatments. Steroids administered orally have a similar effectiveness and safety profile at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. Consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by <a href="plasmapheresis">plasmapheresis</a>.

As of 2017, several disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), the <a href="European%20Medicines%20Agency">European Medicines Agency</a> (EMEA) and the <a href="Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Medical%20Devices%20Agency">Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency</a> (PMDA) of the Japanese <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%2C%20Labour%20and%20Welfare%20%28Japan%29">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>.

Medications approved by the FDA include currently eleven medications: interferons <a href="interferon%20beta-1a">beta-1a</a> and <a href="interferon%20beta-1b">beta-1b</a>, four monoclonal antibodies: <a href="natalizumab">natalizumab</a>, <a href="alemtuzumab">alemtuzumab</a>, <a href="daclizumab">daclizumab</a> and <a href="ocrelizumab">ocrelizumab</a>, and five immunomodulators: <a href="glatiramer%20acetate">glatiramer acetate</a>, <a href="mitoxantrone">mitoxantrone</a>, <a href="fingolimod">fingolimod</a>, <a href="teriflunomide">teriflunomide</a>, <a href="dimethyl%20fumarate">dimethyl fumarate</a>.

In 1993 interferon beta-1b was the first drug to ever be approved for MS, being soon followed by interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate.

Interferon beta-1a is injected either weekly (<a href="intramuscular%20injection">intramuscular injection</a>) or three times a week (<a href="subcutaneous%20injection">subcutaneous injection</a>) depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b is injected subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a pegylated form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with the brand name Plegridy, which is available as a subcutaneous injection. This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks. <a href="Interferon%20beta">Interferon beta</a> balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of <a href="nerve%20growth%20factor">nerve growth factor</a> and consequently improve neuronal survival.

Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random polymers of four amino acids which is antigenically similar to the <a href="myelin%20basic%20protein">myelin basic protein</a>, a component of the myelin sheath of nerves with which it competes for presentation to T cells . It is injected subcutaneously on a daily basis.

Mitoxantrone is an <a href="immunosuppressant">immunosuppressant</a> also used in <a href="chemotherapy">cancer chemotherapy</a> which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a <a href="Monoclonal%20antibodies">monoclonal antibody</a> that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.

In 2010 <a href="fingolimod">fingolimod</a>, a <a href="S1PR1">sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor</a> modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by <a href="teriflunomide">teriflunomide</a>, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a> and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of <a href="fumaric%20acid">fumaric acid</a>, an already existing drug), was approved by the FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.

Another oral drug, <a href="cladribine">cladribine</a>, was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of the promising efficacy of the drug. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications.

Most of these drugs are approved only for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, <a href="erythema">erythema</a>, pain, <a href="pruritus">pruritus</a>, irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>. They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as <a href="lipoatrophy">lipoatrophy</a>, may develop.

<a href="Interferon">Interferon</a>s, a subclass of <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a>, are produced in the body during illnesses such as <a href="influenza">influenza</a> in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="myalgia">muscle aches</a>, <a href="fatigue%20%28medical%29">fatigue</a>, and <a href="headache">headache</a>s. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter <a href="nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s, such as <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (<a href="Uhthoff%27s%20phenomenon">Uhthoff's phenomenon</a>), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is <a href="spasticity">spasticity</a>. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s (<a href="leukopenia">leukopenia</a>), <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s (<a href="lymphopenia">lymphopenia</a>) and <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a>s (<a href="neutropenia">neutropenia</a>), as well as affect <a href="liver">liver</a> function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory <a href="Blood%20test">blood analyses</a>, including <a href="liver%20function%20tests">liver function tests</a>, to ensure safe use of interferons.

Glatiramer acetate is generally well tolerated. The most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin problem is a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart <a href="palpitation">palpitation</a>s, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require additional treatment.

Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and <a href="hepatotoxicity">liver damage</a>; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related <a href="cardiotoxicity">cardiac toxicity</a>. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring <a href="guideline%20%28medical%29">guidelines</a> is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an <a href="echocardiogram">echocardiogram</a> and a <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a> before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, <a href="infection">infection</a> or liver dysfunction during therapy.
Heart problems (mainly <a href="systolic%20dysfunction">systolic dysfunction</a>) appear in over 10% of patients, while <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> prevalence is 0.8%.

Soon after its approval natalizumab was <a href="list%20of%20withdrawn%20drugs">withdrawn from the market</a> by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called <a href="progressive%20multifocal%20leukoencephalopathy">progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</a> (PML). PML is an <a href="opportunistic%20infection">opportunistic infection</a> with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the <a href="JC%20virus">JC virus</a> in the <a href="Neuroglia">glial cells</a> of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with <a href="interferon%20beta-1a">interferon beta-1a</a>. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.

During clinical trials fingolimod gave rise to side effects such as <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> and <a href="bradycardia">bradycardia</a>, <a href="macular%20edema">macular edema</a>, elevated liver enzymes or reduction in lymphocite levels. Teriflunomide is considered a very safe drug. Nevertheless, there have been reports of liver failure, and PML. Teriflunomide is also known to be <a href="Teratology">dangerous for fetal</a> development. Most common secondary effects of dimethyl fumarate during clinical trials were flushing and gastrointestinal problems. These problems were generally mild and occurred more frequently during the first month of treatment. While dimethyl fumarate leads to a reduction in white blood cell count and levels should be monitored in patients, there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during the clinical trials. Moreover, fumaric acid is also used to treat <a href="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, another autoinmune disorder, and there is long term safety data from over 14 years of use without any indication of further dangerous secondary effects.

The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of <a href="demyelination">demyelination</a> but the patient does not fulfill the <a href="McDonald%20criteria">criteria</a> for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with <a href="interferon">interferon</a>s or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.

Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a>-<a href="MRI%20contrast%20agent">enhanced</a> <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. One of the factors related to non-respondance is the presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a>. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called "rapidly worsening MS" are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab.

Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.

There are no official guidelines yet on the use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to <a href="needle%20phobia">needle phobia</a> or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed <a href="JC%20virus">JC virus</a> antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially one of the most interesting oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.

While more studies of the long-term effects of the drugs are needed, specially for the newest treatments, existing data on the effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes.

<a href="Oral%20contraceptive%20pill">Oral contraceptive pill</a>s have contradictory results from different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate in women with multiple sclerosis. Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as <a href="carbamazepine">carbamazepine</a> (used to treat spasms and pain) and <a href="modafinil">modafinil</a> (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective.

Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most people with relapsing-remitting MS still have some attacks and many develop disability.

Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.

Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in people with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in people after two years. In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent <a href="cardiotoxicity">cardiac toxicity</a> which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.

Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or <a href="riluzole">riluzole</a>. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of <a href="azathioprine">azathioprine</a>, <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a>, <a href="intravenous%20immunoglobulin">intravenous immunoglobulin</a>, <a href="cyclophosphamide">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href="Hematopoietic%20stem%20cell">hematopoietic</a> <a href="stem%20cell%20transplantation">stem cell transplantation</a>.

Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and <a href="Disability">handicap</a>. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.

Symptoms of MS that can be improved include <a href="Fatigue%20%28medical%29">fatigue</a>, <a href="spasticity">spasticity</a>, <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>, bladder dysfunction, and neurological symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by physical therapy and medication. Physical therapists can show strengthening exercises and ways to stretch; ultimately making daily tasks easier and reduces fatigue while muscle strength increases as flexibility increases. Medications can help fatigue, muscle tightness (spasticity), depression, bladder dysfunction, and neurological symptoms. All symptoms are common amongst MS patients.

Both drug therapy and <a href="neurorehabilitation">neurorehabilitation</a> have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.

Although there are relatively few studies of rehabilitation in MS, its general effectiveness, when conducted by a team of specialists, has been clearly demonstrated in other diseases such as <a href="stroke">stroke</a> or <a href="head%20trauma">head trauma</a>. As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a <a href="multidisciplinary">multidisciplinary</a> approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however there are particular difficulties in specifying a 'core team' because people with MS may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point. <a href="Neurologist">Neurologist</a>s are mainly involved in the diagnosis and ongoing management of multiple sclerosis, and any exacerbations. The comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by <a href="physiatrist">physiatrist</a>s. Allied treatments such as <a href="physical%20therapy">physiotherapy</a>, <a href="Speech%20and%20language%20pathology">speech and language therapy</a> or <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a> can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>. Treatment of <a href="neuropsychiatry">neuropsychiatric</a> symptoms such as emotional distress and <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a> should involve <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> professionals such as <a href="therapist">therapist</a>s, <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a>s, and <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>s, while <a href="neuropsychologist">neuropsychologist</a>s can help to evaluate and manage <a href="cognitive%20deficit">cognitive deficit</a>s.
Multidisciplinary approaches have been shown to be effective in increasing activity levels and participation in multiple sclerosis. Due to the paucity of randomized controlled studies, there is limited evidence of the overall efficacy of individual therapy disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, psychology therapies, particularly <a href="cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">cognitive behavioral approaches</a>
and energy conservation instruction
are effective. More specifically psychological interventions seem useful in the treatment of depression, while evidence on effectiveness for other uses such as the treatment of cognitive impairments or vocational counseling is less strong. It is difficult to be specific about what types of rehabilitation will be most beneficial because therapies are tailored to meet the individual's specific needs.

In regards to well-being, physical therapy focused on gait training can be vital to maximizing MS patient participation via reduction of fatigue during walking and <a href="activities%20of%20daily%20living">activities of daily living</a> (ADLs). Most gait training is performed over-ground (i.e., in a gym room or outside on uneven ground), on treadmills or, less commonly, using robotic-assisted devices. <a href="Rehabilitation%20robotics">Robotic-assisted</a> <a href="Gait%20training">body weight-supported treadmill training</a> may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking impairments. In contrast, over-ground gait training may be most effective in improving gait speed in MS patients with less severe impairments. Equine-assisted therapies such as <a href="therapeutic%20horseback%20riding">therapeutic horseback riding</a> and <a href="hippotherapy">hippotherapy</a> are additional treatments that can positively influence gait, balance and quality of life in people with MS.

Historically, individuals with MS were advised against participation in physical activity due to worsening symptoms. However, under the direction of an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all <a href="contraindications">contraindications</a> and precautions.

An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (<a href="hypoesthesia">hypoesthesia</a>), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as <a href="dysarthria">dysarthria</a>) or swallowing (<a href="dysphagia">dysphagia</a>), visual problems (<a href="pathologic%20nystagmus">nystagmus</a>, <a href="optic%20neuritis">optic neuritis</a>, or <a href="diplopia">diplopia</a>), <a href="fatigue%20%28medical%29">fatigue</a> and acute or chronic <a href="pain">pain</a> syndromes, <a href="Urinary%20bladder">bladder</a> and <a href="bowel">bowel</a> difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly <a href="clinical%20depression">depression</a>). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician.


Unfortunately, other symptoms, such as <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>, <a href="tremor">tremor</a> or <a href="sensory%20system">sensory losses</a>, do not have proven treatments.

Research directions on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and the search for effective symptomatic treatments.

Advances during the last decades has led to the recent approval of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being <a href="laquinimod">laquinimod</a>, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the <a href="PEGylation">PEGylated</a> version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.

Monoclonal antibodies, which are drugs of the same family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of interest and research. <a href="Alemtuzumab">Alemtuzumab</a>, <a href="daclizumab">daclizumab</a> and <a href="CD20">CD20</a> monoclonal antibodies such as <a href="rituximab">rituximab</a>, <a href="ocrelizumab">ocrelizumab</a> and <a href="ofatumumab">ofatumumab</a> have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against <a href="JC%20virus">JC virus</a> antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.

Another research strategy is to evaluate the <a href="combination%20therapy">combined effectiveness</a> of two or more drugs. The main rationale for polytherapy in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms of the disease and therefore their use is not necessarily exclusive. Moreover, <a href="Synergy%23Drug%20synergy">synergies</a>, in which a drug potentiates the effect of another are also possible. Nevertheless, there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects. While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS.

Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.

Finally, regarding neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as <a href="stem%20cell%20therapy">stem cell therapy</a>, while their research is considered of high importance at the moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches.

A 2018 study found promising results in relapsing-remitting MS but more research is needed.

In 2008, vascular surgeon <a href="Paolo%20Zamboni">Paolo Zamboni</a> suggested that MS involves a <a href="Circulatory%20system">vascular</a> process he referred to as <a href="chronic%20cerebrospinal%20venous%20insufficiency">chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency</a> (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in all 65 patients with MS in his study. This theory received important attention in the media and among people with MS, specially in Canada. Concern has been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data. Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one. This has raised objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The "liberation procedure" has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven. Currently it is recommended not to use the proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Research on CCSVI has been <a href="FDA%20Fast%20Track%20Development%20Program">fast tracked</a> but researchers have been unable to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS.

Over 50% of MS patients may use <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">complementary and alternative medicine</a>, although numbers vary greatly depending on the definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, it is estimated that 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.

For antioxidant therapy, studies have shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.

Other alternative treatments include <a href="relaxation%20technique">relaxation technique</a>s such as <a href="yoga">yoga</a>, <a href="herbal%20medicine">herbal medicine</a> (including the use of <a href="medical%20cannabis">medical cannabis</a>), <a href="hyperbaric%20oxygenation">hyperbaric oxygenation</a>, self-infection with <a href="hookworm">hookworm</a> (known generally as <a href="helminthic%20therapy">helminthic therapy</a>) and <a href="bee%20venom%20therapy">bee venom therapy</a>, <a href="reflexology">reflexology</a> or <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a>. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time and tend to be more disabled. Moreover, they also have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.

Clinical guidelines: <a href="clinical%20guideline">clinical guideline</a>s are documents with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria in specific areas of healthcare, as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence (<a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>).

The family moved to the suburb of Juhu when Kapoor was one month old. She was educated at the <a href="Arya%20Vidya%20Mandir">Arya Vidya Mandir</a> school in Juhu, where she confessed to being a "naughty" and "carefree" child who would bully the boys.

Kapoor, who practices <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, states that she is "quite religious", and that it is a way of "reminding myself that I need to be thankful for so much".

Kapoor's first job was as a waitress at age 15, although it lasted only a week. As a teenager, she struggled with her weight: "I had every issue related to weight that I could have. I was unhealthy, I had bad skin, and I had hair growing on my face!" Kapoor was diagnosed with <a href="insulin%20resistance">insulin resistance</a> and <a href="polycystic%20ovarian%20disease">polycystic ovarian disease</a>, and has since begun an initiative to increase awareness of <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>. Kapoor enrolled at the <a href="United%20World%20College%20of%20South%20East%20Asia">United World College of South East Asia</a> in Singapore for her pre-university education, where she studied theatre and arts. She has said she later started courses in economics and political science through <a href="University%20of%20Mumbai">University of Mumbai</a> correspondence programme, after returning from <a href="University%20of%20East%20London">University of East London</a> where she began her bachelor's degree in the same subjects but returned to Mumbai soon after she began. The actress <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a>, a family friend, visited her family in Singapore on holiday while working on "<a href="Black%20%282005%20film%29">Black</a>" (2005). Kapoor, who had originally wanted to be a director and writer, expressed a desire to work as a crew member on the film. On her father's recommendation to director <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>, she was appointed as his assistant.

During the production of "Black", Kapoor developed an interest in acting when Bhansali professed that he wanted to cast her in the lead in his next film, "<a href="Saawariya">Saawariya</a>". She was advised to lose weight; at the time, she weighed about . Motivated by Bhansali's confidence in her, she lost in two years. Kapoor studied acting with Roshan Taneja, Jayati Bhatia and <a href="Feroz%20Abbas%20Khan">Feroz Abbas Khan</a>, and has cited actresses <a href="Waheeda%20Rehman">Waheeda Rehman</a> and <a href="Nutan">Nutan</a> as influences, admiring their "path-breaking films ... [and] quality of doing different things".
Released in 2007, "Saawariya" saw Kapoor play a Muslim woman awaiting the return of her lover opposite Mukerji and <a href="Ranbir%20Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a>. It was the first Indian feature film produced by a Hollywood studio, <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Entertainment">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a>. "Saawariya" proved to be a major critical and commercial failure. Writing for <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, Jaspreet Pandohar called the film a "misfire on a massive scale". <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> described her laugh as "almost as infectious as her father's", but wished that she had been "allowed to simper softly, instead of having a clearly overdubbed plastic giggle plastered onto her." The film earned her a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a> nomination and the <a href="Stardust%20Award%20for%20Superstar%20of%20Tomorrow%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Female">Stardust Award for Superstar of Tomorrow – Female</a>.

In 2009, Kapoor played an aspiring singer opposite Waheeda Rehman and <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> in the <a href="Rakeysh%20Omprakash%20Mehra">Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra</a>-directed drama "<a href="Delhi-6">Delhi-6</a>". The film received mixed reviews from critics and was not a box-office success. <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN's</a> <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> referred to Kapoor as a "revelation", writing that she was "a firecracker, instinctive and uninhibited in what isn't even a conventional female lead". Sonia Chopra of <a href="Sify">Sify</a> described Kapoor as an "earnest and effortless performer", and found her character likeable, despite the "typical Delhi-girl recipe".

Kapoor's first release in 2010 was <a href="Punit%20Malhotra">Punit Malhotra's</a> romantic comedy "<a href="I%20Hate%20Luv%20Storys">I Hate Luv Storys</a>", opposite <a href="Imran%20Khan%20%28Bollywood%20actor%29">Imran Khan</a>. She played an engaged woman who develops a one-sided attraction to her commitment-phobic co-worker. Khan said about Kapoor's craft, "We'd be shooting a scene from multiple angles—for three or four hours you're doing the same scene, the same lines—and here is this person [Kapoor] who brings consistency to her work, from the way she talks, to her accent." Although Shubhra Gupta of "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" called Kapoor's performance "stiff and rehearsed", "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" Johnson Thomas found her "likeable and believable". "I Hate Luv Storys" was Kapoor's first commercial success, earning worldwide.

Kapoor next played the eponymous role in "<a href="Aisha%20%28film%29">Aisha</a>", a romantic comedy adaptation of <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen's</a> novel "<a href="Emma%20%28novel%29">Emma</a>", which was produced by her sister Rhea. She described her role opposite <a href="Abhay%20Deol">Abhay Deol</a>, <a href="Ira%20Dubey">Ira Dubey</a> and <a href="Amrita%20Puri">Amrita Puri</a> as "a meddlesome busybody with a passion for matchmaking and playing Cupid". An <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> reviewer thought that Kapoor had stood out with her performance, making "the best of a rather rare opportunity for an Indian leading lady to be part of a Bollywood film that salutes Victorian mores and Delhi's elitist affectations in one clean cool sweep".

In 2011, Kapoor starred in "<a href="Thank%20You%20%282011%20film%29">Thank You</a>", a comedy about three women who teach a lesson to their philandering husbands. The film, along with Kapoor's performance, received poor reviews; <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" called her "terribly out of sync". She then played the romantic interest of <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a> in the <a href="Pankaj%20Kapur">Pankaj Kapur</a>-directed romantic drama, "<a href="Mausam%20%282011%20film%29">Mausam</a>", which was also poorly received. Despite doubts about her acting ability, critic Saibal Chatterjee of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> thought Kapoor conveyed "the essential vulnerability of a girl forever under duress, bringing out just the right mix of feminine fragility and native resolve". The following year, Kapoor played a computer hacker opposite Abhishek Bachchan and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a> in the <a href="Abbas%E2%80%93Mustan">Abbas–Mustan</a>-directed action film, "<a href="Players%20%28film%29">Players</a>", a remake of 2003's "<a href="The%20Italian%20Job%20%282003%20film%29">The Italian Job</a>". Her role was originally written for <a href="Katrina%20Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a>, who was unavailable for the film. Although journalists had high expectations, it failed commercially, and Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com remarked derogatively that Kapoor "truly entertains with her childish attempt to pass off as a Gold-medalist hacker".
Kapoor's string of poorly-received films began to hinder her career.

Kapoor's role in the <a href="Anand%20L.%20Rai">Anand L. Rai</a>-directed romantic drama "<a href="Raanjhanaa">Raanjhanaa</a>" (2013) marked a turning point in her career; Geety Sahgal called it her best performance to date in "The Indian Express". Kapoor's role was that of Zoya Haider, a young <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> student from <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a> who is drawn into politics after the murder of her <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> lover. To prepare for her part, Kapoor interacted with students, attended workshops and practised with theatre groups associated with <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20University">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>. She also studied <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan's</a> work in "<a href="Guddi%20%281971%20film%29">Guddi</a>" (1971), which she felt was "perfect" for her role. Discussing her character in the film, Kapoor described her approach to acting: "I have always tried to do different films and ... I try to be different for every character. I like doing different things to challenge myself in every way and don't like to repeat myself." Although "Raanjhanaa" received mixed reviews, her performance was praised; Rajeev Masand wrote that she "does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability". With worldwide earnings of over , "Raanjhanaa" was a commercial success and Kapoor received her first nomination for the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Actress</a>.

Kapoor followed the success of "Raanjhanaa" with a brief appearance in "<a href="Bhaag%20Milkha%20Bhaag">Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</a>" (2013), a <a href="biographical%20film">biopic</a> on athlete <a href="Milkha%20Singh">Milkha Singh</a>. She received for the film, made on a budget of , citing her admiration for director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and the film itself as reasons for her appearance. Critically praised, "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" was one of the top-grossing Bollywood films of the year. The critic Sarita A. Tanwar wrote in her review that despite her minor role, Kapoor proved to "be the perfect warm counterpart to Milkha". Both "Raanjhanaa" and "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" received <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Filmfare Award for Best Film</a> nominations, the latter of which won.

In 2014, Kapoor portrayed the banker Mayera opposite <a href="Ayushmann%20Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a> and <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a> in the <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> comedy-drama "<a href="Bewakoofiyaan">Bewakoofiyaan</a>", in a role which <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> found to be poorly written and an "uphill climb". She next starred with <a href="Fawad%20Khan">Fawad Khan</a> in the romantic comedy "<a href="Khoobsurat%20%282014%20film%29">Khoobsurat</a>", an adaptation of the <a href="Khubsoorat">1980 film of the same name</a>, playing the role which had originally been given to <a href="Rekha">Rekha</a>. Though she received a Filmfare Best Actress nomination for her performance, critics were divided in their response, with Shilpa Jamkhandikar of <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> calling her "loud and exasperating", and Andy Webster of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" comparing her to a young <a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a> and highlighting her "<a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>-like smile". Later that year she met entrepreneur-model Sahir Berry on a social media network, and began a romantic relationship with him, although they broke up a few months later.

In 2015, Kapoor starred as a runaway bride in "<a href="Dolly%20Ki%20Doli">Dolly Ki Doli</a>", a comedy co-starring <a href="Pulkit%20Samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a>, <a href="Rajkummar%20Rao">Rajkummar Rao</a> and <a href="Varun%20Sharma">Varun Sharma</a>. "<a href="Mint%20%28newspaper%29">Mint</a>"s Udita Jhunjhunwala criticised Kapoor's performance in the film, writing that her "range is too limited to bring alive a character that may have had heaps of potential on paper". Shubhra Gupta wrote: "Kapoor is in almost every frame, and should have filled them all. But the treatment of the character shows up her limitations." Despite the negative reviews for her performance, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. While filming <a href="Sooraj%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BR.%20Barjatya">SoorajR. Barjatya's</a> "<a href="Prem%20Ratan%20Dhan%20Payo">Prem Ratan Dhan Payo</a>" with <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> in <a href="Gondal%2C%20India">Gondal</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> in February 2015, Kapoor was diagnosed with <a href="swine%20influenza">swine influenza</a>, from which she recovered the following month. Kapoor portrayed Rajkumari Maithili Devi, a princess looking for love. The film became one of the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films">highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time</a>. She was praised by Rachit Gupta for her credibility as a royal, and <a href="Komal%20Nahta">Komal Nahta</a> thought that the role was significant enough to be a turning point in her career. However, she won a <a href="Golden%20Kela%20Awards">Golden Kela Award</a> for Worst Actress.

Following an appearance in the music video of <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay's</a> "<a href="Hymn%20for%20the%20Weekend">Hymn for the Weekend</a>" (featuring <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>), Kapoor starred in <a href="Ram%20Madhvani">Ram Madhvani's</a> biographical thriller "<a href="Neerja">Neerja</a>" (2016). She was cast as the eponymous air hostess <a href="Neerja%20Bhanot">Neerja Bhanot</a>, who died while saving the passengers of the hijacked <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%2073">Pan Am Flight 73</a> in 1986. Kapoor felt responsible towards the project because it is about real events, and met Bhanot's family as a preparation for her role. The film garnered wide critical acclaim, and several commentators considered Kapoor's performance to be her best to date. Raja Sen found her performance to be career-defining, while "Hindustan Times" Rohit Vats wrote that "she carries [the film] entirely on her shoulder. She looks earnest, scared, benevolent and bold, all at the same time." Sen listed Kapoor as the best actress in Hindi cinema in 2016, while Rajeev Masand invited her to his annual best actresses roundtable. In addition to several other accolades, Kapoor won the <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Special%20Mention%20%28Feature%20Film%29">National Film Award – Special Mention</a>. With a worldwide gross over , "Neerja" emerged as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist.
After a two-year absence from the screen, Kapoor played a social worker in <a href="R.%20Balki">R. Balki</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Pad%20Man%20%28film%29">Pad Man</a>" (2018), based on a short story in <a href="Twinkle%20Khanna">Twinkle Khanna</a>'s book "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Lakshmi%20Prasad">The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad</a>". Co-starring <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> and <a href="Radhika%20Apte">Radhika Apte</a>, the film is inspired by the life of <a href="Arunachalam%20Muruganantham">Arunachalam Muruganantham</a>, who campaigned for menstrual hygiene in rural India. Kapoor said that the length of the role is of little importance to her as long as the film has "relevance beyond just having a good time at the movies". She liked featuring in a film that addresses important social issues and is about something more than just entertainment. Although finding her role to be "largely superfluous", Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Kapoor "makes the most of the limited opportunity"; <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" commended her screen presence but disliked a romantic subplot involving her and Kumar, criticising the chemistry and age-gap between them. 

On 8 May 2018, Kapoor married Indian businessman Anand Ahuja in a traditional Sikh ceremony in <a href="Bandra">Bandra</a>. The following month, she featured in <a href="Shashanka%20Ghosh">Shashanka Ghosh</a>'s "<a href="Veere%20Di%20Wedding">Veere Di Wedding</a>", a <a href="female%20buddy%20film">female buddy film</a> co-starring <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a>, <a href="Swara%20Bhaskar">Swara Bhaskar</a> and Shikha Talsania. "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" Namrita Joshi found the film formulaic and clichéd, while Sweta Kaushal of "Hindustan Times" thought the film had "style but no soul" and was partly impressed with Kapoor's performance. With earnings of over , the film proved to her second top-grossing Hindi film not featuring a well-known male star. Later that month, Kapoor featured in <a href="Rajkumar%20Hirani">Rajkumar Hirani</a>'s biopic of the actor <a href="Sanjay%20Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a>, entitled "<a href="Sanju">Sanju</a>", as one of Dutt's love interests. Kapoor said that despite her brief role, she agreed to the project to work with Hirani and to reunite with Ranbir Kapoor after her debut. Anna M. M. Vetticad criticised the film's attempt to whitewash Dutt's misdeeds, but found Kapoor's portrayal of her small role "sweet". On the other hand, Rajeev Masand called the film "consistently engaging", and wrote that Kapoor "hit the right notes as Sanjay Dutt’s [partner]". "Sanju" broke several box-office records, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films.

In 2019, Kapoor starred in the coming-of-age film "<a href="Ek%20Ladki%20Ko%20Dekha%20Toh%20Aisa%20Laga">Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga</a>", co-starring her father, <a href="Juhi%20Chawla">Juhi Chawla</a>, and Rajkummar Rao. She played a closeted lesbian who has trouble coming out to her conservative family. She agreed to the project to break stereotypes about same-sex relationships in India. Critics praised the film for its progressive story and for pushing boundaries in Hindi cinema, but it failed to do well commercially. Kapoor will next star in <a href="Abhishek%20Sharma%20%28director%29">Abhishek Sharma</a>'s <a href="The%20Zoya%20Factor%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a> of <a href="Anuja%20Chauhan">Anuja Chauhan</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Zoya%20Factor">The Zoya Factor</a>", in which she plays the titular character.

Born into a prominent actor family, Kapoor has appeared in the media from an early age,
and is one of the highest-paid actresses in Bollywood. After the success of "Raanjhanaa" and "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" she was cited by <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> as one of the top actresses in India, though a commentator for Rediff.com notes that several of her films have been commercial failures. In 2009 she was the first Indian actress to appear on "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" "Next Generation: Asia Class", a list of newcomers in film. Outspoken publicly, Kapoor's comments about contemporaries and others in the Indian film industry have occasionally caused controversy. In a 2015 interview, she acknowledged that her opinions often get her into trouble, but remarked that "I believe it pays to be honest in the longer run".

Kapoor is a popular figure nationally, with a significant following on Twitter since 2009 and Facebook. She appeared on "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" list of "100 most influential women on Twitter" in 2015. She has been described by the media as a style icon, and featured on Rediff.com's list of "Bollywood's Best Dressed Actresses" in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, the newspaper "Hindustan Times" and Indian edition of "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" called her Style Icon (Reader's Choice) and Beauty of the Year, respectively. Though Kapoor has earned praise for her dress sense and style, she has faced some criticism for wearing traditional Indian dresses.

Kapoor was ranked seventh on "The Times of India" 2010 "Most Desirable Woman" list, placing 14th, 28th and 14th the next three years, and was in the top ten of UK magazine "<a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a>" "World's Sexiest Asian Women" list from 2011 to 2014. In 2012 and 2013 she also held 48th and 45th place, respectively, on the <a href="Forbes%20India">Indian edition</a> of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" "Celebrity 100" lists, based on the income and popularity of Indian celebrities. She was named Woman of the Year by the men's magazine "<a href="GQ%20%28Indian%20edition%29">GQ India</a>" in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, Kapoor reached 31st place and 26th position, respectively, peaking at the 18th position the following year with an annual income of . Kapoor has acquired several titles at the "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" Glamour and Style Awards—in 2015 she won for Most Stylish Star (Female) and Absolut Elyx Style & Substance Award, and in 2016, she was named Most Stylish Star (Female) and Red Carpet Royalty.

In 2011, she was named Brand Ambassador of the Year at the NDTV Good Times Gadget Guru Awards. Rediff.com reported in 2012 that she received for each endorsement, making her one of the highest-paid celebrity endorsers in India.

Kapoor has supported charitable organisations for various causes. In 2009, she participated in the <a href="International%20Indian%20Film%20Academy%20Awards">International Indian Film Academy Awards</a> fashion show, which supports widows and orphans of Indian film-industry workers. On behalf of <a href="People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals%23PETA%20Asia-Pacific">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) she wrote to Maharashtra <a href="Minister%20of%20Home%20Affairs%20%28India%29">Home Minister</a> <a href="R.%20R.%20Patil">R.

In 2018, however, she attracted some controversy when she declared her support for Salman Khan upon his conviction for hunting an endangered <a href="blackbuck">blackbuck</a>, despite her previous criticism of trophy hunting.

In 2012, Kapoor asked fans to donate to the Ogaan Cancer Foundation for her birthday, and collaborated with the foundation to increase awareness of <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>. She is also the <a href="brand%20ambassador">brand ambassador</a> for the Elle Breast Cancer Campaign.

She launched the trailer of the film, "<a href="Sisak%20%28film%29">Sisak</a>", India's first silent gay love story, through her Twitter account in January 2017.

Kapoor auctioned some of her clothes on stylist Pernia Qureshi's online fashion boutique, Pernia's Pop-Up Shop, in 2012. The proceeds were donated to <a href="Smile%20Foundation">Smile Foundation</a>, a child-welfare organisation.

The Sinking of the Lusitania

The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) is a <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> animated <a href="short%20film">short film</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. It is a work of <a href="propaganda%20film">propaganda</a> re-creating the never-photographed 1915 <a href="Sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Lusitania">sinking of the British liner RMS "Lusitania"</a>. At twelve minutes it has been called the longest work of animation at the time of its release. The film is the earliest surviving <a href="animated%20documentary">animated documentary</a> and serious, dramatic work of animation. The <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> selected it for preservation in 2017.

In 1915 a <a href="U-boat">German submarine</a> torpedoed and sank the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a>; 128 Americans were among the 1,198 dead. The event outraged McCay, but the newspapers of his employer <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> downplayed the event, as Hearst was opposed to the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">US joining World War I</a>. McCay was required to illustrate anti-war and anti-British editorial cartoons for Hearst's papers. In 1916, McCay rebelled against his employer's stance and began work on the patriotic "Sinking of the Lusitania" on his own time with his own money.

The film followed McCay's earlier successes in animation: "<a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">Little Nemo</a>" (1911), "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" (1912), and "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>" (1914). McCay drew these earlier films on <a href="rice%20paper">rice paper</a>, onto which backgrounds had to be laboriously traced; "The Sinking of the Lusitania" was the first film McCay made using the new, more efficient <a href="cel">cel</a> technology. McCay and his assistants spent twenty-two months making the film. His subsequent animation output suffered setbacks, as the film was not as commercially successful as his earlier efforts, and Hearst put increased pressure on McCay to devote his time to editorial drawings.

The film opens with a live-action prologue in which McCay busies himself studying a picture of the "Lusitania" as a model for his film-in-progress. <a href="Intertitle">Intertitle</a>s boast of McCay as "the originator and inventor of Animated Cartoons", and of the 25,000 drawings needed to complete the film. McCay is shown working with a group of anonymous assistants on "the first record of the sinking of the "Lusitania"".

The liner passes the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> and leaves <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a>. After some time, a <a href="U-boat">German submarine</a> cuts through the waters and fires a torpedo at the "Lusitania", which billows smoke that builds until it envelops the screen. Passengers scramble to lower lifeboats, some of which capsize in the confusion. The liner tilts from one side to the other and passengers are tossed into the ocean.

A second blast rocks the "Lusitania", which sinks slowly into the deep as more passengers fall off its edges, and the ship submerges amid scenes of drowning bodies. The liner vanishes from sight, and the film closes with a mother struggling to keep her baby above the waves. An intertitle declares: "The man who fired the shot was decorated for it by the Kaiser! "And yet they tell us not to hate the Hun"".

<a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a> (–1934) produced prodigiously detailed and accurate drawings since early in life. He earned a living as a young man drawing portraits and posters in <a href="dime%20museum">dime museum</a>s, and attracted large crowds with his ability to draw quickly in public. He began working as a newspaper illustrator full-time in 1898, and in 1903 began drawing comic strips. His greatest comic strip success was the children's fantasy comic strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>", which he began in 1905. In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing <a href="chalk%20talk">chalk talk</a>s—performances during which he drew in front of a live audience.

Inspired by the <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>s his son brought home, McCay said he "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures" of his cartoons. His first animated film, "<a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">Little Nemo</a>" (1911), was composed of four thousand drawings on <a href="rice%20paper">rice paper</a>. His next film, "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" (1912), naturalistically shows a giant mosquito draw blood from a sleeping man until it burst. McCay followed this with a film that became an interactive part of his <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> shows: in "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>" (1914), McCay commanded his animated dinosaur with a whip on stage.

The British liner <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a> briefly held the record for <a href="Timeline%20of%20largest%20passenger%20ships">largest passenger ship</a> upon its completion in 1906. McCay displayed a fondness for it, and featured it in the episode for September 28, 1907, of his comic strip "<a href="Dream%20of%20the%20Rarebit%20Fiend">Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</a>", and again in the episode for November 10, 1908, of "<a href="A%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress%20by%20Mister%20Bunion">A Pilgrim's Progress by Mister Bunion</a>", where Bunion declares it "the monster boat that has smashed the record".

The Germans <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">employed submarines in the North Atlantic</a> during World War I, and in April 1915 the German government issued a warning that it would target British civilian ships. The "Lusitania" was <a href="Sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Lusitania">torpedoed</a> on May 7, 1915, during a voyage from New York; 128 Americans were among the 1,198 who lost their lives. Newspapers owned by McCay's employer <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> downplayed the tragedy, as Hearst was opposed to the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">US entering the war</a>. His own papers' readers were increasingly pro-war in the aftermath of the "Lusitania". McCay was as well, but was required to illustrate anti-war and anti-British editorials by editor <a href="Arthur%20Brisbane">Arthur Brisbane</a>. In 1916, McCay rebelled against his employer's stance and began to make the pro-war "Sinking of the Lusitania" in his own time.

The sinking itself was never photographed. McCay said that he gathered background details on the "Lusitania" from Hearst's Berlin correspondent August F. Beach, who was in London at the time of the disaster and was the first reporter at the scene. The film was the first attempt at a serious, dramatic work of animation.

"The Sinking of the Lusitania" took twenty-two months to complete. McCay had assistance from his neighbor, artist John Fitzsimmons, and from Cincinnati cartoonist William Apthorp "Ap" Adams, who took care of layering the cels in proper sequence for shooting. Fitzsimmons was responsible for a sequence of waves, sixteen frames to be cycled over McCay's drawings. McCay provided illustrations during the day for the newspapers of William Randolph Hearst, and spent his off hours at home drawing the cels for the film, which he took to <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> to be photographed.

McCay's working methods were laborious. On "Gertie the Dinosaur" an assistant painstakingly traced and retraced the backgrounds thousands of times. Rival animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the increasing demand for animated films. Within a few years of "Nemo"s release, it became near-universal practice in animation studios to use American <a href="Earl%20Hurd">Earl Hurd</a>'s <a href="cel">cel</a> technology, combined with Canadian <a href="Raoul%20Barr%C3%A9">Raoul Barré</a>'s registration pegs, used to keep cels aligned when photographed. Hurd had patented the cel method in 1914; it saved work by allowing dynamic drawings to be drawn on one or more layers, which could be laid over a static background layer, relieving animators of the tedium of retracing static images onto drawing after drawing. McCay adopted the cel method beginning with "The Sinking of the Lusitania".

As with all his films, McCay financed "Lusitania" himself. The cels were an added expense, but greatly reduced the amount of drawing necessary in contrast to McCay's earlier methods. The cels used were thicker than those that later became industry standard, and had a "tooth", or rough surface, that could hold pencil, <a href="wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">wash</a>, and crayon, as well as ink lines. The amount of rendering caused the cels to buckle, which made it difficult to keep them aligned for photographing; Fitzsimmons addressed this problem using a modified loose-leaf binder.

McCay said it took him about eight weeks to produce eight seconds worth of film. The claimed 25,000 drawings filled 900 feet of film. "Lusitania" was registered for copyright on July 19, 1918, and was released by <a href="Jewel%20Productions">Jewel Productions</a> who were reported to have acquired it for the highest price paid for a one-reel film up to that time. It was included as part of a <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> Weekly <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a> and featured on the cover of an issue of Universal's in-house publication "The Moving Picture Weekly". Its première in England followed in May 1919. Advertisements called it "he world's only record of the crime that shocked humanity".

The animation combines editorial cartooning techniques with live-action-like sequences, and is considered McCay's most realistic effort; the intertitles emphasized that the film was a "historical record" of the event. McCay animated the action in what animation historian Donald Crafton describes as a "realistic graphic style". The film has a dark mood and strong propagandist feel. It depicts the terrifying fates of the passengers, such as the drowning of children and human chains of passengers jumping to their deaths. The artwork is highly detailed, the animation fluid and naturalistic. McCay used <a href="Cross-cutting">alternating shots</a> to simulate the feel of a newsreel, which reinforced the film's realistic feel.

McCay made stylistic choices to add emotion to the "historical record", as in the anxiety-inducing shots of the submarines lurking beneath the surface, and abstract styling of the white sheets of sky and sea, vast voids which engorge themselves on the drowning bodies. Animation historian Paul Wells suggested the <a href="negative%20space">negative space</a> in the frames filled viewers with anxiety through <a href="psychological%20projection">psychological projection</a> or <a href="introjection">introjection</a>, <a href="Psychoanalysis">Freudian</a> ideas that had begun circulating in the years before the film's release. Scholar Ulrich Merkl suggests that as a newspaperman, McCay was likely aware of Freud's widely reported work, though McCay never publicly acknowledged such an influence.

"The Sinking of the Lusitania" was noted as a work of <a href="war%20film">war</a> propaganda, and is often called the longest work of animation of its time. The film is likely the earliest <a href="animated%20documentary">animated documentary</a>. McCay's biographer, animator <a href="John%20Canemaker">John Canemaker</a>, called "The Sinking of the Lusitania" "a monumental work in the history of the animated film". Though it was admired by his animation contemporaries, Canemaker wrote that it "did not revolutionize the film cartoons of its time" as McCay's skills were beyond what animators of the time were able to follow. In the era that followed, animation studios made occasional non-fiction films, but most were comedic shorts lasting no more than seven minutes. Animation continued in its role of supporting feature films rather than as the main attraction, and rarely received reviews. "Lusitania" was not a commercial success; after a few years in theaters, "Lusitania" brought McCay about $80,000. McCay made at least seven further films, only three of which are known to have seen commercial release.

After 1921, when Hearst learned McCay devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations, Hearst required McCay to give up animation. He had plans for several animation projects that never came to fruition, including a collaboration with "Jungle Imps" author <a href="George%20Randolph%20Chester">George Randolph Chester</a>, a musical film called "The Barnyard Band", and a film about the Americans' role in World War I. Later in life, McCay at times publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the animation industry as it had become—he had envisioned animation as an art, and lamented how it had become a trade. According to Canemaker, it was not until <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Disney</a>'s feature films in the 1930s that the animation industry caught up with McCay's level of technique.

Animation historian Paul Wells described "Lusitania" as "a seminal moment in the development of the animated film" for its combination of documentary style with propagandist elements, and considered it an example of animation as a form of <a href="Modernism">Modernism</a>. Steve Bottomore called the film "he most significant cinematic version of the disaster". A review in "The Cinema" praised the film, especially the scene in which the first torpedo explodes, which it called "more than reality". The <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> selected the film for preservation in 2017.

Pilot (House)

"Pilot", also known as "Everybody Lies", is the first episode of the U.S. television series "<a href="House%20%28TV%20series%29">House</a>". The episode premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on November 16, 2004. It introduces the character of Dr. <a href="Gregory%20House">Gregory House</a> (played by <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a>)—a maverick antisocial doctor—and his team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro <a href="Teaching%20Hospital">Teaching Hospital</a> in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. The episode features House's attempts to diagnose a kindergarten teacher after she collapses in class.

"House" was created by <a href="David%20Shore">David Shore</a>, who got the idea for the <a href="Misanthropy">misanthropic</a> title character from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer <a href="Bryan%20Singer">Bryan Singer</a> wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>—both are <a href="drug%20user">drug user</a>s, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.

The episode received generally positive reviews; the character of House was widely noted as a unique aspect of the episode and series, though some reviewers believed that such a cruel character would not be tolerated in real life. Other complaints with the episode included stereotyped supporting characters and an implausible premise. The initial broadcast of "Pilot" was watched by approximately seven million viewers, making it the 62nd-most-watched show of the week.

Shortly after the start of class, kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler becomes <a href="Aphasia">dysphasic</a> and experiences seizures. Dr. <a href="James%20Wilson%20%28House%29">James Wilson</a> attempts to convince Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. <a href="Lisa%20Cuddy">Lisa Cuddy</a> ) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.

Adler's throat closes up during the MRI due to an allergic reaction to <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a>, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. <a href="Robert%20Chase">Robert Chase</a> (<a href="Jesse%20Spencer">Jesse Spencer</a>) and Dr. <a href="Allison%20Cameron">Allison Cameron</a> (<a href="Jennifer%20Morrison">Jennifer Morrison</a>), to perform a <a href="tracheotomy">tracheotomy</a>. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient is a man who is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (<a href="niacin">niacin</a>). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his <a href="Metered-dose%20inhaler">asthmatic inhaler</a> only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticizes the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral <a href="vasculitis">vasculitis</a>, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure.

On House's insistence, neurologist Dr. <a href="Eric%20Foreman">Eric Foreman</a> and Cameron break into Adler's house to find anything that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of ham in Adler's kitchen and House concludes that she is suffering from <a href="cysticercosis">cysticercosis</a> from eating undercooked pork. Adler refuses to accept more treatments unless there is evidence that the diagnosis is correct. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.

Series creator David Shore traced the concept for "House" to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness...] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched "House" to Fox as a medical detective show—a hospital <a href="whodunit">whodunit</a> where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question "Why am I wasting your time?".

A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did not want the character to be that young.

The episode was written by the series creator David Shore, and was shot in Canada; later episodes would be shot on soundstages in California. Shore said that the writings of <a href="Berton%20Rouech%C3%A9">Berton Roueché</a>, a "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" staff writer who chronicled intriguing medical cases, inspired the plots for "Pilot" and other early episodes.

Producer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play the role of House; according to Singer, the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part, the more sure he was that an American was needed. At the time of casting, Hugh Laurie was filming the movie "<a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Phoenix%20%282004%20film%29">Flight of the Phoenix</a>". He put together an audition tape in a Namibian hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a "<a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">bin Laden</a> video"). Laurie improvised by using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was impressed by Laurie's performance and commented on how well the "American actor" grasped the character, not realizing Laurie was British.

Laurie initially believed that House was merely the "sidekick" of Wilson, because the script referred to Wilson as a doctor with "boyish" looks. Laurie did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay. According to Shore, "it's easy to make an asshole character unlikable. What's tricky is to make them watchable. And Hugh came in and brought everything that
was there to the part, the nastiness, the not politically correct stuff. And yet you wanted to watch him, you wanted to spend time with him."

Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> appear in the pilot; Shore explained that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.

Robert Sean Leonard (Dr. James Wilson) read the pilot scripts to "<a href="Numb3rs">Numb3rs</a>" and was planning to audition for the part, but was drawn to auditioning for "House" because he enjoyed the role of being "the guy [the protagonist] counts on", as well as the similarities to Sherlock Holmes. Leonard felt he did not audition well, and thought his long friendship with Singer helped land him the role. When asked in an interview why his character would ever be friends with House, Leonard replied:

Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to "<a href="General%20Hospital">General Hospital</a>". Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show "<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>". Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.

"House"s premiere episode was generally well received. Critics reacted positively to the character of House; <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> of "The Washington Post" called him "the most electrifying character to hit television in years". "The New York Magazine" called the series "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic", and stated that the cast consisted of "<nowiki>[professional]</nowiki> actors playing doctors who come to care about their patients", while "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"s Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the episode did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about "<a href="health%20maintenance%20organization">HMO</a> factories". Alessandra Stanley of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said that though the characters might be a turn-off to some viewers, the gore and "derivative gall" of the show were positives to fans of procedural dramas; "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>"s Matt Roush stated "House" was an "uncommon cure for the common medical drama". Critics of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" called "House" the "nastiest" <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> from Fox since the 1996's short-lived television series "<a href="Profit%20%28TV%20series%29">Profit</a>". Critics considered the series to be a bright spot among Fox's otherwise <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a>-based broadcast schedule.

The episode's format was compared to a rival television series, "<a href="Medical%20Investigation">Medical Investigation</a>". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" favorably stated "House" as more character-driven than "Investigation"s "plot-driven procedural", and the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" felt that "House" was the better show due to the title character. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Brian Lowry, meanwhile, stated that the two shows were too similar and "House" was mismatched among Fox's other programs. Other complaints included perceived stereotypes of young, attractive doctors. <a href="Sherwin%20Nuland">Sherwin Nuland</a> of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" gave the first episodes of the series a highly negative review, stating that "Of all the medical errata in this series (and there are some whoppers), the greatest is surely the conceit that a physician so remote, so neglectful of duty, so sadistic, so downright cruel as Gregory House would be tolerated in any 
hospital." Kay McFadden of "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" felt that Laurie's portrayal of House humanized the character, but also revealed the show's deepest flaw: "a reliance on shallow cuteness for comic relief". Other complaints included a lack of characterization for the supporting characters in the first few episodes.

The premiere attracted approximately seven million viewers in the United States, making it the 62nd-most-watched show for the week of November 15–21, 2004. The United Kingdom terrestrial premiere was broadcast on June 9, 2005, by <a href="Five%20%28TV%20channel%29">Five</a> and garnered a ten percent share (1.8 million viewers). Christopher Hoag, who composed the music for "Pilot" and the first season of "House", was nominated in the <a href="57th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">2005 Primetime Emmy Awards</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Music%20Composition%20for%20a%20Series">Outstanding Music Composition</a> for the episode. Shore received a <a href="Humanitas%20Prize">Humanitas Prize</a> nomination for writing the episode, but lost out to <a href="John%20Wells%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Wells</a>, who wrote the episode of "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>" entitled "<a href="NSF%20Thurmont%20%28The%20West%20Wing%29">NSF Thurmont</a>".
